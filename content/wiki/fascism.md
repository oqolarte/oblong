Merriam-Webster [defines it as](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fascism):
> a political philosophy, movement, or regime
> (such as that of the Fascisti)
> that exalts nation and often race above the individual
> and that stands for a centralized autocratic government
> headed by a dictatorial leader,
> severe economic and social regimentation,
> and forcible suppression of opposition.

In short, it's an ideology characterized by extreme nationalism and
social conservatism, the combo of which dictates that certain types of
people are inferior.

## Describing what it is

Fascism is caused by [making people believe through propaganda](/consent)
that power comes from the position of
leadership itself. For example, if someone is able to use force and
intimidation to get elected president of a country, then they're a
legitimate leader and should have all the power and respect that
position entails, and their leadership should be followed.

In extreme examples we see people in positions of leadership who exempt
themselves from the laws or change the laws after the fact to make their
past crimes legal. This behavior only makes sense if we think that
having the position of "president" gives the person the powers and
rights of the leader of the executive office *regardless of how the
achieved that position.*

A belief that it's the position that matters, and not the support of the
people, or the democratic process, etc. that matters, then that means
two things:
- Corrupt and immoral people will try and gain the position of
  leadership. It's more attractive to be the leader if you can erase
  past crimes and enrich yourself without consequences.
- Fascist leaders will need to continue to convince people to continue
  to accept them. This is where nationalism, segregation, and fear of
  outsiders are extremely useful. Putting social structures in place
  that entrench the existing leadership will eventually be the only way
  to hold on to power in a fascist government.

## Chicken and egg

- The first casualties of fascist regimes are the minority, the
  vulnerable, and the different.
- Perhaps, we in this modern and complicated anthropocene are capable of
  turning into fascists ourselves, if a shadow tyrant (i.e., someone who wants
  power to control everyone) charming enough shows up at *just the right
  time* in our lives.

## Characteristics

[Lawrence Britt identified 14 characteristics](https://www.ratical.org/ratville/CAH/fasci14chars.txt) that make up a fascist government:

1. Fascist regimes promote flags, patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols,
   songs, and other nationalistic propaganda.
2. People in fascist regimes look the other way when the state violates
   human rights, out of fear of enemies and the need for [security](/security).
3. People are rallied against a single common enemy:
    1. racial, ethinic or religious minorities
    2. liberals
    3. communists
    4. socialists
    5. terrorists
    6. etc.
4. Fascist regimes prioritize support for military, even when there are
   more significant domestic problems that need to be addressed.
5. Fascist governments tend to be male-dominated with rampant sexism.
6. Fascist governments have great influence (sometimes having direct
   control over) mass media.
7. Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the
   masses.
8. Fascist government tend to use the most common religion to control
   public opinion.
9. Fascist governments have symbiotic relationships with corporations.
10. Labor unions are either eliminated or severely suppressed.
11. Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to
    higher education, and academia. To them, thinking is a form of
    emasculation.
12. Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power
    to enforce laws.
13. Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and
    associates who appoint each other to government positions and use
    governmental power and authority to protect their friends from
    accountability.
14. Fascist nations are riddled with fraudulent elections.

## Note on Nazis

The Nazis that in movies are as much a historical fantasy as Vikings
with horned helmets and samurai cutting people in half.

The Nazis were not some vague evils that wanted to hurt people for the
sake of hurting them. They had specific goals which furthered a
far-right agenda, and they wanted to do harm to very specific groups,
(largely Slavs, Jews, Romani, queer people, communists/leftists, and
disabled people.)

The Nazis were the white people's (more) evil doppelganger. Hitler
himself said that he drew inspiration from the genocidal regime of the
British empire and from other racial atrocities happening in North
America, even co-opting the [Roman salute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_salute) and [swastika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swastika).

The Nazis didn't use soldiers in creepy gas masks as their main imagery
that they sold to the German people; they used blond-haired blue-eyed
families. Nor did they stand up on podiums saying they would wage an
endless and brutal war; they gave speeches about protecting white
Christian society from degenerates just like how conservatives do today.

Nazis weren't atheists or pagans. They were deeply Christian and
Christianity was part of their ideology just like it is for modern
conservatives. They spoke at lengths about defending their Christian
nation from godless leftism. The ones who hated the Catholic church
hated it for protestant reasons. Nazi occultism was fringe within the
party and never expected to become mainstream, and those occultists were
still Christian, none of them ever claimed to be Satanists or Asatru.

Nazis were also not queer or disabled. They killed those groups, before
they had a chance to kill almost anyone else. Despite the amount of
disabled Nazis or queer/queer coded Nazis you'll see in movies and on
TV, they were very cishet and very able bodied. There was one high
ranking Nazi early on who was gay and the other Nazis killed him for
that. Saying the Nazis were gay or disabled makes about as much sense as
saying they were Jewish.

The Nazis weren't mentally ill. As previously mentioned, they hated
disabled people, and this unquestionably included anyone neurodivergent.
When the surviving nazi war criminals were given psychological tests
after the war, they were shown to be some of the most neurotypical
people out there.

The Nazis were NOT socialists. They *hated* socialists. They got
elected on hating socialists. They killed socialists. Hating all forms
of leftism was a big part of their ideology, and especially a big part
of how they sold themselves.

The Nazis were not the supervillains you see on screen, not because they
didn't do horrible things in real life, they most certainly did, but
because they weren't that vague apolitical evil that exists for white
American action heroes to fight. They did horrible things because they
had a right-wing authoritarian political ideology, an ideology that is
fundamentally the same as what most of the modern right wing believes.

## How to fight fascism

And not be fully consumed by hate and anger? Let us count some ways:

- Noam Chomsky advises: "The way to avoid despair is to recognize how
  much you can achieve if you devote yourself to it."
- Dance. Yes, really. [Revolution](/revolution) must have the space for
  it, and for other ways of expressing [joy](/joy).
- Take care of your [health](/health) so you can also take care of
  others.
- [Build a community](/community) around something fun. Whether it's a
  hobby like playing sports, or a noble cause like [giving free food to strangers](/feeding),
  bonding on something common is essential in
  making stronger relationships with peers.
- Fascists thrive on fear, so why not [make art](/art) to make them look
  dumb?
- Whenever possible, [love](/love), as cheesy as it is.

Of course, there are infinite ways to fight fascism. Hopefully, the
above items can help us get started.
