If reading bell hooks has taught me anything,
it is that [choosing love](/love) is a complex maze of reasoning
with myself and the people I have met so far.
It is a strange thing, one that I dare not even describe with limiting
words. I can only feel it in unplottable sinusoids,
especially the last whole six years of it,
with Isya[^69] who, statistically speaking, has been with me the most in that
time frame. As of writing, I hope that I get to spend more time with
them, at least, nine more years.

[^69]: We like inside jokes. This post contains one, if *you* can see
it.
