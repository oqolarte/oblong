- Fixed typo in the last log.
- Added a new section to a log from last year, [the music that reminds me of
  that time](/esmeris)
- Deleted an item from [Support](/support).
- On the aesthetic side of things, I updated the color of `a:hover` (link hover) from
  `#69bb69` to `#36ca5c`. A slightly more vibrant apple green, if you know what
  I mean.
- Added three new entries and two new one-liners to [Imbentori](/imbentori).

As if to respond to my whining yesterday,
it rained today for the most part of the daytime.

The kind of rain that both releases the heat trapped beneath the earth,
and keeps them in the air long enough to cause some mild annoyances.

And still, in act of defying discomfort by merely existing,
I try to tell myself: I'm exactly where I need to be.
