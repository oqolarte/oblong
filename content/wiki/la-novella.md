## Dedication (?)

ACROSS ALL TIMES AND ALL WORLDS:
To past me who could not have imagined them;
to Isya here and now;
and to the blooming flora and fauna that *will* rise from the ruins of
Empire in the distant future and dimensions

## One-sentence pitch

A radical cook uses his own flesh as an ingredient to end Hunger.

## One-paragraph pitch

A cook with super-regeneration decides bands with his friends to open a
small diner in an effort to feed as many people in his community at an
affordable price. His mad idea is to offer himself, literally, as an
ingredient in the food, by cutting the bone and flesh (since it will
grow back anyway), [preserving it](/meat-preservation) in a way, and
then preparing meals. To scale their operations, they try to secure
funding from investors from within their social circles. In succeeding
operations, he discovers it's harder to keep this unorthodox way a
secret from people. If they were to build a future they want, how could
he cultivate trust among them while keeping his secret? He also notices
that his regeneration rate is getting longer depending on how severe and
frequent his wounds are, until it reaches a point that it's taking years
for him to heal.

## Characters

### List of characters

- An eccentric group of three people called Sunshine:
        - glam model, photog, make-up artist
        - Glam model is a conventionally attractive woman in her early 20s
        - Photographer is mid-30s, a bi-femme that leans towards butch side
        - Make-up artist is a queer guy, who's roughly the same age as the
          model; they're former classmates in a well known art school in Manila.
- 4 main conflicting characters, also with superhuman abilities:
        - Amorsolo (like the famous painter), a self-taught chef with
          incredible self-regeneration (anarch)
        - Pete, charms their way out of problems, and way into solutions
          ([fasc](/fascism))
        - Krima, who has never received any kind of physical harm in
          their life. As soon as the harm-doer has decided to inflict
          harm on them, harm-doer inflicts it on themself at the very
          last moment. Krima will also learn to extend this ability to
          other people over short distances depending on their mastery.
        - Lovelyn, is just so damn lucky. But her luck is a function of
          her active participation in any given situation.
- A rich aswang (politico? businessman? both?) has domestics helpers who
  are overworked and underpaid. They plan to escape their master.
- Entrepreneur/chismis lord who has cleaning business, employing people
  (middle aged women and/or queer people, mostly, because "they are
  trustworthy") who go through the trash of celebrities who hire them
  for their deep cleaning services in search for the latest "chizmax"
  (gossip).
- Another entrepreneur who dreams of being a billionaire no matter what,
  just so he could be able to help others through charity. It is not
  lost on him the irony of reaching the billionaire status might also
  require him to step on other people. In his quest, he constantly runs
  into moral quandaries and tries to refine his methods. Wil he end up
  being a billionaire?
- Peil Badaran - first partner/ex of Amor, so named by her parents
  because of her unnaturally white skin due to albinism. Kids used to
  mock her when she was much younger. Now grown into a beautiful adult,
  she still wonders why people would look at her differently. Using her
  physical trait to her advantage, she would find and charm her people
  into joining her cause.

## Locations

- A small city/town has been turned into a commune, taking inspiration
  from Diliman Commune, but learning from its mistakes. All its entry
  and exit points have concrete bollards that only allow human-powered
  modes of transpo, like [bikes](/bike), push-carts, wheelchairs.
- RESENTMENT FACILITY: A place where parties settle their differences,
  mediated by a trusted third-party facilitator from within the
  community.

## World design and building

- 90s aesthetics in many things, if not everything
- a ecofascist (?) cult whose god is a centaur: body of a deer (visayan deer), with its "head" being a torso of a man, his left arm is a living balete, twice as long and twice the girth of the other human arm. The cult dares not name their god lest they offend him. He was a former human, sacrificed along with a deer, to the gods by burning to prevent foreign warmongers from invading their land.
