People are inclined to create a mythology around loved ones who are
dead, and these stories, in my experience, are getting harder to vet the
more the time passes. On one hand, I get it, of course---we want to
respect the dead by mostly associating them with good memories.

I'm left with patina'd golden idols on pedestals,
all of which I can't talk to nor question to know them on a deeper
level.

I wonder how it would be like to know them through my own lens; and why
the hell am I always late in meeting the (seemingly?) cool people before
they died. I also wonder---and this sounds egotistical---if I would get
to that level where people in the future would feel bad for not having
met me before I die, the same way I feel for these deceased loved ones.
