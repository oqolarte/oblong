Access to internet is important in this age of information,
but do we have the necessary infra for it to be accessible to everyone,
no matter the social status?

Consider this: students without internet access are at
[risk of educational lag](/pedagogy),
especially when [educational institutions](/academy) embed more of
learning resources online, usually behind paywall.
It doesn't help that our physical public libraries are not well-funded
to keep up with the learning demand.

Internet access should be universal, equitable, and non-discriminatory,
not a commodity to be bought and sold for profit.

Now, internet, at its core, means a [network of computers](/network) on a global
scale, which uses the internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to communicate
between networks and devices.

Traditional networks are called on-premise networks, which means that
all of the devices used for network operations are kept at a physical
location owned by the company, like in an office building, for example.

## Cloud [Computing]

The "Cloud" is just the internet served using other people's---really,
companies', like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta---computers and
proprietary infrastructure.

Cloud computing is the practice of using remote servers, applications,
and network services that are hosted on the internet instead of on local
physical devices.

A cloud service provider (CSP) is a company that offers cloud computing
services. These companies own large data centers in locations around the
globe that house millions of servers. Data centers provide technology
services, such as storage, and compute at such a large scale that they
can sell their services to other companies for a fee. Companies can pay
for the storage and services they need and consume them through the
CSP’s application programming interface (API) or web console.

### CSP services

**Software as a service (SaaS)** refers to software suites operated by
the CSP that a company can use remotely without hosting the software.

**Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)** refers to the use of virtual
computer components offered by the CSP. These include virtual containers
and storage that are configured remotely through the CSP’s API or web
console. Cloud-compute and storage services can be used to operate
existing applications and other technology workloads without significant
modifications. Existing applications can be modified to take advantage
of the availability, performance, and security features that are unique
to cloud provider services.

**Platform as a service (PaaS)** refers to tools that application
developers can use to design custom applications for their company.
Custom applications are designed and accessed in the cloud and used for
a company’s specific business needs.

### Benefits of cloud computing to businesses

1. Reliability: allows employees and customers to access the resources
   they need consistently and with minimal interruption.
2. Cost: because CSPs have large data centers, they are able to offer
   virtual devices and services at a fraction of the cost required for
   companies to install, patch, upgrade, and manage the components and
   software themselves.
3. Scalability: allows flexibility of businesses to consume and avail
   services offered by CSPs in an elastic utility model as needed. This
   means that availing cloud computing services reduces the risk of
   unnecessary cost buy only paying for what they need when they need
   it.
