As of 2022, CISSP ([Certified Information Systems Security Professional](https://www.isc2.org/certifications/cissp)), a globally
recognized [information security](/infosec) certification, has defined eight domains
to organize the work of [security](/security) professionals.
Security teams use them to organize daily tasks and
identify gaps in security that could cause negative consequences for
an organization, and to establish their security posture.
Security posture refers to an organization's ability to manage
its defense of critical assets and data and react to change. 

## Domains

1. Security and Risk Management
2. Asset Security
3. Security Architecture and Engineering
4. Communication and Network Security
5. Identity and Access Management (IAM)
6. Security Assessment and Testing
7. Security Operations
8. Software Development Security

### Security and Risk Management

Defines security goals and objectives,
risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and the law.

Security goals and objectives
: organizations can reduce risks to critical assets and data
like PII, or personally identifiable information.

Risk mitigation
: having the right procedures and rules
in place to quickly reduce the impact of a risk like a breach

Compliance
: the primary method used to develop an organization's internal
security policies, regulatory requirements, and independent standards.

Businness continuity
: relates to an organization's ability to maintain
their everyday productivity by establishing risk disaster recovery plans.

Law, legal regulations
: means following rules and expectations for
ethical behavior to minimize negligence, abuse, or fraud. 

This domain addresses [social engineering](/social-engineering) attacks.

### Asset Security

Secures digital and physical assets.
It's also related to the storage, maintenance, retention, and
destruction of data.

This domain addresses physical attacks like malicious USB cable, card
cloning and skimming.

### Security Architecture and Engineering

Optimizes data security by ensuring effective tools,
systems, and processes are in place.

One of the core concepts of secure design architecture is shared
responsibility. Shared responsibility means that all individuals within
an organization take an active role in lowering risk and maintaining
both physical and virtual security. 

### Communication and Network Security

Manage and secure physical networks and wireless communications.

In the COVID era of remote, hybrid, and on-site work, ensuring that data
remains secure is a challenge to implement across these various types of
work setups.

Addresses password (brute force, rainbow table) attacks, as well as
cryptographic attacks.

### Identity and Access Management (IAM)

Keeps data secure, by
ensuring users follow established policies
to control and manage physical assets,
like office spaces, and
logical assets, such as networks and applications.

4 components of IAM:

- Identification: user verifies who they are by providing a user name,
  an access card, or biometric data such as a fingerprint.
- Authentication is the verification process to prove a person's
  identity, such as entering a password or PIN.
- Authorization takes place after a user's identity has been confirmed
  and relates to their level of access, which depends on the role in the
  organization.
- Accountability refers to monitoring and recording user actions, like
  login attempts, to prove systems and data are used properly.

### Security Assessment and Testing

Conducts security control testing,
collecting and analyzing data, and conducting
security audits to monitor for
risks, threats, and vulnerabilities.

### Security Operations

Conducts
investigations and implementing preventive measures.

### Software Development Security

Uses secure coding practices,
which are a set of recommended guidelines that are used
to create secure applications and services.

Security must be incorporated into each element of the software
development life cycle, from design and development to testing and
release. To achieve security, the software development process must have
security in mind at each step. Security cannot be an afterthought.
