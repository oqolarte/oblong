## Brief review of *Braiding Sweetgrass*

Robin Wall Kimmerer offers Indigenous wisdom that I feel I would not
have found elsewhere, because "elsewhere" are usually full of modern
ideas that are not only not receptive tie ancient lessons but actively
deletes them from collective memory. She remains aware of how Indigenous
wisdom brings humanity back to Western science, and her grafting them
together grows into a new, more grounded knowledge that is, I believe,
fitting to be timeless. Kimmerer weaves words like a wise *tita*
(auntie) that everybody listens to.

## Losing sleep

My body is currently going through a wonky sleep cycle. Most days, I
wake up not feeling fully rested. I just need a good sleep.

A good sleep would mean NOT dreaming of peering into the casket of a
dead relative, and finding him untouched by any decay many weeks after
his death.

A good sleep would feel like I am in a staycation somewhere
with good view.

A good sleep would NOT be happening if I were fucking smashed from the
night before. But it could happen on the following night after my body
has fully metabolized all the alcohol, lol.

A good sleep would mean NOT letting my mind latch into an idea as
spirals and twines on its own in the middle of the night, although it
requires focus.
