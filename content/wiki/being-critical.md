Participating in society while being critical of aspects of it is not
hypocrisy. When we free ourselves from the harmful traditions of
culture, [religion](/religion), and other big concepts used to oppress people, we can
begin [helping others](/mutual-aid) pursue their path to
[education](/pedagogy) and [personal development](/personal-principles).

Remember, there's nothing dangerous about reading something
that's wrong. If your beliefs cannot survive other perspectives, it's
time for new beliefs.
