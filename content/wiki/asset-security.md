Asset
: is an item perceived as having value to an organization.

Threat
: is any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets.
An *intentional* threat might be a malicious hacker who gains access to
sensitive information by targeting a misconfigured application. An
*unintentional* threat might be an employee who holds the door open for
an unknown person and grants them access to a restricted area.

Vulnerability
: is a weakness that can be exploited by a threat.
A *technical* vulnerability can be misconfigured software that might
give an unauthorized person access to important data. A *human*
vulnerability can be a forgetful employee who loses their access card in
a parking lot.

## [Security](/security) starts with asset classification.

Asset management
: is the process of tracking assets and the risks that affect them.
One can only protect what one knows what one has.

Asset inventory
: is a catalog of assets that need to be protected.

Asset classification
: is the practice of labeling assets based on sensitivity and importance
to an organization. This means knowing **what you have**, **where it
is**, **who owns it**, and **how important it is**.

### Levels of asset classification

- **Public**: are assets that have no negative consequences to the
  organization if they are released.
- **Internal-only**: describes assets that are available to employees
  and business partners.
- **Confidential**: refers to assets whose disclosure may lead to a
  significant negative impact on an organization.
- **Restricted**: is reserved for highly sensitive assets, like
  need-to-know information.

### Challenges of classifying information

Identifying the owner of certain assets is straightforward, like the
owner of a building. Other types of assets can be trickier to identify.
This is especially true when it comes to information.

For example, a business might issue a laptop to one of its employees to
allow them to work remotely. You might assume the business is the asset
owner in this situation. But, what if the employee uses the laptop for
personal matters, like storing their photos?

Ownership is just one characteristic that makes classifying information
a challenge. Another concern is that information can have multiple
classification values at the same time. For example, consider a letter
addressed to you in the mail. The letter contains some public
information that’s okay to share, like your name. It also contains
fairly confidential pieces of information that you’d rather only be
available to certain people, like your address.
