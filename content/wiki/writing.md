I like writing, and I intend to get better at it.

## Intro

Writing allows me to shape my thoughts better, either by formalizing
them, or by structuring them for others. It's a stress test to see if
certain ideas can connect well, if at all, and if the end result would
be of any use to you and/or the readers.

## Write compelling headlines, not clickbaits.

Especially in non-fiction communication,
the headline should have the most relevant information;
this is what the readers will see first.

## [How to Write in the Age of Distraction](http://www.locusmag.com/Features/2009/01/cory-doctorow-writing-in-age-of.html)

- Have a short, regular work schedule
- Leave yourself a rough edge. Stop when you hit your daily word-goal,
  especially if it's mid sentence. When you pick it up next day, you'll
  have the prompt you need.
- Don't research. Getting factual all the time gets in the way of
  writing.
- Don't be ceremonious. The perfect setup and/or writing environment is
  nonexistent. So just try to do with what you have.
- Kill your word-processor. Write in plaintext using text editors like
  vi (or [vim](/vim) or neovim), emacs, notepad, textedit, etc.
- Realtime communications tools are deadly. They are distractions. Have
  a schedule for them.

## Technical writing

1. Limit, or avoid, adverbs.
2. Avoid weasel words,
which are phrases or words that may sound good but add no meaning.
Common examples:
    - various
    - a number of
    - fairly
    - quite
    - interestingly
    - surprisingly
    - remarkably
    - clearly
    - several
    - exceedingly
    - many
    - most
    - few
    - vast
    - very
3. Active voice knows who the agent acting,
and promotes clearer meaning.

## Business writing

Cover letter isn't necessarily required,
but when it is,
it can be in 4 (max 5) sentences.

1. Introduce yourself: "I'm writing to inquire [about the job ad found in ABC]."
2. Brief description of your experience: "I can offer X years of experience in
   ..."
3. Create intrigue and lead them to the resume: "My best qualities can be found
   in the top portion of my resume, attached here."
4. Closing remark: "I welcome the opportunity to talk to you about this or any
   other position in your organization."

## My style and voice as of now

Writing how I speak is not simply my voice. And most of the time, I'm
neither writing business nor technical articles. I write, first and
foremost, for myself---playfully sometimes, unusual. It becomes a
balancing act of enjoying the craft and making sure I use the right
words that convey exactly what I need to for the reader, even if the
reader is just Future Me.

## Some more principles to live by

1. [Take care of your body](/health). Mental output is directly
   correlated to one's physical well-being.
2. Have your own work space. Both a distraction-free physical and mental
   space helps.
3. Collect inspiration. Start by reading everything.
4. Leave space for daydreaming. Allow yourself to look inward, to audit
   the mental inventory, to think about thinking even.

## Getting feedback using CRIBS

I found the [CRIBS formula](https://perell.com/note/cribs-my-writing-feedback-formula/) via David Parell.

The acronym stands for: confusing, repeated, interesting, boring,
surprising.

1. **Confusing**: Replace any confusing words or phrases that everybody
   understands. Or, clarify ideas by simplifying and/or giving more
   examples.
2. **Repeated**: Remove repeating parts.
3. **Interesting**: Elaborate on your interesting ideas so that readers
   will stick around.
4. **Boring**: Remove boring ideas, or rewrite boring deliveries of ideas.
5. **Surprising**: Remove parts that contain no surprise. Build suspense
   before every surprise.
