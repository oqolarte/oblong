## On Beliefs

It's important to talk to friends and family---at least,
those closest to you---about things they believe in.
Not only does this open for a lot of interesting discussions,
it also shows how willing you'd be to engage in their ideas
that don't necessary align with yours.

Of course, not everyone has the capacity to hold such space.
This mental bandwidth needs to be acknowledged at all times,
especially when talking about heavy topics.

For me, though, it's a great way of knowing the people in your closest circles.
Perhaps in getting to know them deeply,
you get to know more a bit about yourself and your beliefs.

## Gatecrashing a Party, Almost

For my mother's birthday,
my sibling and a couple of friends and relatives,
decided last minute that we would travel to her to
Guimba, Nueva Ecija,
some ~120 kilometers outside of Metro Manila.

It was so sudden,
but since the opportunity presented itself,
our collective consciousness leaned towards going.

I like seeing the roller-coaster of emotions on my mother's face,
but most of all, I love seeing her happy that we're there for her
on her birthday,
despite the challenges of the commute.
