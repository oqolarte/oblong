It's when rich people decide to become ethical,
and then fly in philosophers in business class
to tell them how to be so.
They'll also hire researchers how to be "efficient" about it.

Wait, that can't be it, right?

We can distill effective altruism (EA) to movement that advocates for making
rational, evidence-based decisions to do the most good possible. Sounds
good in theory, until its proponents stop questioning the systems that
enable money to be the both the solution and the problem it creates.

EA, at its core, is just charity, subtly laced with colonialism and/or
white savior complex. I prefer [mutual aid](/mutual-aid)
over charity. EA works with data, and while data in itself can be
useful, [radical change](/revolution) can never be dependent on nor fit
any kind of human-made metric.
