## Introduction

Nature is the first open source we encounter. Its generosity extends to
all. Indigenous Peoples take part with the animals
and plants in this ecological mutual aid. But many of us have
divorced from this exchange in favor of modernity. The Empire of growth,
conquest, and profit, unfortunately, rewards destructive behaviors.

We clear forests for concrete jungles, only to fail to maintain them.

We dig big holes on the ground and displace communities to mine
metals for our electronics, only to let them collect dust.

We hoard Nature's abundance for ourselves, inspiring only envy.

This project, in three interlinked parts, opposes all these.

## PART 1: QR code as constructive vandalism

As mosaic art, I will install black-and-white grid of ceramic
tiles, designed to look and function as a QR code, to cover potholes on
poorly maintained sidewalks.

By-passers can also scan the QR-code art, or *Q-art code*, using their
smartphone, which contains a link to a website. See Part 2 for details.

Installations will be in at least four cities nationwide.

## PART 2: "Libreng Computer" Website

I will design and put up a website, to be called "Libreng Computer" for
the following main reasons:

1. It will be the gateway where people, specifically students, have a chance to get a free laptop, whose operating system (OS) and
   applications will be free and open source software (FOSS), AKA
   ["libre" software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software),
   respecting user's freedoms.
2. It will not be hosted in social media platforms, away from data
   harvesting of big tech companies and data brokers that profit off of
   our attention and personal data. Instead, I foresee the website's URL
   spreading organically.
3. It will not have deceptive patterns that pervade in and around the
   internet these days. There will be no ads, no analytics, no trackers,
   no use of generative AI.

The main call-to-action is a link to a questionnaire, to be hosted in
[Cryptpad](https://cryptpad.org/) (*not* in Google Forms). Students
who want to avail free laptop must fill out this form.

### Questionnaire/screener in CryptPad

Applicants will be screened via the questionnaire hosted in Cryptpad, an
alternative cloud-based office suite.

The questionnaire will be designed so it screens for people
whether they are:

- 18 years old and above;
- currently enrolled in a school or university as a student;
- currently lacks the financial capacity to obtain their own working
  laptop
- tech-savvy enough to know how to use a laptop and navigate the
  internet

Applicants may be asked to provide proof for some or all of the above
metrics, like a valid ID, current electric bill, etc.

Screened applicants will then be interviewed either in person, via video
call, or over email correspondence, depending on budget and
availability, as the final screening phase.

Once selected, I will share the transcription of the interviews in the
website as a blog post.

## PART 3: Giveaway of refurbished laptops for students in need

Instead of gathering dust or sending them to landfill, why not
give old laptops to students in need?

### Hardware

Each laptop will be bought second-hand from sellers in Carousell. I have
only good experience in that platform, and so I choose it over Facebook
Marketplace.

Any parts that need to be added or replaced will be sourced brand
new to ensure reliability.

For laptops, I choose Thinkpads, specifically the
models T440, T450, or T460. Thinkpads are known for their ease of
repairability, upgradeability, and overall reliability. I have
refurbished a few Thinkpads myself already, so I can attest to these.

List of possible upgrades and add-ons:
- RAM: 16GB
- Hard drive: Replace with 256GB SSD
- mouse and mouse pad
- laptop bag or sleeve

Having said that, I aim to refurbish **four laptops** for this project,
preferably in different locations.

### Software

I echo my belief in FOSS here. We need to start moving
away from the big techs' platforms and products when and where we can.

The laptop's OS
will be replaced with [Fedora Linux](https://fedoraproject.org/kde/),
a free and private OS alternative to the Microsoft Windows.
Its user interface and alternative apps will be familiar to a Windows-user.

### Honor-based

This will be an honor-based mutual aid effort. Aside from the screening
process, I won't be making further verification after each laptop is
"awarded."

## PART 4: Project Documentation

I find it more useful to share knowledge and insight with the public.
The internet is the best medium to facilitate this.

I intend to document the whole process
of this project in my already up-and-running website:

https://ohio.araw.xyz/project

## Moving forward

This project will run for as long as possible on a mutual aid basis.
As in Nature, everyone thrives when everyone joins in the maintenance of
ecosystems. This *performance art* (if you will) tries to achieve that.
We can do our part to empower each other in ways that need not be at the
expense of our environment.
