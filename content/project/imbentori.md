It may or may not have been obvious,
but people my age like to express themselves on the internet.

I was active on Tumblr, that you can still visit:

**[Imbentori](https://iooare.tumblr.com)**

A little while back, I even thought of parsing through the original text I have there, and publish them in some sort of a book...

I'm not throwing this idea permanently away.
It's just that I have more interesting things to tackle, in my opinion.

In the meantime, read the preface I drafted some time ago for this would-be collection of personal essays.

{{< toc >}}

## Preface

The tongue that swirls with its perceived languages can only cope so much from the demands of diction.
*Imbentori*, then, attempts to speak the library of tensions as they never unfold in the mind,
to glue incoherent rants with in/formal grammar & syntax to make it sound
ir/rational.
It is a list of personal truths told with cryptic lingo
(or with International Art English[^bs], one could argue)
to add dimension to the mundane.


I wanted to tell stories, fiction or otherwise, that had shaped me definitively.
In some entries, though, there's no room for interpretation.
In any case, if you feel like the stream of thoughts challenge the way you read, *hmm*, then it's purpose didn't go off tangent.

"Which is what, exactly?" I hear you ask.

"Well," I mutter, racking my brain for *proper* wording.
"The intention of sharing this version of
my Youth---captured between 2012 and 2018---is to offer a perspective of someone who both despises the world,
yet remains hopeful of the people's capacity to kick-start a change, although they bore me at that."
And then you plop back on your chair, still unsatisfied with my ambiguous response.

You will notice quirks.
One of the most notable was how I refuse to capitalize letters that needed capitalization.
It's style;
you'll get over it.

It's tempting to edit away all the cringe parts,
but I think those parts are what makes this body of work,
if you can call it that,
unique.
Right now, I'll compromise by trimming *some* of the bad stuff.

If everything sounds strange,
it's because I had been in this odd phase.

### There's a free copy online

Most of them are lumped into what I call [Unscholarly Notes](https://iooare.tumblr.com/tagged/unscholarly%20notes),
after a chapter in one of my favorite books by F. Sionil Jose.

[^bs]: Reminds me of a paper called [_"Bullshit Makes The Art Grow Profounder"_](http://journal.sjdm.org/19/190712/jdm190712.html) (Turpin et. al., 2019). 
Some 20(20) years ago when I last visited an art museum (or was it just gallery?), 
I couldn't help but roll my eyes on a lot of pieces' description cards that seemingly always include how the artist "explores" this or that.

## Selected Entries

The following are the entries that I like, with slight edits.

{{< btt >}}
### Entry # 1
Date: Wed, 30 Oct 2013

Someone called me on the phone, but I didn't hear it
immediately, because I was too absorbed on the gyrating sound waves
coming out of the speakers. 
My music, Queen, was too loud, and the
speakers are of the modern tech, 
so that they don't do that magical
feedback every time a call or a text comes in my phone. 

You all know that, right? 
A few years back, speakers screech when a phone nearby
would receive something. 
Nowadays, they don't. 
They have killed the
magic.

I picked up the phone. The voice at the other end was raspy but *clear*.
It was one of the mistresses of the former landlord of the community
where I live in now. She said she was coming to pick up some of her old
clothes and to drop a few other things.

There are visitors who seemed wanting to stay, but I can't allow that. I
want to be at my own now, see what will happen. If she comes, and she
stays, and she waits for the landlord, the two of them will lock
themselves in their old room where they will make love for the rest of
the day. Why can't they just leave me in peace?

{{< btt >}}
### Entry # 2
Date: Wed, 30 Oct 2013

Dear diary, today I watched more videos of people fucking each other. I
think it's called pornography or erotica, but it depends on the grade of
steam which confutes any discrepancy between the two.

These people surprised me with their whines. 
I don't get it. 
Am I
supposed to touch my genitals just to emulate what they were
experiencing? 
There was an order of preference that I have read
somewhere, 
but my not remembering when and where I found such an article
proves how sleazy can I be. 
What I know is that, I must do *it* with one
or more persons, but with whom?

I clicked on a panel that played a video of two girls shamed by an
"ex-convict" on an absurd level, 
and he got to ram his penis down their
throats for more than four minutes. 
It was moving like a piston. 
I felt
nervous for these people who have nothing
but their blessed bodies. 
Maybe this isn't entertainment but something
inhumane that feeds off the carnal desires. 
If I must really think about
it, I suppose it was not their choice to participate in such a graphic
scenario.

Sex workers puzzle me. I know I have no right to question their deeds,
but still, the nature of their work is beyond my comprehension. I feel
so dumb saying that.

Dear diary, I am lonely. 
I want to fight off the urge. 
I want to spend
the rest of the week cuddling in someone's arms. 
I don't need to take
cold baths, because life isn't a big porcelain bath tub, 
nor a playlist
of fetishes.

{{< btt >}}
### Entry # 3
Date: Thu, 31 Oct 2013

On moments that I look out of the window, I see the glorious sky.
Everything is modernized. 
Everything looks hopeful, yet ugly, but only
if you looked long enough to see the details. 

{{< btt >}}
### Entry # 4
Date: Thu, 31 Oct 2013

I wish I could cough up wonderful lyrics and come up with good guitar
chords to go with it. 

I wish to do a thousand tough push-ups for every mistake I make. 
That
way, I would be strong enough to endure future errors.

I wish to rebuild the walls I destroyed in order to get here, but it
seems that it's all too late now. 
Someone out there knows why.

{{< btt >}}
### Entry # 5 
Date: Fri, 01 Nov 2013

People from the suburbs have vacated the other room. 
It is free from
dirt now. 
They have also cleaned it. 
Got rid of the pests that might
want to scurry about the floor. 
I am glad the room is all mine now.

The room lacks decorations and soft pillows. 
It would echo in here. 
It lacks inspiration, but it has me now. 
And now, I have it.

{{< btt >}}
### Entry # 6
Date: Fri, 01 Nov 2013

Kill me not with admiration, and tell me I am the best person to have
entered your life ever. 
My guitar strings ache to be strummed, 
my boxes of mementos long to be remembered, but I don't care about them. 
I care about you. 

You who have brought yourself to your own knees. You whose
ponytail I held in place just so you could mourn and bow down before me.
I could set up a room for the two of us where we could strangle the milk
of life out of each other, but you chose to be free. 
And to be honest, that was your only option.

You chose to be with
your cats and your boy friends. 
I had nothing to do with them, so I, in
turn, chose to set you free, even if I wanted otherwise.

{{< btt >}}
### Entry # 7
Date: Fri, 01 Nov 2013

My grandfather, who looked like Quezon, 
once belonged to a guerrilla force. 
They lived in the mountain
side, just like any other rebellion at the time. They boiled unripe
corncobs and cow bones they stole from the farms nearby for lunch. 
They
were outlaws. 
They wanted to throw the Japanese out of the country,
only that they failed to do so. 

Theirs were the stories of war against
alien adversaries who were more powerful. 
They were simpletons turned
militia who knew only a few things about war. 
If they wanted so bad to be an active threat to their opponents, they could
have constructed at least one smart plot. 
But they preferred to be
cowards hidden behind ferns and rocks.

He died at the age of 80. 
Everybody prayed their own versions of
lamentations at his funeral. 
I was not there. 
I did not even see him during his last moments, so damn me now. 

My mother regularly reminds us of her admiration for her father. 
In her own words,
he was the greatest man who lived. 
She told me how her mother
wept during the funeral, so much so that they laughed at her, 
saying she was
over-reacting.

{{< btt >}}
### Entry # 8
Date: Sat, 02 Nov 2013

To the brother whose downfall is inevitable,

Your woman talked to me the other night, but I was not listening carefully. 
Did she say that you were destroyed by an old lady? 
That you broke into tears inside a taxi, because none of your
schemes worked out?

Old hags do tend to cause that.
Sometimes, they are too old for
emotions that they can't even handle themselves. 
They resort to a
so-called systematic deity whom they worship as much as they worship
their laundry. 
It is all helpless now. 

For you and for her, the old
widow.

The sparrows will soon take her and all of her possessions away. 
The last air she will breathe looms nigh before her.

{{< btt >}}
### Entry # 9
Date: Sun, 03 Nov 2013

I can't promise not to be so anxious about the impermeability of jagged
things here in this wanton city, here in this side of the world. 
I can
lock myself up in a room with venomous dingoes and snapping Venus
flytraps, but tell me, can I really lock myself up in a room with
deranged weirdos? 
I cannot be the spark of some other lame people's thoughts. 
I, too, am suffering. 
I cannot be of some help to others, sorry about that.

Some other night, I was not thinking straight again. 
I think I was
capable of horrendous crimes that time. 
So instead of losing it, I got
myself jacked in the computer and played all of the piano concertos
repetitively, until I came back to my senses, and everything seemed
wonderful again.

{{< btt >}}
### Entry # 10 
Date: Mon, 04 Nov 2013

Let it sit there in the mellow light. 
And let it be clear to you that it
is not yours, that thing. 
This is not a race that you could just break
into a run like you are going to make it to the finish line. 
If you run now, you will not make it. 
The finish line is only a perceived idea
through which we wish to project the kind of reality we wanted, the
goals we wish to get. 

So hear me out on this, and just let the thing sit
by itself. 
It is safely locked in here. 
The room is all
so-and-so-proof---nothing
goes in or out. 
Entirely vacuum sealed.

Now, step out of the room and close the door behind you. 

Good.

Listen to me. 
It is the pride in us that will bleed us to death. 
You are not owned by your pride. 
And you need to rack your brains if you
have to, just so you will remember that. 
If you have to jot these down,
do it, for tomorrow and the day after that and so on, there will be
difficult exams. Life is a practical test.

{{< btt >}}
### Entry # 11
Date: Tue, 05 Nov 2013

Regardless of the hours of rest I give myself,
this quake in
my chest still would not die down.
My heart thrashes for no romantic reason.
And during its convulsive moments, I feel this fear might consume me.
Later this day, I might trace my steps
back into the previous night to see what I have done to feel so gutted
and spooked, although I highly doubt it would be of any help.

{{< btt >}}
### Entry # 12
Date: Thu, 07 Nov 2013

On a night with the least expectations, 
someone might want to show up by the front gate. 
She could be a friend, her derelict vehicle behind her, 
engine vibrating in anticipation of a long senseless drive.

She might want to invite me in her car, and ask for advice: 
about how she was so doped that her mother found out;
about the terrible travails that almost diminished her mind to dementia.

I might say, "Get us out of here first." 
The tires would then screech. 

I might tell someone to go to the nearest bridge, 
preferably at least a mile long, 
and there we might just drive back and forth. 
But the bridge would not respond to such foolish actions. 

She might get tired of driving and just take me to her room instead.

Of course, no one will actually show up and demand my presence. 
None of this will ever happen.

{{< btt >}}
### Entry # 13
Date: Thu, 07 Nov 2013

On several facets of human frailty that I fail to tamper with logic, 
a deep resentment in discussing them prevails. 
Is it because human that I am, that in order to function normally, 
I have to act as if my weaknesses are repulsive topics? 
But isn't that denial, enough a reason to be asking for psychiatric help? 

Well, I don't need help.
I'm doing good with my dull, simple life,
thank you very much.

{{< btt >}}
### Entry # 14
Date: Sun, 10 Nov 2013

Gentlemen can't rack their brains.
Ladies won't do it for them.
The might has been passed back and forth, so that one day, no one will be
needing the other. 
We might all become asexual, and the only terrible
thing about that is not finding enough limbs to stimulate the genitals.

{{< btt >}}
### Entry # 15: *the response to any dream is its own ending*
Date: Tue, 12 Nov 2013

I ask now for the wisdom of people hearing me out about this one
~~tiny~~ bit (Yes, my dead grandfather, you are one of them, so please
stop brushing my shoulder with your phantom hands.):

*TO DREAM* of someone every single night when the clock strikes nine at
the fall of all the bass with the banging in unison of all buttheads to
the tune of all that has collapsed and will be collapsing with an
angelic choir from the ripped-open heavens apart *IS* normal as long as
it does not leave me grasping for breath, right? 
My dreams are made of
sad stuff. 
When I wake up from one, I put a pillow between my legs and
hug another with my arms, because it's all I have. 
A bunch of
un-talkative pillows, all heat-less and disappointingly foamy. 
They have
phased out the feathery once. 
Too many geese and ducklings and mallards
had suffered.

I saw once a meme somewhere, asking what if the pillows recorded our
dreams and all we had to do is plug them to our computers in the morning
to see our them, if any, again.
Are they that stupid to not know that
all dreams have no substantial beginnings? 
Only endings.
Sometimes good,
but most of them just stop abruptly.

Once upon a time, I had many dreams of this particular person who
stopped jamming with me all of a sudden---and that is fine.
Maybe she
dreamed of other persons, too, who would be genuinely interested in the
good stuff of pop music she liked. My sister, upon witnessing me looking
so badly wrecked, decided one day to teach me a lesson on how to deal
with the feminine intricacy:
Snap out of it.

{{< btt >}}
### Entry # 16
Date: Tue, 12 Nov 2013

Science never told us that deeply ingrained within the cosmic particles
the earth was made up of, are so much drudgery that when the godly forces
of Universe swirled it all up into a gargantuan sphere, 
the amalgam was
but a place abundant of disappointment. 
Disappointment that, if served
frequently in many a cold dose, will dissolve human faith.
Thus,
it isolates a person in a barren phenomena, a distant sanctuary of the
inner self, sometimes called madness.

{{< btt >}}
### Entry # 17
Date: Wed, 13 Nov 2013

The roads that branch out to those distant havens are all awfully
pungent like rotten onion. 
So here's a useless lifehack: 
Be skeptical of
maps with X's on them, 
simply because they are stupid and do not belong
in this time and age. 
Only ancient topography had these large red marks on them.
They were created by humans for humans as imaginary goals with
no evident rewards, 
so they could feel free to be objective, 
be freed
from their doubts of existence, 
be ambitious despite the dull Sundays.
What use really is there of a map? The long roads are boring and tiring;
the short ones are swift and tasteless.

After thousands of years of improving technology, we still find
ourselves stuck and deserted in a different dimension.

{{< btt >}}
### Entry # 18
Date: Wed, 13 Nov 2013

Despite the miseries the kid had gone through,
he managed to salvage
his childhood by talking to a toy.
He is his own true friend.
A bond was naturally formed between him and Himself,
idealistically unbreakable even at the toughest times.
He was seldom seen crying simply because he was seldom seen at all.
When he was locking himself up in his room, who knows what things he was doing there,
the miracles enchanting him there.
People were worried, but only because they don't understand.
And those who do never had enough time to pay him a visit.

The kid was bright, I must say.
He learned that people do not always see the world as he sees it,
and that it is his duty to understand them.

The sores still burn him throughout the years, but now he's too tough
for them. In fact, his toughness is so much for him to handle that it
grows out as patches of facial hair and untrimmed nails and
badly-attended hygiene. The sores itch him somewhere just above the
chest, but he's become tolerant now.

{{< btt >}}
### Entry # 19
Date: Thu, 14 Nov 2013

I was pushing myself, tapping at the frontal lobes, hoping
to remember something they taught me almost twelve hours ago. I was the
new guy, one who gives the glass around a
circle of conversationalists.
We all drank the glass full of poison.

Laps later, talk got better.
At that time, I munched on meat served on the table when this scourge
started boiling in my stomach. The potion I had been passing around
betrayed me; the friend became the repulsive
adversary. In a blink, I was in the bathroom, throwing up.
The liquid rushing through the throat and nasal cavity made
painful spasms. Vomit dripped on my lips and in my nostrils.
I felt weak.

This guy on the mirror squinted his eyes at me.
He looked desolated and trapped. Too, he looked cool in that Joker shirt.
Next time I see him, I'd take him out into the real world.

I cleaned up my mess.
Peed after that. Went out and found my cousin waiting by the restroom door,
asking if I were still doing good.
I nodded and smiled and went to bed.

I try to recall what they told me, but all of those went with the gastric pulp down the reservoir of rejected principles (called toilet).

{{< btt >}}
### Entry # 20
Date: Sat, 16 Nov 2013

It has been a long time since I was last aware of my being atop a floor
of some church. Maybe, in recalling it right now, it was the last time I
would ever be in a church, or any holy establishment for that matter.

At first, I was bashful coming out as a cross-breed of agnostic and
atheist, but the more I learned, the more certain I became, that relying
on faith alone would not be smart a strategy if one, such as I, were to
continue living in cussedness.

I dislike the overall ambiguity of it, mainly because of extremists and
militants who distort and/or obscure the truth; although I like the
religious holidays and how they are so good at briefly converting us
into ethical and kind beings, in whatever ways we know how, genuine or
not, before we return to our same old selves. During this
period, we are allowed to vocalize our hopes for humanity with minimal
judgmental feedback. Everybody suddenly can forgiving.
And here and there, lights would appear as adornments of the house, a welcome banner to accommodate
any spirit who would decide to lounge in and share some thoughts.

Some people give too much color to it, though, to a point that my eyes
have had enough of this abject misery. Here we are still with our
dumbness in tact, trying to make something out of nothing. Conjurers we
are not.

{{< btt >}}
### Entry # 21
Date: Tue, 19 Nov 2013

Didn't go to the morning class.
Arrived late on the afternoon class, but it was fine.
The professor decided to not show up, and make us wait in vain instead.
Waited until the last class.

It was the hardest part, waiting.
It always has been.
Waited until my buttocks became sore in sitting.
Waited until my legs deserted my being for standing too long.

Stuck my head out for some colleagues who were playing crossword puzzle on a tablet.
They thanked me every time I got a word right.
Waited for the last class.
The raging current of boredom was made to take me away from the university, but it didn't.

And I waited still. Until the last class.
I was hanging around gay people giving lecture to straight dudes about
homosexuality, and I lingered long enough to hear everything they all
had to say.

I waited until finally, the wait was over.
When I stepped in the last class, a 30-page surprise exam was waiting for me in my desk.
"It's a joke," I thought, almost too loud.
It wasn't a joke. And the last professor for the day did not seem to be in the mood for bad jokes.
In 45 minutes I was done with the whole thing. Whether I took the
exam seriously was out of the question. It's a funny world we live in.
We wait for the wrong things to happen.

{{< btt >}}
### Entry # 22
Date: Wed, 20 Nov 2013

When I think of how dashing I am,
I picture myself lost with the commuters waiting in the train station,
all well-dressed and well-mannered.

When I'm drunk, I dance while I pee.
I draw murals on bathroom tiles with urine,
and on the morning it would smell of ammonia.

I fan an old book on my nose and start sniffing its wasted years of abandonment,
the smell of aging vanilla diffusing profusely from its pages to the
air, renovating my deconstructed thoughts.
I try to record what I'm doing as drafts (not videos) on my phone.

I think I'm hot stuff, sometimes.
I think I'm all glam from head to toe, but it is all feigned.
No need now for brashness; I am fully aware of what I really am,
and it's really not that difficult to see.
I think of mysterious sounds droning somewhere to console me, but all that echoes back is a monotonous buzz.
It's all cheap cologne and thrift store clothes and perforated undergarments;
and the train station is really just a dark alley of bad crimes,
and the commuters are really just rats.
The joints are creaky when they shouldn't be.

I may feel pretty sometimes, but rainbows aren't going to last the whole day.
I'm just like everyone else, trying to be cool.

{{< btt >}}
### Entry # 23
Date: Sat, 23 Nov 2013

Last Wednesday, I was already 30 minutes late for one of my classes,
but I lingered around the corridor, eyeing occasionally the glass door
behind which I should be, waiting for the professor to go out. You see,
almost always does he excuse himself to go out to fetch something. I saw
this as my opportunity to sneak in his class.

Go out he did, only when I least expected it. I fumbled for my phone and
acted to be waiting for something else, and I can only hope that he did
not recognize me as one of his students. I decided to chicken out. I
made up excuses and debated with myself, but in the end, I chickened
out. I was so close. Ridiculously so to have not carried on with this
stupid plan. Being late already means demerits, and not appearing at all
in this important subject only made me sink deeper into my own grave.
The lesson, I hope I know now, is to never back out, not now, not later
or ever.

{{< btt >}}
### Entry # 24
Date: Tue, 26 Nov 2013

none of us could think straight, maybe it's because of
the libido setting in, or the lack of sense of responsibility, or the
vague feeling of abandonment. i don't know. i tried suppressing mine by
drinking lots of chilling fluids from the freezer, but my brain almost
got frozen. so i stopped searching for the things that might cure me of
my disease.

a not-so-close friend admitted she was a bit worried i might
get old faster than her, but i assured her that my gears are not rusty
yet. just three days ago, when i woke up, i did some push-ups. my gears
are not rusty yet. i did two sets of push-ups, five reps each, and i
felt good. but later that day, my shoulder blades started aching. my
pillows are all wet. how is that? my blankets, my bed sheets, my
notebooks, my bag, all wet, each one of them. drenched with gooey
substance. the smell is not evident, but with careful observation, one
can easily deduce that such could only come from the windows of one
abominable soul.

i know what you are thinking. but it *isn't* true. they
say words are powerful, but when they come from a tainted memory, words
can be deceiving. do not be fooled. learn how to read beyond the lines.
when i say my pillows are wet, i could mean my pillows were doused in
nightmarish sweat. think about it.

### Entry # 25: *50 years past bedtime*
Date: Sat, 30 Nov 2013

I will be your only medication when you reach the end of your career.
I will be the palpable, inexplicable aftertaste with which you will want
to harm yourself at the back of your tongue. I will not be toxic,
though. Therefore, there will be no harm. Simply, I will be needed, just
as one needs pills when one is feverish and unhealthy.

Preservation---for it is the old and golden that needs preserving;
instincts and memories flashed pseudo-permanently on films or photographic papers.
Sometimes we think of ourselves as a selfish bunch, but there is more to that.
Thoughts in sarcophagus, mummified, waiting to be unearthed by future
archaeologists.

Hopefully, after I bury these distractions, these murky musings---you, of
course, along with all of it---our descendants would take the time to dig
them up, to debunk the surrounding myths, to suffer from our
recklessness, and to procure among the ruins that glistening wisdom I
assumed to have possessed but never actually had.

I have not yet involved myself in a physically intimate act,
sometimes crudely referred to as *having sex*, with another person.
Fuck me, right?

### Entry # 27: *Kb*
Date: Mon, 02 Dec 2013

Should drunk people go to church? They seem to be passionate about
begging for forgiveness.

I tried to lift myself up from the wooden floor but it's no use. It's
rather a good thing, exceptional even, that near me is a pen and a
notebook. This is written first before I typed it heavily into my hard
drive.

I ask too much forgiveness; I should be a pope or live a celibate life
or someone immune to the temptations of foreign flesh. I will use my
hand. Good thing that is not the case. I guess you were not born for the
likes of me.

When in the morning I wake up, you will still be in my mind. It works
only if you were just as partial to me as am I to you.

I tried writing, but nothing came out of my pen except drools and
spoiled sardines. What does that even mean? I hope you like those who
struggle to formulate proper thoughts from defiled beings, because if
not---too bad.

Instead of a lovely letter, it came out like this. You should've seen my
notebook, how aggressively I scribbled down the lines, not all too
hyperbolic for your taste, but given time, I think they will mean
something to someone someday.

The dog's been chirping the whole night, but how come? Dogs are not
created for this sort of thing. I have wondered enough to think where
you might be in this darkest hour, but I am not myself at this
minute. The likes of me cannot make advances because the likes of
me drop by to say hello a bit too late.

Outside lies an interesting field. Acres of solitary people forming
point circles of commotion. Wanting to be heard or seen or sometimes
left out. Institutions for the misguided, for the zealots, and the
in-betweens. But I prefer Here, breathing comfortably around denizens
unwilling to choke me with their ideals. Here is a good place. Here you
aren't, you weren't, you won't be. Oh the joy of cumulative absence,
whatever it means to you!

### Entry # 29
Date: Wed, 11 Dec 2013

I ask myself if the idea of my mind being attuned to a sweet raspberry
voice I have never heard were reliable, that is, if paying heed to such
would be worth my while. Disconnect a lonely guy from the tranquil
comforts of his zone, and believe me, he will soon be hearing a voice so
lovely he won't believe it is from his own illusory incantations.

Date: Thu, 12 Dec 2013 10:26:32

My monochrome phone rang, and I picked it up. "Hey,"
said the woman on the other line. "Are you free right now?" It took me a
while to recognize the voice. It was, of course, Marian. Psych
grad at 25. Practitioner of an unhealthy lifestyle. Preacher of
poorly executed quips. That Marian.

"Yeah," I said.

Once, she was a cast in my midnight dream, but that was before the
wedding earlier this year. Had I been more receptive, I would have known
her discreet "suggestions" and would have gladly reciprocated her hints.
But marriage does bring out the woman in every girl; Marian knows better
than to gun every young man in the room with her pheromones. She is now
more dedicated to her husband, as she should be.

M and I talked for a while about this party she was inviting me in.
I did not like going to parties, but this was a choice not mine to make.

I dislike family gatherings, as they always end up in political
discussions that I am tired of hearing. Aunts and uncles throw back
and forth the same opinions that I have memorized, but I won't bother
you with the details. We are a mess, you must know that.

Bonifacio died
not because he was a part of the revolution, not because the enemies'
rifles peppered him with bullets. He died because it was an order of the
former leader. Do I think it was a betrayal of sorts? Here I was,
wondering about patriotism on a birthday party.

We are a mess, my kin and I, you must know that. We think deeply in the
dark moments of solitude, but in the wee hours of the morning, we weep
brat-like because we tend to soil our sheets with the crap coming out of
our boring mouths.

After drinking the equivalent of three bottles of beer, I wanted to
sleep off the rest of the night, that I might shut the people out of my
head finally.

Introductions again on the morrow, but not now. I need some snoozing.

It would be nice for me to find you elsewhere, perhaps in a more okay
place than this one. A wretched world where seven billion weirdlings
live never is a good rendezvous for two people, one of whom aspires to
be the ideal fling of the other. Outer Space wouldn't do as well.

The infinite quirks of our daily lives bore the heck of me. Get me out
of such languorous affairs, and let me see you already prepped up for
this simple occasion I am trying to pull you in.

The looks and the sounds and the feels of the people I have been
browsing emotionally tortures me.
The rumor is true: People are more
beautiful on the internet.
About their smarts, though---they vary from person to person.
What is the etiquette, then, when it comes to dealing
with these kinds of humans?
Whatever it is, I just have to make sure
that I am not to be so spooky to them. Ah---

Do not force it, they say. Do not. Do not, and all shall naturally,
smoothly follow.

An old hag I know is into fits of cough lately.
Her dear weak lungs now finally giving up on her.
I would advise her to take her vitamins soon.

An old hag is the wisest crook I know, and if she died in her sleep,
it would be a shame.

And the old hag needs some back rub,
but it's the middle of the night,
and she hates the mere sight of me.
It is not me whom she needs,
but her god.

And her god would talk to her in her dreams, asking her to stop smoking.
"Do it for them," he would say.
But she is such a stubborn woman that
even a divine deity as influential and popular as her god could not convince her.

It is astonishing to find something so repulsive to be so breathtakingly beautiful.
An amateur disease gone viral.
Hers was a daring shot to the skies of blaring cyber-fame.
The magic in her soul is hers to handle,
and for the world to leash.

Love is real.
An invincible arc passing between at least two contacts.
An idea agreed upon.
A painful abstraction of an empty stomach.
An ignorance that could not be vanquished.
A gimmick pulling back the strands of hair to a neat style.
A cheap perfume. A cheap mint.
Strings of used floss. Polished fingernails.
An affection for the outdated minds.
Love is real, but lovers are not.

### Entry # 36: *innumerable pointlessness*
Date: Wed, 18 Dec 2013

1.  Raindrops fell on hot roads. 
Heat from the deepest, most complex of sanatorium was exhumed to the surface.
Heavy clouds trap the vapors.
Everyone was getting agitated as the city melted beneath the sky.
It's physics.
2.  Shards shot out to random directions, away from the crime scene.
The vase had fallen to the floor, and I wondered why.
The shards were everywhere.
And what about the flowers?
It's unfortunate one could not simply reverse the path of every force of every particle that moved.
There is no Rewind Button;
this God did not make the events in the Universe to be reversible.
It's physics.
3.  I wasn't looking when you were talking to me.
Nothing in your speech is interesting.
Because it's about *meta*physics.

### Entry # 37
Date: Thu, 19 Dec 2013

Talk about a lot of things.

Words came out of my mouth, slurry and very much undefined. I had no
good sound to produce, no good thought to mutter, and still I opted to
speak as if it were an obligation. I was told that random conversations
alleviate the pressure inside---a release, a black opening, a tiny hole
where the strangling gasesss would essscape, slithering all the way out.

The buzz I made was a lot, but the anguish in the guts remains. I might
be perpetually strangled.

### Entry # 38
Date: Fri, 20 Dec 2013

Several minutes before midnight, all is burning. All is white with joy
and desire and illustrative rage; and the tremendous heat escaping from
the excited bodies make sudden changes.

Earth has been such a happy place where happy memories are shelved in
boundless rooms. And we have made it that way. Humans are a mass so
optimistic that the illusions of hellish ways of how the world would end
cannot consummate our prospects of having something divine.

The midnight is coming, or has come.
Or has gone.
No one knows for sure.
Time has been distorted by countless corrections and mistakes.
Either we are dying, or already we are dead.

I'm holding you sober. Your sobriety is a blessing, actually, like a
sneeze released violently after being held for so long. Thus, while my
presence is still vivid, I hold you not in solace but in a fiery
excitement. This is not a violation of privacy, not even a vile
stratagem I organized; rather, a celebration of two miscible personas
and the events that might follow.

Sometimes, I would look around, then see your face cranked and distorted
with stress; your nails empty of colors; hair badly done, wanting of
immediate care. I would want to extend a comforting arm, enlist you as
someone deserving of goodness in life that only I could hand out,
administer whatever assistance appropriate; and yet you remain
indefeasible and mighty, even in this blurry world, that I dare not go
near.

I'm holding you as an idol misplace in vain, as I would hold an
expensive wristwatch I can't afford. In reality, I cannot hold you, nor
can I ask you to kindly hike up the skirt and show me a flawed world no
longer knowledgeable of pampering.

### Entry # 40

Sometimes, I wish you could take a five-minute day-off (ha!) from your
skewed visions of screwed-up existence, but I have known the feeling for
so long I cannot help but set up a gig for you to immerse yourself in,
since I cannot convince you to see your life otherwise. It cannot be
silenced easily, I know. It cannot be shushed. I believe, though, that
one day, if you pulled and pushed the oars hard enough, you will
transcend from such a low point in your life, one way or another. Be
dear now, and don't do anything stupid.

I am a freelancer friend.
Everybody's nobody.
The bastard who is somehow successful of winning many a peer by staying neutral,
but is befriended truly by only a few.
I am the embodiment of a grapevine full of
backlashes, backstabbing secrets, and unfinished arguments. Containing
them all is like taming a bull: I can't. But I am a friend of this and a
friend of anti-this, and this is all I have. Good luck with that.

I am the messenger who died in the landmine field, and my lords and
ladies whose anguish I have failed to deliver to their respective
recipients would have desired for me another form of death; however, I
don't wish to inform them my failure, nor do I want a second shot at
retribution.

I am a freelancer friend, but if this did not make sense, it would work
out for me just fine.

I have witnessed how people silently accuse others for their amusement,
but have done nothing against it. I, too, am a perpetrator, and knowing
that that title doesn't offend me offends me. If this did not make
sense, then I know I am doing it right.

I am a freelancer friend, what a hectic job it is.

I am everyone's mailbox of undelivered hate, and if you would just
*please* bash my head with a baseball bat like what jocks do in shitty
movies for fun---

I don't mind goofing around with people who listen to drone tracks
for entertainment, because they're the ones who have interesting
thoughts to share.

I don't mind getting hexed by alpha dogs of my social circle. I've
done a lot of bad things,
and a little curse from them would only serve
as a reminder that I should be doing worse.

I don't mind being missed by some chubby lass who happens to be one of
the peers' leading darlings, even if she's just joking. I don't mind
because I don't believe her. She's just being nice. Sometimes, I would
like to think of myself as immune to such charms, but some charms
develop new kind of strains that pass through my defense system.

I don't mind not fitting anywhere with anyone, because no matter what I
do, there will still be empty slots for me to get in.

I don't mind being unable to patch this wanton bleeding with a remedial
touch, for there will be appropriate hands willing to do that. I'll just
have to hang on and look for them and hope it's not too late.

### Entry # 43: *Things I've Learned in Matabungkay Beach Resort the First Time I Got There*
Date: Wed, 01 Jan 2014

Cousins plan to take me to the faraway hellhole.
I remember the environment as derisive,
making one learn a couple of things:

- Cigarette butts are as ubiquitous as the grey sand.
- Kids invade the beach at day while adults patiently wait for the night.
- Fatty meats are ironically must-haves when celebrating.
- Also alcohol and gambling.
- Forget not thy earplugs. Terrible singers populate the local karaoke hubs, letting loose of their anguish with their hard accents.
- Overlooking the sandy deposits of Matangbukay are lifeguard towers.
They all seem empty, though.
- Derived from the interiors of truck tires are plenty of lifebuoys
(which compensate for the scarcity of lifeguards).
- Everybody wears bikini in this place. Everybody.
- People are not at all loud and rowdy.
At least, that's what I have observed 500 meters away from them.
- To avoid sunburn, avoid the sun.
- Grill everything; die from colon cancer later.
- End your trip by catching a final glimpse of the setting sun.

The meandering eyes possess a certain sharpness that only
age or sickness could defeat. The meteoric pair sweeps
the scenery before relaying any acquired data to a decent brain.
However, they're altogether defamed with detestable comments that often
come from detestable figures, increasingly so that the evening has
become an impatient wait for the dawn.

### Entry # 45: *(i wrote once to a semi-imaginary fling. how stupid.)*
Date: Thu, 02 Jan 2014

In writing this do I realize that your prolonged absence simply cannot
be vanquished by smoke nor stupor. I appeal to you, thus, to redeem me
immediately from the miring transpiration of my existence. Be that
lucent reminder that at least one person is mad enough to console me,
that I am worth the distance from the punitive gags others throw at me.

In reciprocation, I will be at my best behavior.
By this, I mean to hush down my stupidities
and will not be much of a douche most modern persons are.
This will prevent your thoughts from being clouded with
wrong accusations and conclusions.

If, however, things would go out of control,
for such is Nature and all of its components,
from order dissipating to disorder,
then we must accept it.

(Strange for me to say these things about us parting already when we haven't even met yet.)

I must go now, stranger.
My bed invites me to DreamLand;
it shall wane a bit of my impatience,
and halt temporarily the effluvium of my tizzy thoughts of a faraway you.
Take care always.

We are isolated in an inaccessible isle of complexity quitters,
far from where the funerals of social behaviors are.
We have secrets that can astound earthworms and overlords alike
We are not honorifics nor bureaucracies,
but we are capable of vigorous copulation and funny possibilities.
We are so stupidly driven we think we can own our disgusting selves.
We are an asylum of dumb fucks in dusty trunks.
We are a multitude of tragedies.

My eyes now burn as the light effervescing from the monitor steal me away.
I am looking at all the highlights of the human race,
the darkness of the human travail,
every peak and every trough.
I am staring, too, at some faces, those declaring innocence.
Inanimate faces are the only innocent things one can look peacefully at nowadays;
and what a bad-luck-for-the-earth, for they cannot change the world.

Many a night had I perspired in my sleep, the stench would be heavy by
morning. I had to sun them thrice a week to eliminate the odor. But not
anymore. I shall suffer no longer from sweaty nights. Alas! here comes
the monsoon. It reveals the relief: a nourishing surge for the
nonexistent seeds sown in the soiled thoughts of all, delightfully that
it excites those who had grown tired of their dull vacation. A
transition of seasons when peculiar things are deemed okay: again will
bills drop to more affordable rates; wenches in corporal suits will now
be drenched whores in the storm; vehicles will soon float as chunks of
metal lilies on torrents of filth; bastards into sentimental poets. The
rest---they are kids again, and the sour smell from their fermented
armpits has gone.

There have always been clusters of authoritarian behaviors ruining
interpersonal relationships everywhere.
It focuses one's views on a central dogma---the person's
self. As a result of this dread,
imagination becomes the solution to those who are defeated by
the ruthless bossiness.
The key to their internally induced contentment
may lie on daydreaming that peace *has* a chance.
That peace does stand a chance in changing the heartless into philanthropist.

### Entry # 50: *four steps to senselessness and non-misanthropy*
Date: Sun, 05 Jan 2014 12:01:17

1.  Protection before insertion. Diminish as much damage as you can by
    initiating the verification of a thought or an idea before you try
    putting it in a debate with others. It doesn't have to be clean, but
    it must be cleansed.
1.  Allow usage of coins and undeviced dice for the sake of maintaining
    balance. The balance is to be kept horizontal. If it tilts, stop
    throwing up.
1.  Consider also ringing in your head the chances of diabloism. Does it
    divide or unite? Usually, I would suggest strongly the latter, but
    if yours is a non-canonical stance, it's your choice. Just don't
    expect them to hear you out.
1.  And in this mixology of brainiac profusion, I do not wish to astound
    the "elders" who have looked my way. I can offer nothing, not wisdom
    for I am inexperienced, not wits for I have been flunking, not even
    myself for I am nobody; but I could offer a fragment of personhood
    that you maybe familiar with, for I am a human nevertheless, doing
    robotic dance moves for a living.

The sight is flared up to maximum, and one can easily see the radiance
shooting up in geometric spirals. Every time I look, a small part of me
gets injured, as if it had been approved by the whole universe to be so

passing. It's all theoretically acceptable, now that I think of it.

cancelling themselves out, given that each statement is of equal

The most inefficient guy in the bunch was heard chuckling over some
unfunny improv. The cunning in his smile was made not to be infectious.
He uploads what he cannot contain, mulls at what he could; and with this
strategy does he religiously follow himself around the glitchy planes.

I am startled by his need to branch out from the existing norms, and to
just create one that would fit his style. I wish to lend him a hand one
of these days.

### Entry # 55
Date: Tue, 21 Jan 2014

I would like to oversleep some other time outside the house, in urban
caverns beneath cement bridges where slums never bother each other,
except only when asking for some little things. I would like to own
myself for a while.

People would be looking for me, but I would be flat on my stomach,
looking out far beyond the cities, watching the sun sink behind the
buildings, aching and smiling as if they would never know. They might
never hear from me again. I might go somewhere else where their warped
movement I would never hear of. And that would be my moment, in the
shadows, with fetid individuals who remain astonishingly optimistic
despite their ordeals.

I would be hungry most of the time, feel groggy and smell bad, but
that's part of the plan. Restoration never comes easily.

I don't see myself either ill-fated or privileged. I just hang in
here whenever I get the chance to just hang around a bit longer.
I could not help but notice how different people are;
and perhaps it is the right time to start expecting more instead of less,
to learn again the profits of breakage, to harness the prowess
and gather every last bit of
sickness and health.

### Entry # 57

Tried not to be hostile today.
It was difficult.
I've always thought that I'm one of the good guys,
and that most people have lost their grooves,
and that I should ignore their flickering noise.

Then, I remembered something my psychology teacher told me:
"Superiority complex is the worst kind of inferiority complex."
I realize now that it makes sense.

Yes, the wrong people can make the bad things come to life,
make them look better and cleaner.
They direct the waters from the drainage back to the treatment facility,
where all these fluids of all urban creatures are to be chemically infused with some drinkable liquid.
They are wrong in doing so.
But I was also wrong in putting myself several steps ahead of them,
when really, all this time that I have been in the field,
I cautiously look out for my steps, trying to figure out if I might be stepping on something hazardous that would shatter me to pieces,
while everyone is already crossing the finish
lines at the far side of the meadow.

I know this is a phantom exercise difficult to do, but doing it is kind of alleviating.
(I don't think alleviating is the proper term, but there goes.)

I would like to buy my own camera, but I am too impoverished to obtain a new one.
I must rely on my photographic memory for now.

I would like to buy me a new bike, so I can ride down the streets where children bathe and dance in the rain;
but I'm too broke, so I would have to stick to walking.

I would like to buy a new pair of shoes, but then I remembered that updating my wardrobe isn't my thing.
So, I gave up on the idea, wore my worn-out slippers, and walked outside.

I would like for the sun to shine just a little,
that there may be a glimpse of hope waiting behind the clouds.

I remember stepping into the room where our fiery fate had long been waiting.
Inside were common things.
We could have set ourselves ablaze had we been careless,
and "do you hear yourself?" was all that you'd muttered.
Did I answer that, or was I into your dilated eyes then that I was stupefied?
I don't remember.
Remind me of that sometime, do you mind?
Who would have thought that within these white walls we chanted
the same unintelligible syllables that only you and I must know?

### Entry # 60
Date: Sun, 12 Jan 2014

The distant booming of a plane diverted my attention to the
stillness of everything. Apart from the late night lights,
outside was a dark aura that shines gloom over the land,
and a magic called sleep had once been conjured upon those who grew tired of
waiting for the night to fall. And to those who had been either immune
to the curse or too bewildered by the things that had transpired
recently to even dare to sleep, no matter how deviant and diminutive
they were, they're still up. They dug deeper into themselves, finding
who they were at the moment. Some transform, others go mad and wild in
flats without kitchens.

And I---I was here waiting for the hypnosis to
kiss me so that I might finally rest these eyes. Most people were no
longer awake as the curse tapped them. But know this: there was no awakening.
Morning would come again hours from now as it has always,
and the sun would rise still to put an end on the night's sorcery,
and they who had slept through the night would mechanically open their eyes for
themselves or for their families or for that work,
that school; *but* they would never be awake. They might have opened their
eyes, but they would never see again what once was. They would fail to
recognize---as it was in the past---the decaying things in front of
them. All those time they were awake, they really were asleep!

How will I face some new faces of Change, such as yours, if I am still
stuck at the image of your former self, a bright effigy of both
fluffiness and porcelain simplicity, now only a dissolved memorandum of
the past? Your worshipers have followed you still, despite dismembering
your own mane into some sort of a bobcat hairdo, which, I believe, is an
emblem of someone who's up to something worse than bad. Please, tell me
one day, if we must inevitably talk, that this is not the case. Forgive
me if, however, from now on, I'd be dodging your glances. I am not a fan

return to whatever job you paused just so you could mingle with me, I
won't mind, really.

Spending time With myself again somewhere,
wondering if someday our old jokes would make us laugh again.
Our eyes, if they ever meet again, would gleam the same uncomfortable passion.

This world kills me, and I need you to redeem me from myself,
because sometimes, murders pollute the forests inside me.
Perhaps by taking a chance to talk to me about the simplest of things
would calm me down.

You are the beacon present in my daydreaming pastime. A multidimensional
demigoddess of the morning light, present nowhere near me, yet
reachable, if only I wanted to fight traffic for at least two hours. But
even if I traveled that long, I wouldn't be sure if you would even look
my way. I look at the portraits stolen from the entanglement of codes of
your cryptic love blog, and I see me damned to the bones. From the
storms and debris I see you rise and fall, your chest doing the same.
Jet-black shines with great ember, even outshining my wits. I look, and
my eyes become deranged, my tongue blenched and smoked with the same
coyness you are invigorated with.

The people who have touched you in any way are social alphas, but I
cannot look up to them, because they wanted nothing but to hear you
grunt some dumb syllables. This I cannot change. I can, however, buy you
plastic flowers and inexpensive sweets. I can help you with your final
college paper, but only if you would offer to help me in mine after. I'm
being clever now, but that's because I am hoping that someday you would
let us be clever together.

Scum is sometimes needed to retain an insubstantial kind of masculinity.

### Entry # 66: *the fury of sunny days and humid nights*
Date: Wed, 29 Jan 2014

I used to say, "I am not a clone of my former self. The past belongs
only to the past." That unalterable segment of existence which I would
soon, bit after bit, forget. What I was before can't be what I am now
nor what I will be. Ever since people (and things) around me began
changing at a different rate, my life has been a slow process of
stepping down to bedrock. Something in them possessed a great influence
that I can't overpower. Is it because I was born to be a prey? But I am
not. I look back at the months gone by, thinking what happened. Or
rather, what have I been doing.

...

My people get drunk with me whenever their schedules permit them. They
have this habit of opening me up. I am their patient on an operating
table. One would pick a scalpel and plunge the thing down somewhere in
my abdomen; the other would strangle a dark flesh, pick it up and say,
"People, this is the liver." What a sight: waterproof fluid squirting
everywhere. "This is *your* liver in escapism." There would be
red drops in our drinks. Bloody Mary. And then I would reckon flashes of
the former days, lashes always lashing. The world never has deceived me.
I have many places in me. I can show you that. But you must knock first.

...

There was a blank sheet of paper in front of me. I folded it into a
blank bullet and fired it skywards. You know what's absurd?
People who hold you in their hatred lungs, claiming that you have injured them with
accidental projectiles, which, if only they really checked out, was
their own un/doing. I had to think of something to jot down on it. But
you---I can't be breathed into doing something just because you exhaled
my direction. So, fill in the gap. Fate is only a funny valentine, an
incredulous affair written randomly in the stretch of space, not on
paper nor in mind.

the seconds go by, and not one sign of drowsiness is here. i am pulled
back to surface by the imaginings i had this morning, perhaps an
induction of the infernal core.

the first one was about my oral hygiene. in real life, i brush my teeth
and wash my mouth at least twice a day. but it was in this moment that a
cyst sprouted at the far right corner of my mouth. it felt
discomforting. i could not bring to a full close my jaws because of the
lump. without warning, the cyst detached itself from the gums (this
happened abruptly), and out it came. the thing fell right into my hands.
i tried squishing it a bit, seeing if it would burst into a bloody mess.
there was a bad taste in my mouth, like a yellowish spunk of infection.
a hint of iron.

the second dream came around quickly, picking up where the first left
off. it was a party of douches and dames, the bass indelible, and why I
was even there made me wonder. there were hookers dancing at one corner,
giggling at their own reflections. high school friends were there, too.
they looked sleek in their thrift-shop suits. one of the hooker was
strip-teasing, and I watched a bit before finally retiring to one of the
bedrooms, bored to death. i was searching for something in there,
something i no longer knew, but was interrupted when one of the girls
came in without knocking. everything faded.

the last of these dreams was about an odd contest. it includes some
bulky guys. i can't remember clearly now the mechanics of the game,
but the emerging victor was supposed to
have an "intimate intercourse" with the trophy girl. didn't remember how
it came to be, but--but the girl was motionless as stone. something bad
was bound to happen, and i felt it was my duty to intervene. i sat down
on the bed beside her. she motioned me to lie down next to her. when I
did, she yanked my arms, and only then did I notice that she a former
schoolmate. she was saying something, that she didn't want all others
prying over her body, how monstrous they behaved, how savage; that I was
her savior, her last debuff that would put an end to all this scam.
maybe she was right, but in order to prove her theory, her particles
should not have begun drifting away.

No time for preparation
I muffled my breathing for someone beneath the bed.
The person kept shifting as the metal hinges creaked around me.
Someone yelled in the distant roundabouts of the street.
The person's breathing, and the occasional murmuring, was more audible, though.
The air around me diffuses, and I would be choking soon.

Dreams show you an escape;
nightmares pin you down.
This was about the latter.
The moment of helplessness, when you must realize this is just a dream.
You hope you are smart enough to convince yourself to snap out of it,
but sometimes, the magic does not work.
It needs the latest patch, this *magic*,
and you wonder if it's already available on the App Store.

The person sensed a shuffling below. They stood up, metal hinges creaking noisily, and checked.
*She* was naked---this I duly
noticed---peering into my eyes.
A woman, twenty-plus-plus of age.
Had I given more interest in social sciences,
I could have easily figured out the constructs that baffled the pools she was whirling me in.
However, she did not mind seeing me there, a pollutant, a beg bud
(or bed bug) lying quietly, breathing heavily in this tight space.
She lay down on the wooden floor and rolled towards me under the bed.
We gazed long enough before finally closing our eyes and did what had to be done.
When I tried sliding my tongue into her mouth,
she gently pushed me off, smiled, and said,
"No, no tongue. Tongue is for pussies."

It was just a phase. And I was just fooling around when I said something
about a recent thought of inter-species prostitution, an idea I am now
alienating myself from after watching *District 9* for the third time.
That was a bit tough to stomach, I know; and no one, I think, could
digest the thought without feeling nauseous. But I was just fooling around. Just
being me, being funny.

I can be dark and shallow when agitated; more so when pushed to the
edge. What you did kind of forced me to the edge. You were being nasty.
The stuff coming out of your foul mouth was boiling like an ectoplasmic
substance. You were just ugly. I thought of landing several fists on
your face, but I couldn't. I just could not.

I see the curves and rolls, but none of them sticks to the heart.
I see Mt. Fuji in every one of them.
I look up and find it odd to say that none of them could really take me anywhere.
They suffer the consistency of fluctuation.
The movement of fashionistas impregnating their to-wear lists with high-end garments,
but I won't do anything about it.
It might have even occurred to me to begin to hate them and the way they gyrate at anything that juts up the trend,
but no, I won't do that.
Porcelain faces in horror movies have come out of the silver screen to haunt me during dawn.
They evaporate and condense; they disintegrate and materialize.
Stirrings are dragged down to the bottom by an unwanted enigma, and all
the sediments pile up. The accumulated weight is a force enough to
pressurize the amalgam into a hard slab. It is a mysterious event, if
you really want to know.

Hunger encroaches me as I leave my core crooning on empty rambles.
It wails like a cat, yearning, wanting comfort. But don't cats solve
problems by themselves? They stoop on hot solids for warmth; they make
themselves fit in narrow places for comfort. They are mathematicians,
geniuses of the hexagonal cliques, indifferent to the happenings below
and above them. So are my guts. My iron guts. My
expanding-then-contracting-then-expanding-again guts. My forlorn,
agitated, sweet, empty guts. My chemical guts. Well, if you wanted

I admire the discretion you like to keep in your circle, but have your
eyes laid upon what's real? It's still out there. Compose all
you want, but it does not do away the hunger and thirst, the lack of
clothing.

Mark of proboscis left pinkish dots on my legs last night, and that's
nothing. When I was a youngster, I used to apply hydrogen peroxide on an
open wound I got from a roach bite, and the infected area would fizzle
like soda. Crummy! I used to chug down my old man's leftover drinks
because I wanted to maximize our water consumption. That, or I simply
wanted to prove something. Our lives were impeded by this kind of
living. It was not my choice, however. There was no nobility in it, as
you may have heard. Only instincts on loop.

If you were annoyed by the extreme impoliteness of those you have
touched with your keen sense of romance, then I don't get you or your
kin. Your story are written in books so few I bet they're treasure. I
will bring myself to this: you do *not* suck, oh perfected being.
Although it shouldn't be anyone's nature, I cannot blame them for
looking up to you with their sunglasses on. Again: you do not suck. Not
the slightest bit. You do, however, contain somewhere in your core the
need to obliterate. Golems will bow down before you. Totems will be
erected in your presence. But you will be the storm that doesn't give a
damn. For that, I will be secretly be battling against myself (again)
for such is athletics, and athletics means endurance.

Go back to the years of small talk, and you might just see what I have
seen in the eyes of many. I know the alleys at night are quite dark, but
the infection is real. Maybe an agua oxinada flashflood would come soon.

It was the musty atmosphere that makes those dots in the night sky

A hot gust of vapor draws abstract murals from dust particles on
decrepit vestiges. Invasive is the dust twister, momentous the amber, as
restless as I, submitting all to droop under the shades. I've been
waking early to long hours of stagnation, torn already and, come noon,
odorous of mixed sweat and cheap perfume. This is a way of life that's
supposed to be something good, but has gone otherwise. It would be
helpful, though, if a sort-of god would fall from somewhere and start
directing the flow of traffic---what goes where, which goes here. But no
astral transfiguration would ever occur, however dire the problems are.
For contingencies such as this, I must not resort into believing
nonexistent deities but must possess a sound mind, instead.

### Entry # 76

I always feel as though I've forgotten something. That much is
certain, though, that I've forgotten a great deal, but this nagging
feeling of forgotten priority or importance is always there---that
without remembering I stand to lose a great deal. So each moment
becomes a struggle to remember. Remembering is easy, though, for me
anyway. Or it once was, but it still seems to be. I choose to forget
now. I spent the bulk of my childhood remembering, without choice,
flowing into what I've become as an adult; if you forget, you're
forgotten: undependable, dead-weight, uncaring. It all comes down to
time---what we think about time---because remembering only matters in
the context of promptness, that you remember when the time is nigh.
Miss the moment and the remembering no longer matters, or not in the
same way anyway (like *l'esprit d'escalier*). Keeping deadlines,
delivering on demand, and giving people a reason to trust you with
themselves: this is what remembering consists in. And I choose to
forget. And that's inertia; that's death, the default setting we'll
turn back to in the end. But writing is remembering, and, on some
basic level, I think thought is too. So for now I'll sleep, forget all
this, and you will too. Maybe I've forgotten that it's okay to forget,
but I'm sure I'll forget that too, once it's time to remember again.

The busiest parts of the city are the dirtiest. The playground of imps.
Vehicles bucking on bumpers upon bumpers; and drivers are not so
different. Everyone's strategy: cut into line, be ahead.
The smog causes a dull buzz below the folds of the forehead. I walked
on calloused roads with a smile in my head. It seemed to be a good fuel
for the core. On long and tiring treks along pavements with marred and
tainted dimwits, if one must pursue one, I suggest keeping a slip of
happy in the chink of the mind. Works wonders.

I don't mind playing with people who listen drone tracks on
YouTube for entertainment, because they're the ones who have interesting
thoughts to share.

I don't mind alpha beings of my social circle hexing me. I have
done a lot of bad things, and a little curse from them would only serve
as a reminder that I should do worse.

I don't mind being missed by some chubby lass who happens to be one of
the peers' leading darlings, even if she's just joking. I don't mind
because I don't believe her. She's just being nice. Sometimes, I would
like to think of myself as immune to such charms, but some charms
develop new kind of strains that pass through my defense system.

I don't mind not fitting anywhere with anyone, because no matter what I
do, there will still be empty slots for me to get in.

I don't mind being unable to patch this wanton bleeding with a remedial
touch, for there will be appropriate hands willing to do that. I'll just
have to hang on and look for them and hope it's not too late.

the things i would say to my kindergarten-self are definitive on their
own. it's just that, this boy was past his time that he couldn't even look
after his own or smell his morning breath. he would brush his teeth. he
would smell of his parents' cologne, because to his senses,
they reminded him of people who loved his every cell. he could
tie his own shoelaces, and now look at him, tall enough to see what's
over the fence.

i am him. or more appropriately, i *was* him. to be honest, i white-lied
when i/he said a paragraph ago that his idiocy in the vastness of the
cosmic plane was noticeable, but such was not always the case. there
were holes in him which were passed down as a genetic malnutrition to a
much younger sibling, and had he been eager to fill them with something,
he would have been a hole himself. but he is me now. and i am getting

And when something real cannot happen to people with glossy, fragile
skins, or the natural flow of things does not provide them what they
need or want, I have some explaining to do.

People, including you and me, embalm their selves with the platitudes of
comfort and lies, their disappointed when reality overpowers
expectations. It's always a nasty feeling. Do not force a lid onto a
boiling pot of stew.

However they defy their insides, it will always be too repulsive, and
instinctively, they will groan in disbelief. If they would find
themselves more miserable than before,
it could be that theirclothes don't fit anymore,
and they who have endured the
discomfort just to invigorate minds will no longer be known to the true

Snitches and their knack for uttering in cursed tongue the strangest of

to, more so their ineffective disguise of their own tedious statures
jeweled only so as to steer the optical inferences from the truth.

I have tried to mingle with these porcelain-skinned hippos, observe
their mannerisms from a fence, and---and this is for the future
seedlings, so listen up---none of which are astonishing. I can get
more hype from staring at a full moon. That shit gets me hanging all the
time, not these bipeds. I will not be forcing an attempt sojourning

Sweat was smelly underneath the clothes. Indeed, it was a race against
the self, against his tigers that had lain dormant and have now trembled
awake---the tormentors versus the tormented. He perished in discomfort.
Knowing that his body had become the adversary did not help. Giving up
was not an option, though. He dragged on continuously, careful not to
lose concentration. With determination, he was convinced that this
stupid skirmish was his to win. Vengeance and its squalor would be

You are an entity I hear as the headphones speak to me in lyrical glum,
you who have taken residence in the smug of a mind. I feel you as
glowing lamp or a growing lump homing for the core.

Too, I feel dispirited knowing your nearness is as far as you are, but
the distance does not always matter, especially when things involved are
beyond logical entanglement and scientific method. My eyes can only
discern objects up to about 10 kilometers, yet the syntax of the
physical stretch is making me sketch on the eyes. This itch requires
them to be drugged with special milk drops as the lactose in them is
rumored to reduce the redness of the sclera, although---who am I
kidding?

The mourning is over. The bills now pile up, and you have left the spot.
However, as long as memories remain mine, I'll seek more of you in my
clammy head, and less of the hopes that are stolen from me by the real
icon of you here in my computer, and by fate.

checking on us if we have sunken enough to the lowest of our low. I am
cold, but I don't need anyone sharing my cot. It is small and narrow,
and I don't like sharing it with another human being. Besides, there is

I see you evolve every time I visit you here. I see you grow, as time
passes, more refreshing, the blur stuffier. The friendly aura is
understandable, but friends in any form or shape in this region are made
up of surges and of subconsciousness.

This is a giveaway: your soul rests upon the blinding neon lights, but I
don't believe in the existence of souls. They're just one of those terms
people use as an excuse to be hyperbolic about whoever is no longer in
the physical here. Whatever happiness or sadness or weariness you
consume consumes me as well. We are here, and it is in this isolation we
are linked.

Forward again through the slosh of nosy people who have always been
imprudent when they step on feet unknown. Watch their faces smirk as you
frown upon them. They never apologize, at least not with words. They
just cock their heads slightly forward, a palm up. *Idiots*.
Nevertheless, I could pass this as a reasonable excuse. Nowhere is safe.
A fact.

This is a daily routine to and from school. That inevitable commutation
from point A to point B. I study people from a distance carefully. I
could earn a degree called Bachelor of Science in Sociopathological
Polyphasing---whatever that means. My hands on my pockets, sometimes
always, sometimes never. There's no such thing as being too alert. It
isn't comfortable anywhere near these people, in this kind of density.

Fellow commuters do the same. They get lost. Lean on a dry wall, their
hopes fleshing out their glimpses until they bleed out their entire

I will tell you any of the jukebox jokes I heard from a recent elevator

to someone who has no basic interest invested in me. I recall your
fondness for stupidity-masked garbage-can comedians (which explains why
you like oscar the grouch), but I am more of a cynical ass-hat rather
than the funny guy you knew from years back.

"You are the love of my life," said no one, not even me. "---but i will
let you know every now and then that a good laugh makes it somehow a bit
bearable." It is a good point. I like how it is pungent on my tongue,
the way it clicks.

Every time I make my way down the staircase, the spirits of the past
keep pulling me back up to the first step. they know it will be hard all
over again.

(At the back, somebody is secretly paying attention to my maneuvers, but
he's just a furry douche. He is bound to be like that. He will end up
puking by the sewers one day and he will rejoice on ten meals a week. No
one actually minds him; that is, in the conventional sense of
mindfulness. He too is full of jokes. From birth until he gives his
entire existence to this branch of the hyperspace. You will like him
when you meet him.)

cranial asylum, always on the brink of lacunar amnesia. the ability of
how a person can remember to wait varies solely on the song being played

this has been too long a wait for precipitation, too tiring an amble

Gone were the days that made me so proud about this place. Gone was its
magnificence. The city swells; in it are torn people wanting to survive

To let the joules die down even amid this season is pragmatic, but to
what extent is it considered to be sane still? I get the occasional
desire of diving in a pool of water. The reason behind this may have
something to do with heat being related to fire, and fire being quenched
by water, thinking that by diving into the blues will somehow lower our
body temperature. However, this concept is only true in some cases. Not
all the time does water extinguish fire, or in this case, body heat; is
the water in the form of steam? Is it boiling? Is the water a hard block

so boundless was the poor man's want to leave that he forgot to look
out, and was stuck instead in the misgivings and misleadings of the past
and present for another week. if isn't obvious enough, let me tell you:
it sucks.

Rudeness is as internally ubiquitous as every oscillating particle in
our being, but being the sentient creatures that we are, committing such
is more of a choice than a predetermined fate.

tell a parent that,
for succumbing to the groundless notions of other
people, you don't blame them for not gaining experience and, thus, not
leveling up. it was when you last checked yourself on the mirror, hair
so unkempt i swear ants are already stockpiling there for december, that
you realized everything (and nothing) is the result of your knock-outs.
look into yourself now. you will see a wooden drawer painted white. pull
the top most compartment. when you check the files dated april 30^th^ of
every year, notice that there is nothing out of place. in fact, there is
nothing but but's.

nightmarish distresses have me by the neck as each sends me to hysteria.
blood gushes to throat, vehemently throbbing. i am left immobile and
paralyzed, vulnerable to my own mind's freak shows. here are the latest
ones:

- A man in his suit named Lou stood sweating in front me.
From his pocket, he drew what seemed like a dagger and quickly plunged the
tool deep into his chest. He gurgled, wriggled, and died. Moreover,
that he was in a suit and named Lou could be the closest I can be of
getting Litt up.
- VIP pass to a photoshoot of a famous fashion magazine. Semi-nude
models sprung out of the wardrobe and into the set. Their eyes were
as wide as their grins.
- I poured hot water in a porcelain cup before thinking that "the heat
is stupid." I let the cup be fully heated before I poured out the
hot water. Then, I poured in ice cold water. The abrupt change in
temperature caused the cup to crack, crumble, and shatter in my
hands.

In the passing of time, I have read several articles about the truces
between the upper and lower layers of forgetfulness, and how each fold
is affecting the ones adjacent to it. But if I should re-type from
memory the first two sentences of each article, I could be wrong.
Memories are often misleading, and everyone knows that.

Sometimes I listen to music to help me remember what I should have
forgotten, a note assigned to each ego I have shed, one beat for every
tooth I have misplaced. There are questions, too, that are triggered by
some tracks, and usually, the answers to those are something about
learning (or choosing not to) from the sections we divide to belong on
the left side of spacetime line. As we skim the past, we will see traces
of sound waves that bring out the melodies we long to disinfect but
somehow cannot. Makes me wonder: Why bother re-tracking what is or are
not anymore?

the crisp in one's face becomes crinkled upon agreeing with the internal
faction of the self to set out on a trek away from the living
standardized by the norms of the environs. 
only a philosophy founded on empirical accounts could have supported this
belief.

"it might work," one would say. (*what might work?*
the crowd would ask. this time, however, one no longer pays
attention to the whims of many.) and to believe it to be the road to
recovery is one thing; it is another for it to actually work. if and
when asked, one would openly admit that without professional assistance,
the outcomes are blurry at best. if done right, it could act as a
placebo; otherwise, a paraplegia of sorts. it really depends, this
figure now thinks, on the setting of the journey and, ultimately, the
destination.

i took off, leaving a few sweetened nothings to those who saw me on
my way out, but there were busy spirits upstairs so absorbed in other
things that i did not mind saying goodbye to them. i thought it was
cool, disappearing like that, but it isn't. it was me breaking my own
fingers, thinking the spasms would go unnoticed; immature and unclean.

the 'spirits', via text, told me, "we didn't know you already left.
say goodbye next time, will you? haha. take care."

the message was so
striking i cannot help but feel sorry for myself.
again, my actions have
let down the important people in my life.

small regrets do add up to form an indelible one.

the point of buying movie tickets is to have the best place in the
theater, and in my opinion, that would be four to six rows from the first.
apparently, many still prefer to watch from the balcony, the point of
which i don't understand. isn't it the same as watching at home on a
42" tv? if i were to spend my money on cinema, i'd make
the most out of it by placing myself where the magic happens.

however, i didn't want to argue with the couple who dragged me to go
and watch the latest installment about mutants.
after all, my ticket came from their money;
and any intolerable situation that comes with good freebies i can
purge later over the net. call it whining or complaining, whatever

The hot eastern breeze brings me again the smell of the dying spirit of
a man who, at his drifting moments, prefers to be drunk than to be
sober. He sends absurd messages about the value of family and friends,
and the need to glorify a supreme being. Is this the manifestation of
his ancient doings, to be a sorry figure he inflicted upon himself long
ago, a silhouette among the sunny crowd that demands only pity because
he can no longer afford one for himself?

We throw first the ball far out the verdant field, hoping a loyal friend
would get it for us. But that isn't how loyalty is determined. And so,
having finally noticed that the ball is there and we are here, and no
one else would retrieve it for us, we ourselves fetch what we have
thrown. We are our own dogs, leashed, illogical. Why are we even willing
to do even simple things for a greater authority? And, isn't this
greater authority our own selves? We did not realize that early on. Too
dumb, actually, to have thrown something away in the first place that we
would want or need right away.

This old man had thrown away his one life, and now, it's almost too late
to think things over, especially that his mind smells foggy with brandy.

She sends an e-mail to her latest lover every time something important
comes up. She is with us, but her mind is across time zones, the globe
she spins as her own, wondering what he has bee doing. Is he eating junk
food? Is he himself a piece of junk? Will he be sharing bread to help us
out here in this tropical place? Her eyes dance to the bits of waiting,
but can only be so patient. She waits for him to go online every night,
and when he does, they would spend hours chatting about the things they
already know. Hours of canned convo on loop. Why? Because people are
dying to hear something familiar again.

Everything is quickly becoming foreign to everyone. Even the space is
altered constantly to blur tick after tick the visions of moments ago.
Details are microscopic as observed from a perspective. Despite this,
the world still feels the same, the grand blanket not threatened. Too
many earthly heartaches, afraid of the known and unknown and all those
in the un-categorized synapses.

She looked beautiful yesterday, but an hour ago, she decayed a bit. So
he must be updated, lest he recognizes this person of his interest no

The gaps themselves serve as tips on how to quantify the seemingly
immeasurable stretch between two points. The tension does us a
disservice and at the same time connects us at some caring level: a
pull-here push-there mechanism we barely can integrate into our senses.
Start convincing ourselves to put aside these variances, and instead,
begin to nurture the remaining similarities, minute though they may be;
here commences the series of stimulation where respect for the other
becomes more pronounced through actions, growing little by little. The
liking of personalities comes afterwards, being able to forget to look
down on our altered views of living, finally agreeing at something
compassionate or unique or otherworldly. --*No*, we will not admit that
there is something more to this flimflam, but soon enough, we will lock
ourselves in distressing passion, and whatnot.

Do some bad things for your own detox, but ultimately, you should not be
so cruel to yourself. The frailty that is your own dumbness can subject
you to hazards, but this does not always permit you to search for your
things in the wrong places. In the mornings when the sun is hiding
behind the vapors, have an apple or a banana or a coffee, or any other
ABC's, because your purpose for yourself is to be in mint condition.
most of the time, it is Monday. Do not look for your undergarments in
the wrong pile of clothes. Have you forgotten where you placed them? Too
bad. Somebody might have already bleached your granny boxers for you, in
which case, set the said pile ablaze and seek solace from the warmth of
its fire.

i rattled the crisp carcass on my head along with me not only because i
needed it to confirm how dubious strangers can get (and i was right--two
individuals gazed at me in a bad way), but also it doubles as an
adorable protection from the sun (but i was wrong--my scalp almost
burned). a bird can perch in the nest of my hair, and i would not mind.
anyway, there was i walking towards a skinny buddy familiar only to keen
senses, for after all these months that i have not seen him, he has not
gained weight nor another strand of hair. he told me that not much has
changed since last we met: him, slim and peculiar; i, outstanding only
in implosion.

we both complained about the thinning of the ozone.
you see, in many ways we are similar. we grumble at anything of minute
importance, from the dots of our being to the relevance of government,
ans such and such. i was about to tell him this discernment, but when i
looked over my shoulder, the guy was gone.

the afternoon was deadly, nothing unusual. anything can disappear
and anyone with asthma would want to disappear. i moved on.

i went back to the old apartment, and therein stood a lovely parent
waiting for me. she seemed more organic now. buddy and hogan[^b-and-h] have been moved out.
our refrigerator was gone. most of the objects that we had
were no longer there. she sold so many things. the living room was the
only sentiment of this abode's previous splendor left, and even in that
moment, it echoed the chills of the occupants who once had been screwing
their lives there. "where is everybody?" i asked my mother. she did not
speak. maybe she was disappointed, too. this rest house, this anthill,
no more.

[^b-and-h]: Run free and wild, Buddy and Hogan, wherever you are.

I will fail to distinguish the abilities of devices, if any, modern or

any promises of coming up with an epistolary compilation plummeted to
naught when the receiving party, on thorough dissection of the contents
of the mail, chose not to reply. the sending party might have penned
something barely inducing a response, but how could they know? they are
not the smartest guild in this damned rut. their hearts convulse at
small inconveniences, their brains short out. fools!--they had to bother
the mailman for many months just to realize nothing was coming their
way.

it is all in the past now, and everybody changes places at some point in
life, builds new forts, or adapts into a new circle of unfriendly
neighborhood. the return address on that mail does not belong to anybody
anymore. and the mailman, now happier, has been untouched since.

I could hardly make out the figures of stoichiometry chalked on the
board, or hear from the soft droning the instructor's purr. There was no
dullness in any chemistry class I have been, until that moment, when in
a blink I found myself---quite instantaneously, as if bypassing the
physical laws of nature---lying on a bed. In that moment of my
teleportation, came in the room a girl of familiar shape. We used to
hang out together. We played with flames, but along the way an
obstruction was formed. It all just did not feel right anymore. Funny
how small things can make big differences. The flames were extinguished,
and it was all queasiness from there.

Anyway, she came in the room and feigned surprise. I was *not* in my
bedroom. But her walking in was graceful and felt natural, like I had
predicted her going in the room and likewise, she was expecting to see
me there, and that my being unexpectedly there was something easily
thrown out of the picture. We made out on the bed, which felt good. And
remembering *this whole dream* I had still makes me feel good, but not
in the way you are probably thinking right now.

**Scene 1**: It is tough to look at the songbook for a number for the jays to sing.
Your lungs don't hold as much air as you'd like. They go out when
the crowd doesn't have a clue on what you're on to, if you really
were in sync with the karaoke. On the plus side, your voice sucks.
Another party blending, human tapestries to shy away from. It is
altogether different in the rural villages. The audience there are
more tolerable.

**Scene 2**: A housemate dragged me in front of his girl to celebrate a two-decade
defeat. My eyes hardly peeled themselves as he prompted me to a glass
stall of many a love song.

**Scene 3**: Gut me not as I down my last meal in zero expertise. It feels good to
know that such food is possible in a lewd setting. I have always
thought of KTV bars as establishments erected solely for old timers
willing to empty their wallets in exchange for a quick relief. I was
wrong. Good grub, bad choice. Good drag, bad voice.

**Scene 4**: Two tables actively participated in a garbling chorale during the
happy hour. Tough battle.

when an earthquake of low magnitude shakes the
place and is felt by the millions of strangers prancing on afternoon
streets, go directly to the nearest wifi hotspot, ideally a coffee shop,
and hop online. but don't you just post a mindless "did you just feel
that earthquake?" status to direct the local netizens' attention to the
obvious. do not cheat nor settle for this mediocre chore. you, as a
trickster of various complex trades, are better than that.

instead, say:
"i witnessed something that trembled me to my knees. i was on the
twelfth floor when the ground beneath the cars of the street across this
building convulsed and split, and from the fissure, at least four iron
tendrils, each as long as a ten-wheeler, came out and started striking
and crushing all the moving objects nearby. every businessmen sprinted
off from the chaos; the hipsters held up their smartphones (run, you
bastards!); the lovers accepted their fate. when the ground quaked
again, the cleft grew wider, eating the street up (and all on it) until
the sidewalks became the dried lips of a gaping mouth. from this
opening, an abysmal cyber-cuttlefish slowly rose. as i type this, the
fins just passed by my window. why do i feel leaden? i'm afraid this
city will be baptized very, very soon."

1.  in pulling down the lever that opens the louvre, the light reveals
    unto thee the crisis of spatial contingency located in the gap
    between two households. this gap is an outside basement of ancient
    debris, an ecosystem for stray cats and other non-mammalian pests
    that, come dusk, bug you with eerie messages. this is your view when
    you get up late in the morning, when you recover again from the
    previous hours what you claimed you'd  have forgotten by daylight.
    reminder: push back up the louvre lever during bad weather,
    because there is a rain drain pipe about a meter away of which end
    opening conveniently faces your window. on stormy days, your view is
    niagara falls.
2.  what kind of room is this? a sliding door with a hook-and-eye lock?
    even the hounds can topple it.
3.  speaking of hounds, there are two of them of the same muscular
    build. the younger one frequently sprites on furniture and footwear
    and the trash bin, and leaves a mess when he's left unchecked. if
    caught doing misdeeds, i beg you, do not grab the broom stick and
    whack him like a golf ball. you imbecile, you irresponsible dog
    owner. teach him manners without using fear and violence. be cesar
    millan. besides, golf sucks. and golf courses waste acres of space.
4.  the only credit i can give to the entirety of golf is in the
    engineering that lies on the ball itself. its pioneers were smart to
    design onto its surface a tessellation (of sorts) of dimples that
    would make it fly efficiently in terms of aerodynamics.
5.  one more time, i froze in an un-cool way, the way in which i put a
    palm over my mouth, and my pupils dilate. it is hard to regain from
    a shocking incident. i shall narrate briefly about it, nonetheless:
    my cousin and i were eating our dinner together, talking about the
    richest drummers---because david grohl was on tv at the moment---when
    from midair and onto our food landed a rogue cockroach. it
    strolled over our dinner, and my pal started cursing at it,
    profusely so. the villain was uninterested in humanspeak. cousin
    spooned it out and placed it atop the table, still near the food,
    and stood up to get the insect spray. like i told you, the whole
    time i froze in an un-cool way, not because i feel icky around
    roaches, no. it was this bold move, to not give a damn about humans
    having their dinner, that insulted me speechless. BAH---the memory
    is fresh: the soft buzz of the wings, its hideous presence, its
    indifference. i know it's over.

Stooped on a seat and quiet was the only friend. Your drink was rattling
on the table turning sour. It was a cough of coffee from somewhere,
another item on my list of odd offerings from myself to myself---the
strangest one, by the way, is a sleeping pill. It's funny because it's
an antidepressant that opposes the main function of caffeine, and could
someone be held responsible if these were inaccurate? Yet, I would
rather gulp petroleum. I mean, I would *never* drink fossil fuel,
because that would be crude. My mother used to bring home Arabian
beverages, but none of them could restore the lost youthful vigor. 

My veins at the side of my head feel like vines creeping up a steeple of
nowhere-land, green whips lashing all at once a crack. 

And when Time slowly ripened---the boy ageing to a man, passed from one
to somebody's meager hands---the Life, if it were one, was
threatened, when the last option was to choke the limbered existence
with a fade from the changing smoke.

the flesh had avoided mingling, and now, it longed for warmth. i
strolled down the grime network of alleys and streets. at night in some
corners, an armed man waits for his next victim. one could die for the
simplest yet stupidest reasons. good thing i did not fancy the night
mistress that time nor did her darklings paid me visit. i did stroll at
daytime, safe and away from curs; and went out and met the disorder
pleasantly. i exist *here and now*, that means i took the *right* turn
homeward and slept through nocturia. 

some say the way to a thug's heart is to fiddle first through their
fatty liver and then their blackened lungs. others prefer the benign
processes of social merry-making in which only money talks. but since i
did not inherit the gambling traits of my father, this suggests that i

When you look at your watch, you perceive the duration of your stay. It
is alluring in itself: its hands beckoning your eyes to look at it again
when just ten seconds ago, you checked the time. Unless your reality
twists on itself in a loop, ten-second moment does not change much.

Alas, you have no watch, yet you imagined yourself wearing one. That
feeling when a concept materializes because (y)our mind can be, at some
instances, playful; when you are humming a tune and suddenly the radio is
playing it; or when the door reveals what's on the other side but you
already know what or what not to expect. This is the time you feign the
awe, and since no one will do it for you, might as well rediscover your
type of entertainment.

So look inward, and tell me what's in the stall. Do you see magazines
filed in a rack? Now, don't let your hands rearrange them in an order---usually,
the most informative ones in the front, fashion mags at the
back. No one cares about your pick nor your priorities. Or, do you see
your favorite electronic apparatuses? (Again, don't.) Do you see plates
of food? (Surely, you won't.) Is this your enjoyment? Would you like to
grab one for yourself? Do you buy your happiness? If, instead, you see
abstract objects---colorful and always psychedelic---it's because you
haven't been in extravagant shopping centers.

Everything might have seemed illustrious at one point in your life, but
I think it was a part of a long-ago blindness, when your status was
still surrounded in debris, and you and your friends played in front of
the rich man's gates because that was all this penury could offer.

plastic bag broke at the bottom due to much weight, and all the rubbish
and garbage juice splattered on the ground. i picked them one by one and
put them back in the bag, which just slipped right out of the hole. this
went on for minutes, until i felt a squirming sensation in my mouth, as
if to snap me out of my focus. i spat on the ground. it was all saliva,
blood, and maggots. i spat some more, because the squirming would not
stop. still, blood and maggots. horrifying.

### Entry # 138: *afternoon ale-ment*
Date: Tue, 22 Jul 2014

a guitar man once told me that people find creative ways to authenticate
their unhappiness. i thought to myself, "do they also generate their
own festering?" 

i attempt this now, because my self as usual belongs to a different
place and time, the self that waxes some fake wings onto his back to fly
above the cityscape just to have a talk with you---

would you swear to tell me next time we meet on that alternative setting
the consequences of ignorance regarding the science of jesters
conscripting their fellow jokers under depressive fumes? humor seeks to
temper the blemished cheeks. yours, though, as i remember it, is beyond
despair. the way people snap their necks to your way just to claim your
cheekiness for their own, even for a while. or the way they applaud at
you every time you share a laugh. they are selfish. they only want to
have *your* fun for *them*selves. and by 'they', i mean 'we'. by 'we',
'i'.

and if i may, i want to tell you some things. don't worry, though. the
sun is high and the wax melts on my back. i am dizzy from keeping my
composure here mid-air. the harder i fight the fall, the dizzier it
gets. i'm not sure you can condone this, but this will be over soon. i
will tell you this in the most non-poetic method i can, as poets are
often misunderstood, and i don't want to be it that way.

...periodically, i wear jackets of different thickness to fend off the
cold that is never here. remember, the sun is high on my back. i can't
even imagine what winter feels like or what six sol-less months must be
on the skin, as i have lived my entire life in a tropical metropolis.
yet, whenever it is unusually chilling and/or i just feel fashionable, i
wear jackets.

why jackets? why of different thickness? (i ask questions i want to
answer myself. read on to not know why.)

the phantoms---phantoms being strangers enlisted under 'painfully
wonderful'---avoid making themselves visible, but when i spot one, i
acknowledge them with all the disease in my heart. i shiver. i steal
from my courage, and look. my hopes, on the other hand, strive not too
hard in the labyrinthine craft of the virginal, semi-acoustic,
like-minded imaginings of art and clarity of cloisters found both inside
and out of my pad. i need to have a third set of skin to protect me.
like the glossy veil that hugs a hardbound's cardboard shell. a cover to
cover the cover, you might say.

as long as the thought of any self-rubbing, self-squeezing celestia i
have down under my clothes, there would be no problem. as long as you
find the idea of it appropriate for you to hold, then i shall, with
all of my calories, stand ever so firmly with this your notion,
even if it directs me to my perdition.

immortality is a cheat index to fulfill a lifelong death wish. you do
recall, don't you? it is also the wax that holds together my
'flappiness' that is almost gone now, and yet here i am, asserting the
point still. you do recall, don't you? well, *i don't*, but it doesn't
mean it's not true in many cases.

*in any case*, i know this afternoon is spent yet again in trance, the
prismatic heavens dancing along my breadth, but i enjoyed it since i
have you to guide me safely into a landing spot as my wings finally
detach themselves off of my spine.

### Entry # 139: *mortals and pestles*
Date: Thu, 24 Jul 2014

Shortly after an earthquake dream, I wriggled out of the blanket into
the world downsized from its colossal stature.

Inside dreamland, everything is blown up out of scale, and the dreamer
will have to resort to other forms of traveling. Once, I summoned a
firetruck and boarded it. I escaped a traffic jam but was later flagged
down by a traffic enforcer. What said he? He scribbled on some
ticket-pad as I reasoned my way out of this mess. "But Officer, this
must be a dream?"

I resumed much later my choking seizures, because that is how I deal
with the contingencies of my itchy closet life.

Mortality, if anything, is a bitter potion I have been drinking from the
fountain of my grandma's garden. It helped me flush down the lipids that
were passed to me down by her black sheep offspring through genetics,
which were then stuffed in my atria at the dawn of my existence. I don't
know what to make of that, but it was boiling in me. That was a long
while ago, though, at least several hundred honeymoons into the past.

And if the ground shakes again the next time I lose consciousness? Or is
the inversion of this that I must be aware of?

Everybody would shift from side to side, their pelvic bones gyrating
without me, retracing lost steps on grand parquet still without me. I
would have to dance alone to safety. However, this is nothing new to me---a task from my routine, it simply is.

I don't like how this is gradually becoming a burden when I really think
it isn't, and I can't be certain anymore whether meteors are worth the
synthetic stigma of aspiring spacepeople. Or of astrologers who think of
them as the trails of omen.

Actions are supposedly rougher than things involving those being still.
The sirens are fast asleep and the vehement things (i.e., *very* bad
people) are thrown back into the mix. If there is one moment of peace amid
commotion, it happens on a bed.

The collected horns of traffic rising up to the challenge went on
tirelessly. Another day to get by. I knew that I must look in every
direction before crossing the street. At one moment, a truck étude blew me
off as if to say "Speed up!"
The driver did not wave a hand when I looked up at him through the windshield,
but, in a raspy yell, said some bad things. This must be the workings of
having to wake up early in the morning, groggy still and breakfast-less,
to deliver big things big people buy, in order to live by until the next
paycheck. I forgave him for being crass and out of mechanical
practicality. I could have flipped him the bird, but that would not have
taken the both of us anywhere. 

As I walked on, I saw a tramp waving at me. He is fat and ugly and
untidy. His smile was devilish but kind. I did not give him any spare
change. He quickly averted his attention toward another soloist about a
few meters behind me.

There was a time in the past when I imagined myself walking the streets
of Manila, with a placard containing cryptic message, begging for alms.
What could the reasons be that I had to escape all civilized endeavors
and be a vagabond? I wanted to know how difficult it must feel knowing
that pedestrians would never look at me the same way. Also, could I go
under the radar long enough for everyone to forget I ever existed? It is
possible, I thought, since authorities pay no attention to missing
individuals of little importance to society. Make no mistake: this was
out of curiosity and not of deluded romanticism.

I guess, I just wanted to travel by foot, see where my legs would take
me.

**she danced with the 17 roses unceremonously.** there was a hint of
contentment, though. i think the 13th and 14th roses are her flings. i
can tell by the way her lady friends shrill their *kilig*. she must make
a choice soon, though. it is a fickle thing, *love*, especially at such
an age when the body dictates the mind and not the other way.

she is my second cousin. in the clan's customs, everyone should know
everyone, but i have been too busy with the immediate radius that i did
not bother expanding my social circles. because i see no good point in
it, pretending to want to be around a relative i barely grew up with.

and yet, i was watching her enjoy herself.

they hired singers, too. i forgot what the guy was singing in this part,
but it was very good. the quality of his quips? inversely proportional.

in between dances, my table mates and i would excuse ourselves for a
breath of air. outside the venue, there's a photo booth. we went there.

my hair was unruly, as always, but it was the first time that night that
i saw how terrible the case was. i could pass as the next vocalist of
The Cure. we took pictures anyway.

**back inside**, they already serverd the dessert. it was a
bland gelatin, yellowish in color, almost like a pus. would not be
surprised if it tasted like one too.

my seatmate, Gary, turned to me and said, "everyone is about to cry." i
looked up and saw why.

when the debutante threw her arms around her father, heaps of the crowd
wept. he's the 18th rose. the last dance? aunt says he's been diagnosed
with stage 2 prostate cancer. says his days are numbered.

she has every reason to cry.

my eyes were itchy. must be the dust.

**hotel food is always rubbish.** always prepared sans passion. i have
watched too many cooking shows, and that must be the reason why i expect
so much every time.


**soon enough**, the old man was drunk and making noises again, as were
his table mates. thirty minutes before the party even began, they were
already drinking shots of double black. he brings shame wherever he
goes. there's that.

**does anyone wish people stopped attaching definitions to a certain
name?** i do. in my dream, i am always not me, which is good.

**a good drive** is doing at least 60kph in EDSA. EDSA! i am talking
about the most notorious avenue in the country being a free road!

driver, step on it, would you? get me out of here.

double black, per the suggestion of our resident ortho, must be tried by
anyone who fancies a clean hit, because "it's smoother than the black
label when it comes to sensation."

i was going to ask him to expound on this topic, but seeing the
speedometer swerve between 99 and 101 while cruising homebound on skyway
should be enough for me an evidence of his DUI as i leaned my head back
and closed my eyes.

bus stops full of air and smoke and not of people standing beneath,
because they no longer wait in safe places. they would rather jump
aboard anything that whooshes by above 40 kph than fan themselves in
boredom near suspicious-looking smugs. if you flag down something, be
prepared to run after it. it does not stop for anyone, and who you are
going to be after this commutation determines a good, at least decent,
fate only if you were alert. attention here is crucial. as is everywhere
else, i suppose.

### Entry # 145

it is rather simplified, i guess---the clouds spinning
invariably to form a greater cause of casualty, wherein the issues
involved do not attenuate the fear of getting struck by the heaven's
bolt, let alone help one to crawl back under a shade; that in this
dreamy hour, all rambling and rain-swept, i step back to the discomfort
of my moving legs, my first walk to my first school. it is just a lane
away from here. not too far. but to the calendars on which my memories
are taped may already be pushed way back in the distant space; and
need i some treading to reach it once again. again, for the sake of
doing something.

the learning center has been shut down for years. beyond the gates, last
i checked, were the peering capsules that used to modify the future
heroes whose guardians did not mind throwing away their money to the
modes, albeit ridiculous as i have learned in the grapevine, of
education that was never saintly contrary to the used-to slogan. as a
child, i was not informed of the ways of payroll. no child should ever
be burdened of it. here, i only learned the fundamentals.

my first school teacher, Carol, already a divorcée when i met her, said
that i was a brilliant kid. she stamped my hand with a purple star
labeled *very good*. i knew that apple was red, and that one apple added
to another makes two apples. rough guess: i was not born stupid.

it smelled like an infirmary, her small office, although at the time, i
did not know what infirmaries smelled like. the janitors, perhaps in
seeing that they would be mingling with kids everyday, had to sanitize
everything to bleach white. the basic stench could have fried our little
neurons, but i need a good source to back this up. it remains an
observation, untested in the laboratory or at the field of ascetic
hypotheses.

father told me her son died due to food poisoning. out of neglect. which
is why her husband decided to leave her for good. 

teacher Carol erected the center in memory of her dead son. thinking
about it now, it is weird, since the back story was unfit to support the
beams of this mini-institution, the slow degradation injected to the
thoughts of young enrollees, i included. the legacy lived on in spite of
it. the valedictory speech that excluded any formal attempts of
greeting, reduced to a simple nod to while away the persecutors perched
on their seats.

however, coming to grips, yes, this is it: mi último adiós, to the
necessities unfailingly dismissed by the order of hand landing briskly
on their cheeks.

it is often without good reason that i tend to push the things needed to
be done further into the calendar until pressure builds at one corner,
but today, four days from deadline, amid the tangle and toss of Recto
("rectum of Manila," Sionil José once said), i finished something
significant. i don't feel proud, though. just tired. and weary.

they say that delaying the accomplishment of a task improves the
quality of output. practitioners from the
medicine field might not agree on this.

din regurgitates into being much "oblivionism", a state in which no
other states exist except nothingness itself. and maybe train tracks,
and the train on it, and the people aboard the train. are they part of
this whole new nothingness experience? maybe, of the entire
consciousness where the 'soul' arrives.

every station is a new quest to find ways of austere astral jaunts, to
seek thrills that are slowly consuming. i think if alchemy were real, it
would be the grounds of metaphorical truths. or rather, it is only true
in metaphors.

nebulous cries dissolve in time, and as they do, they are converted to a
new form of energy, as if lead being transmuted to gold, poison to
elixir, burden to enlightenment.

i, mor(t)al, am running alongside a train trying to outrun it, all the
while singing a christmas carol. in here, however, one has no lordship
over one's speed. one simply witnesses oneself play for the theatrics of
one's mind.

i find it less odd to know how slow i am in a race against a machine.

i woke up feeling golden, which is not startling.

### Entry # 148: *for someone who dismisses horoscope, this is it*
Date: Wed, 13 Aug 2014

we can stay and be friends. 

we'll watch together other sunset photographers fill their portfolios with
overused motifs and themes---the same fibonacci of flowers against a
tangerine opacity---but let me not blame them for marveling at the
picturesque facets of nature, how they point their cameras westward
feebly, funny because it could not be helped. i can imagine how helpless
they must feel, unable to temper that desire to document all that is
beyond their hands, as most of the time, i feel that, too, when putting
to words my thoughts on certain aspects of living. humans can capture
through manic simulations that elusive beauty of nature, although our
copies only asymptotically arrive to what could qualify as good. give a
few more years, decades.

from our vista that is like no other, watch how bats flutter at the low
altitudes of the metropolitan squabble, and wonder, as we should, where
do they go to sleep? do they have caves here somewhere (perhaps, beneath
a footbridge) made out of guanos and stalactites? i'd like to see that---with you,
of course. i think of their migration from provinces to the
capital, clouds of them filling the skyline of roxas blvd. motorists
would stomp on their brakes, and cars would pile up from baywalk to
nowhere, all of them looking up at squeaking portents, flying bats.

in this note, i'd like to know if manileños are a curious lot? i mean,
to the point of giving in to the cessation, just to watch (with us, of
course) any motion of ill omen.

but we are too absorbed to be anything else. only seldom we focus.

cities are full of noise. never has telecommunication been so important.
white screeches and negative feedbacks, night lights blotting out the
stellar pyre: anti-magic in the form of hidden humanity, anti-motivation
in the form escapism. nonetheless, both cannot be heard nor seen, even
if one pays attention.

too much for too long, the blankness in expression expresses that much
diffidence pervading throughout the air, reaching zeniths, but not way,
way up and out. we nominate which of our scriptures would ascend in air
to be carried to places, the best breath we can part with the wind. it
is up to the newest methods we have at our disposal if such texts and
tones will land on their destinations. even then, we are barely
understood. as peers, we have been out of touch. as colleagues, we are
too arrogant in advertising ourselves. in the end, we wake up to the
same monotony that cannot be auto-tuned.

however, stay---for the vodka ever so vivifying; for the superlative
factors that we have yet to seek, many of which do not belong anywhere
and anywhen else but here and now. the future might not be as amazing as
it looks, and the past, despite my previous convolutions, apprehensive. i
hope we can visit soon a big observatory, that i can disprove myself
these allegations.

when i seek peace at the roundabout, i do not expect that something good
will come out of it. as a matter of fact, through the years, i have
leaned on an incline where bad outcomes outweigh the good. if a man
would jump out of a corner with an ice pick on his hand, then i know i
was not wrong in thinking of the lurking harm that riddles the unseen.

when i seek peace on my bed via slumber, then it is another experience
altogether. yes, it could feel swift, but it should not be as
detrimental a sensory as the one above.

it has been bothering me, however, for quite some time now, when the
solemn act of sleeping (alone on a wide bed, preferably) cuts into the
known dimensions of space. physically, it is not possible, or at least,
not yet to laymen. but that is what i hope to achieve: to rip through
the rift and jump to the morrow in the most efficient way. meaning,
arriving at point B from point A expending minimum effort. 

i lie there, eyes closed, illusions of time are chucked to the null. it
does not matter when i retire early or late at night. my body clock
wakes me up at the same hour: 10 AM.

time supposedly is a man-made abstraction, a term coined to describe the
passing duration; a word that tells something about an organism's age in
a language humans can understand; represented as *t* in calculations. if
i were to talk about the virtues of time, wouldn't it be just a waste of
it? but how can such non-material concept be wasted? most importantly,
did i oversleep again?

to transfer all the bile polluting the organ beneath the chest out of
the system; the fluid finds its way somewhere non-hepatic, somehow. to
transfer it all from the random sketches of envy and venom to the fangs
of a lower serpent, and out to the bunks of the underworld waiting, if
only that were anatomically possible.

i haven't been to an ocean's floor. more so, it is not dead. even more
so, it does not wish to receive my refuse, and at the same time, i don't
want a trace of humanity among its dark depths. and yet here i go,
casting now and casting more. every segment is an episode of quivering
motion. this is dilemma setting in. either that, or i, at this
unfortunate slice of moment, am too blind to see what is visible to
many, too dumb to derive a conclusion based on the provided evidence.
whichever holds true, and truth being one coming from a third neutral
perspective, for the time being, i assume the former.

i know what you (future-me) are thinking. you think i have overruled the
impossibility of mistake by disabling that which only mechanically
functions nowadays. then, you are wrong. your instructor, flawed and
hemispherical, does not benefit from the perverse discretion of
isolation. for all i know, it is a symptom. you are fermenting your own
in a vat, full to the brim with nothing but. 

it is fermented: the blaring news. and now you know.

...

gist in one question: how do i deal with such intemperance?

...

sometimes, i wonder if there's a benefit in addressing the current
problems to a person from a different spacetime, and if such benefit
would be immediately, effectively, noticed by the one who is babbling
(me). that no matter how hard i suppress dem feelz, they only flow in
every direction but inward. 

lo, this is another low, the newest actually, delivered unto me in a
quick fire through the account of a similarly aquatic drone, but under
no circumstance is it intentional. my part here is atlantic.

abundance of a source, as long as it is free and safe, is never the
subject nor the issue. you know how the
imps whisper into the ears of winos but not nibble at the rim of the ale
bottle? there are no 'dirty' things. there are only \'dirty' people.

someone once told me that a shot is enough to displace one's beliefs,
depending on the quality and content. i held on to this, although i've
never dreamed of evolving into an active bar brawler. i am a lever not a
fighter. by that, i mean i am more of finding leverage in other means
rather than submit my physique to a process of reduction. if, however,
the only way to deal with the situation is a hand-to-hand combat, i'd go
and give it my game.

the problem is, i seldom go to bars, because they are all filled with
noisy people. noisy people alone are fine, but noisy people quarantined
in the confines of alcohol -- that is a different brooding. i've seen in
those spaces how my contemporaries were bred further into bad
socialites. therefore, the chances of my hitchhiking onto a fist-fest
are slim. there in bars, my blood boils for some reason, my veins pop,
my teeth grind my teeth. this is unnatural. my temper is not usually
disorderly. besides, i am too broke to be wagging my tail bone
around, pretending i need new phone pals, because i don't.

i wheeze, but i strive to smile and be thoughtful. and my poor metallic
curse cures itself poorly; and that's how things are *here*.

the last time prior to checking out of a reggae bar, i stomped too hard
on the pedal of a bass drum. i questioned too why the featured bands
imitate a jamaican accent. one of them looked very oriental, his eyes,
and yet he formulated his voice to sound differently. *be yourself*, i
thought. amid the kung-fusion, i sat placidly with a free beer in hand.
who was i to contemplate?

friends let their friends get left behind, burning at ice palaces, not
looking back, apologies fleeing from the stares, for they have stolen
something they couldn't return, because they thought i had embarrassed
them. the only way to confront this was with a mild sedative.

nevertheless, my goodness is still in tact.

it might take me a long time to go again where the mass is happy while
the roads are splitting open, the ceilings ablaze with phosphorescence.
at some corners, there would be voyeurs asking for bruises in some
conduits, and accidentally eyeing on them makes me uncomfortable.

so, i've never been this eager to feel so mega after feeling so milli. i
try not to be impulsive.

it was almost an honest moon, stars striking our cordial conversation,
when the one-sided attraction lost my favors by a rub. i always kept a
fact sheet of data to present to a future ignominy, however unpromising
the fluctuations had been, to be as scientific as possible. but is it
really possible to be scientific in dealing with these kinds of things?

in many attempts, the prowess extraordinaire of the limbic system
transcends logic. this abstract made the scene serene, almost palpable.
somewhere were the lost pieces of fullness as evidenced by how the way
the lips once parted in marvel. all the data confirmed the sense that
both internal and external realities are amalgamated into a, usually,
post-nocturnal nicety---truly a far better embrace of *the* truth,

those you have hit will puke into the river below in agony. the river

anguish corrupts worse than any carnelian lethargy, but, as i have

thoughtless words, there is a chance to weaken altogether the sensation,
or at least turn some of it as excess heat. peering down on myself from
an altered perspective might sound obtrusive, but in examining why and

You define the counterargument for the stakes that firmly hold the
discipline (or the absence thereof) of being an urban crook. And this
without hesitation is my main absolution as to why am I in front of you,
kissing the gratitude onto your knees one small, dutiful peck at a time.
Maybe you would pat my forehead as if patronizing the humility of my
expression, but whether this will be the case, I have long since thrown
my speculations out the proverbial window; and I have since then assumed
that you must be a great thinker in the previous arrangement of your
very atoms, for you (and only you, of all the beings I have met) only
deflect any stimuli of hooligan-ness away from you with garlands and
grace. Personally, I don't think of it as a bad thing.

In time, everything will forge again routines, and those will break into

a rare phenomenon: a smart, ambitious dog igniting amid several knots
of mischief its curiosity one sniff at a time. for a species to evolve
into a self-destructive maniac like humans, it is deemed important to
have that drive to know more of oneself, one's surroundings, tools, the

i find the tactlessness of people out of time and out of place, since

among the weeks that have me anchored to a(nother) foreign house not

monotony. it sucks to be *and* not to be tethered to the webz,
especially when mad thoughts are flung my way for no good reason and
with no readily available medium to divert it to.

the old man comes
around for a drink, but i despise having to share a drink with him. he
gets too hyped and cannot control what he says and how he says them when
the spirits have come to meet him dizzy. last time, i just stared at the
night sky while he was babbling with his cheap principles, and i could
not even recognize the big dipper. the incandescence of street lamps
have washed the twinkles of stellar dots. being around this old man when
that happens is something i did not dream of.

speaking of dreams, i
dreamed of my brother the other night. he had shorter hair. he had
styled it so that the front bundle was spiked outwards. anyway, life
cannot conjure something from the shiftless.

Oh, weathered in the most natural position you can assume, epidermis
cawing for the monsoon. You court the dregs of precipitation before its
droplets even land on the garden.

Greetings from the light brown earth scorched under the gradual movement
of solar impatience. Light brown to dark. Dark brown to darker brown.
Like how it is in the early levels of Blendoku. The shades step down one
point from detachment, towards the pit.

Waking up to a body enfeebled during the wee hours of morning as if
sleep had become fatigue. Corpulent figures from dreamscape seem
augmented to fit the large space of imagination. Walking up the patio
and you find the door locked. Waking up to check your pocket if you had
the keys, only feeling stupid after reality had set in.

Dehydrated and weak and irritated by the blatant insinuations of
Belphegor, it that none of your delegates would want to know of. You
barely managed to pull yourself up and attend to your bodily needs. At
times like this, you wish there was an anatomical valet of sorts that
would carry off of you your piss and shit without you having to go to
the loo.

Consequently, your mind wanders to another unrelated idea: you think if
only you could pull your heart straight out of your chest without being
messy, and try to see if this tireless, selfless organ really is the
epitome of all that is, was, and will ever be romantic. No, it cannot
be. In a few forceful forthbringing to fruition, the day will have
reached its hottest. Smile because the time is not yet. Pull your eyes
shut again and sleep again.

This time, it is about your molar: it wiggles in its place, and you pull
it out of your gums. This tooth is habituated by larvae on the underside
of it. Waking up so anxious to mumble, "Oh the Anguish!" And so against
the mutiny of odds you proceed. You crush the joblessness behind a
skinny electronic with relative ease, only this time, you shuffle
between review materials and the cacophony of those two lovely hounds.
Blessed beings they are, might I add, although you wonder if they were
asking for a mild touch.

(Somewhere therein is a pause disguised as a sigh, a pause to be
grateful that it will soon be over.)

You are bored and you tell no one but the passers-by about it. And so,
out of the blue, you make up at least three stories to inconvenient
them, which are the following -- 

**One**: *My nana used to call me a constellation boy, and wow, how it
snacked on my being. There were instances that I would look into her
eyes, and would see mierda swirling through maelstrom. Apparently, my
back was perforated with scars from bed bugs and prepubescent zits. I
did not know how to deal with bed bugs and back acne at the time*. *I
beckoned the presence of a parent to tell off my nana, but no one came.
I don't blame her, though, my nana. My back was indeed a Picasso's
painting of pus.* 

**Two***: It is in looking inwardly that I visit the places I have never
been, or places that could never be. Imagination, although at best a
fickle aspect of the human condition, takes me anywhere. I hope I can
really travel soon, you know.* 

**Three**: *I once put my arm 'unknowingly' around the person I was
dating, and she told me that I was a Scam, that there is no such thing
as 'unknowingly' putting one's arm around the corporeal being of
another. I saw her smiling, though. Does that mean anything?*

---Such downpour of mad prose skills can flood España Blvd in seconds,
but to your dismay, none of them gives a damn about your orations, and
so you snap out of it. 

(Another pause. This time, covered in slumber.)

Waking up to an unknown rage seemingly so self-sufficient and
sycophantic that it takes only a few moments to figure out that there
sits a vermilion on the sclera of the mind's eye. 'Tis the weather again
you are rambling about. Well, it must be it.

Short stories of Borges did not help last night. Rain dance to the
melody of Alesana's *Ambrosia* did not help either. What could be that
one thing the might assist you in fending off the persistent tapping of
ennui and enigma? Eight glasses of water? Ten? No matter how hard you
wish for the sun to go away, it just won't. It stays in its rightful
place up in the sky, flashing. It makes you think: a prominence *is *the
sun's way of smiling. It makes you stutter. It blinds you of the
morrow.

i bide the rigors of impunity with the tempest of glance, but in accord
to that personal action which barely, if at all, alleviates the
pressure, i am aware of the recent "ghosts" assailing me at the dead of
night. however, i will only acknowledge them while they aren't here yet,
and in ambiguity.

forgive me cardiologists for i have sinned. it is not
a matter of health but the absence of it. it is not about the elements
of dissatisfaction that continuously edit into me how and why i may not
be going the right way, although that could fairly be overridden with
exercising the will. while the heart is overly stated in literary air
and in everyday blah for the wrong reasons (i think so), it is worth
noting of the real effects of human emotions upon it.

i did not know what to make of the situation, the postponed surprise for
people who initially said yes but in the end backed out, that in that
moment when i saw again him after many years, the celebrant's figure
shocked me. from 90 or so kilograms, he thinned down to 40-something in
a short period of time.

i remember him making fun of me because of my feral hair-do, suggesting
that i'm two white strands shy from being a 'dyslexic scientist'.

while whole point of this festivity is for him to regain his previous

his acute syndrome. i wish him well. i wish him...contentment.

sounds appealing, take it in, take it all in, every detail so long as it
harmonizes with the drive. it is too late.

i watched an orange decay rapidly as if it were on video time lapse---a

doing its carnival on the thing. in a matter of moments, it had lost its
orangeness and turned into something greige with fungi. i wondered what
it would taste like; so i put the specimen in my mouth and began
chewing. indeed it was chewy, like a gum, but lacking any recognizable
taste. when i spat it all out, to my horror, the pulp comprised---*again*---maggots.

Defect the cards on the coffee table that were once of immense value.
Being susceptible to differentiating values of blur and red, the cards
are now only a pile of pseudo-premonitions, because mysticism is an
ailment whose sole aim is to defy my own understanding of the
unfeathered logic and sound reasoning, a dagger inside the head of the
king of hearts. Abandon---yes, as you have always done, and today, I
won't blame you for getting lost in the tarot audience.

You have a nice-looking palm.

Leave before the seers foretell that I would be coiling over the same
lofty mattress, uttering the same chapbook stories from
abroad, thinking, maybe sneezing, or maybe wolfing down lines of tar
jutting up from my personal box.

But before you do, let me first close my eyes so it would be improbable

### Entry # 170
Date: Thu, 06 Nov 2014

the pursuit of contentment is still under construction. i am gaining
flabs on my abdomen. my face is starry with infectious dots, so
repulsive that i can't look at my bathroom reflection without plunging
further into darker depths. i might decide one morning to go for a
lengthy session of brisk walking, cut in front of aggressive drivers
just to have this habit of flipping them the bird, but i doubt all these
would be my saving grace.

life convulses around the corners of this
new edifice, still under construction; the sidewalk people below have
their arms above their heads as if those were enough to protect them
from falling debris. they wait in a long queue at a local grill joint.
we have been cynical towards others' perspectives as we way in line,
trying to enjoy the urban solitude---but how can we when all we do is
check up on our smartphones every few moments?

...

albeit torturous the recent disambiguation of myself might seem to *me*,
it would be absurd to actually think about it that way, to base the
morrow's lifetime regurgitation of the sound and senseless on that.

people become relentless when they attempt to disprove me that we are
impractical creatures. to them, it is about how one goes around the
corner (whatever that means). to me, it is largely how one distills the
water they are to drink (whatever that means). still---i wonder from my
concrete, linoleum-covered seat the muteness of employers and why they
haven't gotten to any of my applications yet.

*the world outside is built on confusion by confused people*: a
documentary of a person who almost marturbated his blues away.

...

dreaming of a certain person i had missed brings back the times of
adolescence, my bicycle days. certainly i must record this incident,
even through the pervading struggle of phantom mists, because it removed
me from the entanglement i was in the night before.

of course, it was of a female, now remodeled by starbucks "sophistry"
and maple cadence, but what can i say? i am glad that she is doing well,
and that her casting herself closer to contentment has delivered her
some deep insights about the meaning of existence. and k-pop. she still
bewitches even the most horrendous of men with her noble smile, in or
out of dreams.

i am hooked to the whir of urban traffic drama,
how extensively corrupt one plot can be,
as if watching a film critic defend its turf but never the essence of what is served.
and every time i see one,
i will ride it to the end.

one would notice various discrepancies offered within the arguments of both camps,
offender and defender,
although one might not have rigid constructs of basic street-smarts.

it is obvious: emotions reduce our ability to reason.
these drivers decline open-mindedness.
maybe it was not taught in their school (or anywhere else for that
matter), but it only takes two reckless people to have an accident.

every instance i see leaves an odd spectrum on my overall personality,
that which is sometimes mildly savage, oft cavernous as it tunnels
through the psyche.

### Entry # 174: *friendships among netizens, and the unusual discord that follows*
Date: Wed, 19 Nov 2014

downright agitating---and the agitation remains exclusively malignant
where an epidermis must be---but promising: future friendships arising
from cybernetic origins might soften the blow of the lasting
preoccupation of the bruised genitalia and immobilized alter egos.
sometimes, in order to participate in this growing bubble, there needs
to be a certain balance of confidence and diffidence, to give and to
take either/or. kind of like maintaining the right pH level in a pool.

to be more unofficial about this, let me tell you what i think, so you
can pass this around like it's hot shit:
in many instances, a person
conducting an in-depth meditation on what good things are there to say,
he or she reanimates premeditated gabs and combines them in a particular
sequence such that it makes no sense yet can baffle others. to establish
this sense of being, one is willing to garble on fart-thoughts to win a
stranger's approval. sometimes, this does not work out.

amid the distances, one imagines tentatively the benefits; and it is
during this quest for conformity that hormones quiz the will if or not
it could pass the industrial standards. if we set up rules on which this
late-night hip would stand, the morning shall come as menacing as the
first rays of sunlight piercing the eyelids. by then, adults would be up
to cook the first meal of the day (supposedly). or, they would wander by
your room and hear the audible commotions transpiring behind the door.
have you forgotten that the earphones you bought last week was
inexpensive and therefore below normal. it has been emitting excess
decibels outward to your room and further past your door and---look,
your parent has opened your door.

"did you even sleep?" asks your parent.

you are taken aback. a glimpse into the future tells you that this might
mean you would be grounded for the next two lifetimes if you're lucky.
no time to evaluate the situation. this is worse than the happening. if
there is a solution, it needs to barge in right now and take you away
from this in a blink.

the laptop beeps and then darkens as it discharges the last of its
energy before dying off. *pariah*, the air whispers, *you now drink your
snot of a fitting dose---deal with it*.

the curtains fall abruptly as
the reader now proceeds to question the essence of bonds fortified
within a hazy reality created by superficial creatures *for* other
superficial creatures.

a neighbro[^neighbro] measures the time it takes for an average person to
ponder upon this and formulate their own useless posits to be submitted
next, next, ... , next tuesday.

to which worldly substance does an applicant need to ascribe the
unnecessarily talkative mouth of an interviewer?

does the interviewer shuffle through the mess of her family when she gets home?

does my not conforming to the latest trends of fashion insult her \#ootd, even
mildly?

i don't understand these kind of people, but it seems i would be
dealing with them soon enough.

the length of makati avenue is full of filth, occasional vice-grips
(like i am) who have to meddle with the metaphors of possible employers
before getting ignored at the end of the day. elevators have shiny
metals for walls, and inside is where somebody reflects before expelling
a gust of afternoon breath. i must be exhausted.

so instead of me complaining further, let me tell you something funny i
heard on the street: a guy went to a casino to have some wild night.
[*and then what?*] he approached a table of some betting game and
placed a mental bet, since he did not want to get too involved. [*then

### Entry # 176: *venting, or so it says*
Date: Mon, 01 Dec 2014

i am everywhere... i am everywhere an orphan of yet another dysfunctional
family. i tend to gravitate towards households that concern its tenants
with familial mishaps. sometimes, the feeling of isolation cannot be
prohibited, unless i am preoccupied with two playful poodles. (i am
thinking of attaching at least a photograph of each dog, but that's
extra labor.) that is why...

this house has been accepting lady bedspacers, but the slots are
currently full. one of the ladies thought it funny to start calling me
'baby' or 'sweetheart', even though we both know no spark will come out.
if anything confuses me
of the totality of the west, it's the hardening of impulses and,
thus, preventive releasing of tension towards humorous housemates.

perhaps, it is a joke she shares with the landlady, or her own way of
introducing herself to a malignant cyst (ahem) throbbing usually
silently on a chair (ahem). i don't usually respond to this, but when i
do, it's with a sarcastic half smile. for once, i thought this
involvement of words of endearment to hopefully establish rapport is
kind of sad, but the thought quickly passed as i rubbed my forehead with
a wet pillow.

some masculine person with a darkened skin is the headhunter. his
partner has a child with another man whom i have never met. this kid is
peculiar, but not as peculiar as i am in most social aspects. this kid
is 25 years old, still schooling. feels no shame nor guilt, even as he
errs. the landlady must have spoiled him. in any case, this point in
time has been a weird ride in a 14-year-old sports car with this family.
at least---

i am always present... i am always presented to the structures of society
that has been misinformed for decades. media do not help. or maybe they
do, but in other ways that favor them.

the sad part about it is, i can't do much to make a change.
nobody quickly shifts into a position
where one can do superhuman alterations. no one can be as grand as that.
let it be known then that everywhere i go, i see to it that i try to be
as invisible as possible.

in the past few days, i have had dancing thoughts about people going
about their routines. an old man told me of the proud things he had
achieved when he was in college. it went on for days, his storytelling.
he could not be stopped, not even with a too-good-to-be-true nod. his
declamation almost always bored me every time his former glory came up
at the dinner table. almost always, i let him vent. the pressure must
have been too great for him to contain, and since the kid of his partner
he could not rely on to share his personal thoughts with, i took it as
task to be an absorber. a listener. a spongebob squared to the pants.

i guess in expecting it to die down to a more subtle state, the
involuntary wobble of human tissues, after all, shall not be muted just
because an external null entity is so fed up with repetitive envious
accounts.

fresh grads opting for entry level positions cannot haggle their
desired salary with the one in charge.
at this stage in their career, the employers choose.
and in order to be singled out from others, you, the applicant,
improve the credentials, which you might find a bit troubling since you have
little to no experience to brag about.

then, you---choose to hide underneath layers of comfort to confront the adversaries that are
mashing elevator buttons for fun. elevator rides become more dizzying
every time. whose giant's head must you spit on because of this
invention? hide on the thirteenth floor in your fuschia flannel. avoid
ghosts and their hands. avoid intriguing questions. avoid stupid
inquirers asking you, "why are you sniffing the pages of the book?"
although by then, you cannot help but think, "isn't it imperative to do
such?"

you see, i had in me a mental book about life and how often it is
plagiarized and other facets of diarrhea that are obviously manufactured
by an empty mind; and i was mentally reading it. a woman in corporate
attire noticed. why was i sniffing the pages? a bit odd, no? so i guess,
it wasn't that dumb a question.

i sought solace to compromise my nostalgia with nasty pulp reads whilst
caffeine-stoked. i detoured my duties away from the sleazed up nooks of
mabini, all the while puffing the air that sits by the nostrils. unless
you look important, nobody here will give any drag about how you tremble
to your appendages.

meanwhile, the complainants of the year, the decembrists, have a lot of
lists to publish, mostly typewritten at the back of a coffee shop
receipt. what's more odd, though, is the smell of their smegma caked
just around the eyes, and judging from the looks of it, i need not bring
my nose any closer to know they've been veering from happy thoughts all
night.

my stomach awakens its beast. can't i just ward the hunger off, or must
i get up and scour for change in pockets even when i know there is none?

if it were possible to determine---whether through telepathy or superior

it would be a lottery, though.

of unlikely odds declining humanistic stupidity
(sometimes abbreviated as 'wish').

because there's nothing more
exasperating than getting caught within the vicinity of lover's quarrel.
because the tension is beyond me to manipulate; that is, i hate
intervening. because i don't want to hear arguments from either sides,
knowing full well they would crash on their own bottomlessness. i
suppose such wishful thinking can only come true had there been a glitch

oldster in a warehouse of misguided colleagues:

it could be distracting to isolate this deflated ego.
necessary, nonetheless.

he speaks of sociopathic tendencies a non-conformist may have
as he gazes into me, as if searching for clues.
what can i do?
is there something to be done?
a wolf lost amid the disconcert of trees,
their rustling leaves barely guide this furry one away from fire.

and then the stairs would thunder from the hit of footsteps---someone
is coming down. a savior? someone to pull me from this awkward convo?
or need i excuse myself?
clocks seem bored.
the tables.
anything that has been absorbing the details of this debate would have grooves on its surface.
interestingly, no phonograph that can be mounted with narra tablets has been invented yet.

still, i commute towards the front of the store.
someone with short hair passes by but comes back to take a second look.
we exchanged words of humility and kindness.
i know i can never jump to her level,
but you know what, a dude like me has nothing to lose...

the night often beckons my presence.
i am theirs to be shifted.
i wait my avalon to drift me from the haughty perversions of nails as the last
drop of brandy-ice mix paves way to muchness, while i recover from the
stitches, while a new pen forges through the woods. but in reality, it
is the bladder that begs to be emptied. sometimes, deliberately, i get
back to sleep, certain that i have forgotten a wonderful dream before
having the chance to jot it down with a song that curbs the feels 180
degrees. like giving a dog a bath that it always is a drag.

a small poodle in heat that i must always jerk with four fingers on his
side picks himself up to climb up my knees and, with oblivious pupils,
seeks affection. pets have their way of making themselves needed to be
kneaded. greyish muons traverse in a certain frequency before retinas
are able to process them and relay the data to the main processor. they
say that knowing is scraping any artistic value without aesthetics, but
is that possible? to assign light over the dimness of creation? in order
to evaluate a stimulus, it requires a good working rubric, many of
which, if not really that scholastic the subject, are derived from

besides, i don't have the right to interfere between the unspoken discussions of two grown-ups living

i haven't been told the details,

do you ever feel like you've been sitting on a cliff,
watching the breakfast flock go about their itinerary just a few skies from your
point,
when amid fantastic solitude an imp appears from nowhere and
whispers unto thee to try free falling?
you say no to its persistence.

the soft slap of a palm on your forehead does not convince the visitor.
it belongs from within you and that a mediocre push-away sets not off its nagging mood.
and insists on you pursuing this malicious endeavor for no reason, to fall into the depths below. you try
to ignore him because your intent is simple: to watch the flock fly. and

you wonder now how it feels to soar with wings. the cliff is high, you
see; and the lunch is still a few good albums away. you are now

lying in the lower bunk has its *-isms* for me to think about.
as inexpensive as it sounds,
casually snapping my fingers to the buzz of jitters not really is la vie en rose that fixes this natural game of
waiting for the fall of ripe aching upon the bored being.
i root for something else.

everybody is in their position,
and from this point forth,
no one would be bothering me as i rest and look up for a pseudo-skyline.
let the brother confuse himself by the machine he condemns;
let the sister screech at him because his temper smashes the mouse,
which is outright stupid.
and so i accept the wantons of daily provisions:
they are beyond my mugging.

sometimes, when i get too quiet, a sibling would look over their
shoulder to check up on me.
and they would catch me staring upwards sans electronics at hand.
how craggy the mind can get,
originally beseeching a posh scent from the past to stimulate perception,
although the eye gazes at woes dimensional,
and dead becomes it.

i have my realities sorted and filed,
always ready for me-times like this, yet people always
try to bring me back to the one that best suits their lifestyles.
they classlessly accuse me of being a daydreamer,
but i'd rather be that than exclaim every once in a while a broken cuss for the hungry and poor.

i notice, then, some sort of writing, done as if by fevered hands,
or someone with unintelligible qualms.
it is written on a cardboard that was placed underneath the mattress of the top bunk.
"auntie pura was here,"
squiggled awfully in rotating lines,
and it appeared to have been done on purpose.

but what is the purpose?
the name to which the endearment belonged has long been dead.
it could be, therefore, a prank
by a misfit with nothing better to do.
here, he thought of 300 dying
people's parting displays of annoyance for the world,
reduced merely to four words.
sadness and sickness go skinny: structures of the passing
minds, if inked, look doped on cardboard.

first, an indiscernible figurine that walked against light
the source of light---an
incandescent ode to dancing in yellow shame atop a wicked
wax---abruptly shifted towards the observer and displaced itself behind him.
this, thus, seized a vivid image of the figurine:
some petite lady in dandelion shirt,
all noble as basked she in the idea of slow walk...

i will now slight you with a list of notes that i have intended for the
subject flora of the previous garbage paragraph.
i do hope that you'd assume now a more malevolent attitude towards reading this personal
matter.

1.  in submitting to the grips and grabs of a foreign blizzard, i have
    failed myself to put back this intermittent commotion to nether
    past. what frustrations stir the blood cannot be put into words; and so in the interest of 'fresh start', i will try to follow a diagram, one that is as basic as
    lye and as equally damning to human skin, which i doubt i can
    follow.
2.  i assume that this will be a perpetual haunting of illusions that
    the subconscious could not let go. the practice of abolishing you
    from the furnace of time-long-gone demands disciplinary diving
    towards the parabolic vertex of all cosmic processes.
3.  other arguments will rise with your next apparition, of this i am
    sure. and the images will be more crisp as they present themselves
    in slideshow form. must i resist.
4.  i refuse to disengage from the inviting dullness of television. this

lilt sometimes condones that often grizzly obstruction of a solitude
twisted.
the rise and fall of enthusiasm was okay.
there were days that i thought i could accomplish many things.
but it was the subsequent fall,
from which i could no longer ascend,
that nearly defeated the purpose of my then-thesis;
and minus that needed push from my colleagues
at the time, the energy i required to at least finish this main task
with grace depleted gradually.
the paper became a heap of indiscriminate
use of phrases and adjectives *\*ahem\** that would only bear meaning if
the whole mess was to be thrown into the smirking bowels of typhoon.

i don't know if it was just a phase,
or i was just too saturated
by the commotions amounting to five years worth of intellectual bullshitry.

believe me when i tell you this:
i almost did not make it to the finals.

some days, i grew up.
some days, i just grew old.
life does not necessarily have to be so profound all the time,
but i could not carry the weight of being in such a low point that even i have
failed to describe understandably.

i was nearing my graduation,
and to be honest,
the renewal of year seemed to have renewed my tardiness.
huge chunk of it had been spent looking out the window,
perturbed by a dilemma of whether or not i would go to school.
in the days that i did not, i made a 500-word-or-less reflection why,
and posted some of it, edited here on tumblr.

there are many things about perfectionism.
for me, it's about how a journey is processed carefully through the lens of human sensibilities;
that asymptotic arrival towards one's ideals,
almost hitting the ceiling (if you aim high). for me, too, it's the opposite of what i had experienced: it's
about how i negated duties, and in turn, i had been the subject of my
own anomaly, as i metaphorically lie on a floor to think about the why's
of why's.

i took a few pictures of myself in that black gown to remember the stuff
i really do not want to remember.

in the fluids heaving there comes the manifestation of poverty,
arguably a messy by-product from the previous night's partaking of dinner.
the colossal bit that i ingested as substitute for temporary satisfaction
birthed seemingly new species of microorganisms in my stomach.
gluttony crafts special repercussions for the sorts who devour mindlessly through
cobwebby viands.
and now i feel arachnids terraforming my insides.
is that normal?

aptly, must i recall now:
i ate the mid-section of the fish;
a tall guy ate the head part,
quite particular on not missing the eyes;
sister munched on the tail section;
and who ate what.

the servings came in calculated proportions;
however, the calculating process always is in need of stitches.
the knife chopped through and across,
doing away equal divisions,
because who needs equality when you're boiling with dysphoria.

midnight hallucination usually suffers in rarity if you're not sober or
far from being afflicted by residual disinclination for vanity and
get-rich-quick schemes.
sometimes, in order to dream big,
one must have read several artsy textbooks on decadence,
however atavistic its philosophies may be.

in my case, having no dreams it reduces the chance of me getting a complete sleep.
i am shocked by the passive creativity fed to me in prim intervals,
more obvious when i'm not aware of it.
these hallucinations fuel my, uh, creativity.
but before i digress,
the more important thing here is:
the guts part, in much postulating, did this to me.

i awoke from a rowdy rest of rolling into an urge to visit the
porcelain, which, in this apartment complex, is situated outside the
flat and is shared with other tenants. trysts, or their bastardized
versions, howled from the inside of one of the cubicles, like the sound
of felines fighting for scraps at night. i could not press on during
this period. i was a swelling bladder. i was digestion mutiny, sleep
deprived, restlessly overusing olfactory nerves to separate the good
smell from the bad.

i remembered the stories of Poe, vanilla horrifying and tiresome, still
teasingly haunting me with the image of that one black cat.

as for regulating the movement, i would not so much as walk a step
further into the yellow palls that divide the causeway and cubicles,
simply because of few distorted frequencies misplaced in air, misheard
in ear. maybe the candor air startled me with its din; or the thunderous
bang of door failing by one of its hinges reminding me of its much
needed repair; or maybe the sound of what i thought were cats.
whatever---but the unknown always insists to instill a fizz beyond our working
knowledge. the unknown is always steps ahead.

how one morning sounded like doubts unfurling on the yodels of chest,
and to refuse to acknowledge its presence gives me something to do.

"a coin comes from many miraculous events," thought the guy.

an iron knob screeched counter-clockwise as friction proved to be more
than just a thing. the shower spurted a few sprays before coming to
malfunction; it was dead again, and someone from the housemates must
have emptied the bottle of shampoo in the toilet. although, now, in
honesty, there is no shower. there is only the faucet and the rusty iron
wires that hold it in place against the wall.

> "the history of coins extends from ancient times to the present, and

nevertheless, in this idle time, he mused on some topics that have been
proven invaluable to human existence.

it was his time of self-love.
too, it was the time of bathing, and in
bathing one can accomplish an array of activities. at one moment, this
guy that i am talking about soared an intestinal road of a vast foreign
land without having him leave the definite coziness of shower room. at
another, he recited in multiple languages the lyrics of that one pop
song he despised. the problem was, he knows only two languages. 

today, he saw a coin. what of it, then? and he stumbled upon that lost
coin on the soap rack, now pinkish as it was smudged into an ugly shape.
he thought of coughing up a proper essay about coins, but first, he must
rub himself with that pink soap and wish away either apathy or stretch
marks, whichever is easier to deal with.

when everybody knocks off their heads onto a soft pillow, when lights
are put out and the light emissions themselves cease to flicker, what
prayers have you to utter to shield yourself from yourself against a
foreboding corrosion of broods, that this is just an ordinary episode of
loneliness, solvable, measurable? that it isn't deep enough to reach the
network of graft beneath this place our own? that when you come again
'here' 'right now', everything will calm you, and you will no longer
feel anxious about whichever way the river flows? perhaps, you are
patient in your working out a proper sentence for the current to carry,
one so potent structure- and substance-wise that it is immune to the
mocking of agnostic sputum.

...

more and more the penance is becoming vibrant in coming up with
excuses to explain its being.
now, it must be proven---or rather, i
must prove---that it is for the better.

...

don't you think that postmodern gibberish ousts even the chicest essays
about romance ever penned? i do, sometimes; but not because i myself
*try* to practice blandly this approach in my style with words. i simply
think there are other ways in professing one's adoration for that
special somebody one cannot in any thread of fate pinch, without ever
having to tackle the essence. this unpopular notion leads me to believe
that, should i ever publish a book, only a handful (if i'm that lucky)
would every buy and read them. out of those, only one might like it (i
am looking at you, ma; be proud of your son). and same goes for my
contemplation on filmmaking---no, i don't think i can make it work that
way.

...

black-and-white films from previous decades give me a hint of how a
fraction of perceived reality could be distorted. exactly like a dream,
but more fictitious.

...

in godard's *vivre sa vie*
(viewed best, may i include, only in french tongue and verbosity from first scene to fin),
it was not explained openly how and why nana, the main character, became a prostitute. susan
sontag wasn't so sure either. well, she said, "Godard's films are
particularly directed toward proof, rather than analysis. *Vivre Sa Vie*
is an exhibit, a demonstration. It shows that something happened, not
why it happened. It exposes the inexorability of an event."

...

whatever it lacks in the sense department (to me), it compensates for
the wonderful tunes that accompany the images. i have yet to do some
looking up on titles of those tracks, as i hope soon to extend the list
of marvels in my music library.

...

it could be that this jean-luc wanted the viewers to arrive at different
conclusions, giving the story a more pitchfork dynamics.

...

it is everything 'art' in the fair game of naught and all and whatever
values there are in between.

...

serve into mind again the rants of that one huge man i so codenamed vito
here. done? good. the wide vicinity of his mind remains detach from
films hailing from countries that are neither filipinx or american.
going on from this point, is it assumptive of me to conclude that he
might not want to probe the multi-billion permutations of art?

...

but art releases; it imprisons; it invokes familial hurt, a redness
along the banks of sclera, akin to imagined lamentations a relative
might have caused; it is a series of patterns swaying with the artist's
feelz, be it contemporary or something as neolithic as granite; it is a
word repeated over and over again until it loses its original meaning;
art is *it.*

...

it's a good thing, i guess, that in the second house there is no
internet connection. i fear that the moment they call the linemen to
install one, i'd be live-tweeting about every black-and-white movie i
see on cable channels.

...

my guess is, it would be chunks and chunks of lazy analyses underscoring
the parts that could only serve me and my purposes. my attempts at
astute remarks regarding said films---140 characters tops per woe---i
imagine, would be lost in a timeline devoid of cohesion, unless recalled
in such a fashion that they, when summoned all together, would arrange
themselves in a neat fix. still, without doubt, each tweet would breeze
by on unknowing fellows. however, on a slim chance that someone would
opt to interact with them, methinks it be worded thusly: "@iooare stop
livetweeting hbo ffs!"

...

the look upon the sky could not be perceived as an exact veneer of crude
oil except with decay of facial flesh on a previous thursday that,
as usual, came and vvent:
an evening full of hopes, only to be dotted by
statements going beyond morale, and the feeling one could feel a little
less like slush rolling and tumbling in that metal container, lights
a-blipping.

ferdie helped himself with a beer, and so did we.
this was over the bay, where sundry of silica flowed uncensored to the peeled
eyes of men, most of whom were balding decrepits. there the sounds of
brass and electronica humped together to make a noise akin to the talent
of katy perry.

i should have known that i could not expect any good
here, even from the guys who dragged me.

i had then a twitching edge;
i didn't imagine this experience to be caustic to the virginal sense---this menial side of paradise,
this smoking zone dark as soot, only
serving as a stopover for crooks who dupe themselves with light before
plunging altogether to the chants of unholy hours.

"i finally saw this post again!" said the loco tumblrite. the moments
wasted on scourging through this unknown were met with the asymmetry of
astonishment. if it were of the good type or bad, i will not tell. but
such was a progression of moments from one beat leading to the next.

he rushed up to examine the post, its authenticity versus the last time
he saw it, which was not that long ago. his breath, nearly depleted,
remained excitable, because who knew this would happen---this
seemingly sick humor parted unto his essence by forces ethereal,
unforgiving---again?

it was a street lamp post.

you see, he was fanning through the contents of his fast-paced
dashboard, reblogging text posts from a user---all the while walking
blindly.

he had been lost for about an hour now, and he wouldn't have noticed it
until he finally looked up and checked what the eerie silence was about.
and there stood lonely a street lamp post, its orange beam barely
radiant against this nightly backdrop. nobody around, not an ether nor
wisp. only multitudes of trees several meters from him on both sides,
posturing themselves intimidatingly as a reminder for him not to go
deeper into them. but into them he went anyway. he couldn't think of any
part of the city where trees bloomed lush yet with dark motivations,
that is, if indeed he were still in *a* city.

> *ok but platonic forehead

the surge either made his shouting too vehement or made his larynx
unresponsive. whatever the case, the trees proved to be misleading
throughout this curious case of dejection. he did not know that his not
tapping to the commotion of subconscious wits was causing him to
circumnavigate this ghost-place. alas, back he was, to this spot where a
light-emitting mad lamp waited---for him, it seemed.

everybody has their eyeballs sheening as they shed the softer, outer
shells inwardly without making a fuss of it at the heart of a city.

everyone practices stereognosis inside the jingling confines of pockets
and/or purses, as if to show others how hip they look, which, of
course, is just another contrast of how they really are. and through the
tunnels of head, a jittery song plays them apart: a popular message to
shepherd them into a flash mob of mambo.

there is no shelter against this;
everybody is bound to be infected.
and through the myopic complex conduiting an individual to another,
the song stammers with the
malleable memento to be imparted as a "unique part of me that i am
willing to share".

does this song pull out a piece from a person, and
everyone gladly partakes in it?

everybody crumbles patiently inside
themselves, and it brings on them the needed jumpstart to topple the
dominoes of convulsing greed for anger-turned-tears or dysfunction as a
general trait of being parvenu.

and then, there are annotations brewing---of the same suspicious minds that just won't quit on giving up.
the strength. the endurance. and behind it, the fad. the magic. no more is
there sameness in circles with which everyone draws their overlapping
charts; only similarly shaped couture that, if placed adjacent to one
another, the body would correspond to machine, and the mind to the
terabytes announcing themselves properly working.

*"why is it not funny for a mathematician to do drugs?"*

the last time he was this anxious was the first day after the pupil died
of sadness under his watch. it has been about a month now, and the
geometry teacher is reeling back from his comforts. he feels especially
down today. what of self-forgiving trait and its biting tendencies
against hope?

good thing this saturday blows temperate winds, to calm his finicky
requirements, although it is debatable still whether they want to be
calmed. another good thing: he wouldn't have to worry about teaching
kids their proving lessons. not that the order would have allowed him
inside the school premises this time of the year or ever. or any other
institution for that matter.

he grabs a small bag of salt-appearing powder that he shopped from a
spooky meat the other evening. a narra table at the center of his office
waits for him to prep his line on it. he fishes his kit from a drawer
and starts to assemble his little event. 

something snaps in him and he descends from his anxiety to the forlorn
depths of psyche.

beautifully deceased flora left at my plate bloomed at the afterlife.
a zest of lemon to feel clean while knowingly you cling to the scent.

in the shedding of veiny antlers, or, lo, the weary eyes of men,
evidence of majesty is nothing.
i mean, the excessive malfunction of an apologia by the agents of plants.

nature must have been working overtime to even stand the gnawing confusion.
do you fight when jaws are fangs-deep in your throat?
do you seek vengeance?

i am on a playground in a purgatory plaza.
i am with gout and a messy tuft.
feeling spiritual me, sounding
like a creepy-crawly inflection; i shine inward. my leisure is to warp
the trees to my whim.

i am a hare disadvantged, hare traversing uphill
against a sky full of hungry eagles.
i am a goose beside a friend.
the light rays freely tamper the insides of translucent spores and lush vegetation.

to be unable to cry in a funeral parlor, because to cry means very
little to the ones too far from heart;

to be warmed up only by peanuts and other fingers; to drink the stalest
coffee and imagine the marquee of heavens;

to laugh at a grandmother who impulse-bought a coffin for herself;

the tragedy, for me, is missing the chance to know these dead people
better, to blame the slow forward motion of arrows that delayed me to
summon myself in this leveled existence; and not death itself;

the tragedy, for me, is to know only the good memories from bereaved
relatives, and not of blocked-out bad versions;

the dead in his casket surrounded only by misty eyes of others and their
fondness of him;

my whistling *rock tha house* through the vacant halls to feel
something;

a planetary woman mistaking me as a love interest, only to abate her
desires after telling her i am a family relative;

to see how a daughter aches behind the shades; to feel how stoned she
must be;

my companions did not let me hold the wheels.

dear, a tuesday fellow sought in his tongue to pressure me with the
prospects of rising from the rashes. i had to held back joints to launch
his throat; acting on it would only provoke the man, worsening my
situation.

"what are you doing with your life?" he asked.

i explained how my undergoings proceeded down the void, though would he
hear any of it? this for him always outweighs the reality until its very
defining part suits the purposes of his last few neurons.

the way he speaks has always been condescending, so much so that
tolerating any din he regurgitates is difficult. this is the problem, i
think, and not me. his willingness to pull down people to his standards.

indeed, the guy lives a difficult life. he continues not to divorce
himself from the mock complexity of ancient rites.

instead of instigating rave, the stock response was to shut him out of
my new wave yodel and let his old bones be. meanwhile, i regret having
to hold back this little could-have-been monologue:

to dismiss the infernal luxury of universal entities tugging at limbs
and hacking into fields commends only so much kudos, if not
*the* salvation, of the placid of wills. things do find ways to test
entropic processes, whether a certain one is fixed by the aesthetics au
naturel; but in order to place objects, living or otherwise, in
locations that would be least aggressive with the shifts of forces, one
is bound to commit to the syntax. else, wade with a chosen group of
spirits.

our functions are our own, that i'd like to believe. however, in
instances within which i am involved, even indirectly, i see to it that
my next course of action enables the unraveling of coils to intercept
any predetermined claims, and ultimately convert such into conditions to
foster even the most basic mores.

we overestimate ourselves through our cartoonish interconnections, here
and out there.

the solid base on which we ground our footing is vitalized by the sump
system of the floors above the heads. that is not to say that a
character glued here cannot pull their body to a comfortable wrung, but
to do so requires, evidently, a serious inkling towards detachment from
the abrasive taste of elite, albeit the natural response is to initially
seek stability.

regardless of stimulus, whether perverse or otherwise,
our ilk, being social creatures, tend to situate themselves alongside a
trend. and nowadays, trends often promote the former.

the dilemma to be seen here needs people to comprehend that while, yes, it is okay to be
part of the accepting crowd, their behavior should transcend from time
to time a little beyond the fundamentals.
however, that's not to say that we only get by on stuffing our cranial compartments with cheap
sophistication, since it is impossible to live on abstracts alone...

when a tercentennial grudge made port from europe, some of the
indigenous people already surmised the vehemence behind the (un)godly
hue of blanche that was, and still is, as cunning as its con. we must
deal then with the predicaments of reality. it takes a bit of effort to
rattle the head away from papal incantations that would only make

anywhere a certain type---for there are many types outside of science
and art,
although many of which poses minimal credibility---of
*gravity* mechanizes the cathodic riffraff of capital punishments.

i went to my annual graveyard shift and there i saw a growing shrub from
out the crack of a femur.
why this particular thigh bone was not in its tomb i knew not.
the mystery, however, lay not on the bone alone, but
also on how a green thingy could thrive from the lack of nutrients
therein. were there generations that skipped altogether the maneuvering
of evolution, only to emerge much, much later in tragic-stricken
provinces?

a few woofs of rookie ligament-consuming deferred and discarded
seemingly attempting to snap me out of my job?
no.
i knew better.
if ever supernatural workings were to clef my logic,
that must be, like,
super-duper-wooper-natural.

an army of fire ants disappeared marrow-ward,
where rings patiently retraced the lineage.
the swarm marched forth like a red lightning
whipping the sides of spruce,
originating from the hollows below to the nether spaces.
i grubbed my supper and observed the unfolding:

arthropod trunk yearned for morning light, but it was still hours away from dawn.
i left my waste beside me and procured from my knapsack a flashlight.
something about this awful plant was magnetizing.
its starch-like color, instead of a shade of verdant, emitted a boiling
stench similar from months-old stew buried meters deep beneath a rotten
beach. the branches formed a cage that housed a beat-up stache -- only
at closer look did i see its spine, calcified, with leaves poised to
catch the lower jaw. stars would fit in eye pockets had they been rid of
fruit maggots.

hour 3---paler and paler went stroke of beams onto openings. this very
sentinel, its entire architecture that was gothic by design yet
deceiving by nature, marveled the disconcert in my pupils, while i in
turn saw nothing in its, save for the damnation imminent.

hour 6---against the glint of vision, its body, almost phosphorous
then but when red vines began choking the plant, swelled now for the
vapors escaping me. do you ever wonder why plants behave different from
us? hasn't that always been the case? i wrestled with my idle thoughts
on my final hour, and the young now-tree seemed to pull its roots from
earth. i sat on my butt as it approached me slower yet closer. for a
moment, it placed a balete hand on my right thigh, the etudes shortly
cut the scene.

a mourning followed my wake;
a few woods of life roll deep into dirt.
the city on fire---from the rubble columns of clay sprout.
new cavities blossom on my shift for the next intern to record.

i was a bum (which i find almost prophetic),
and sleep or rest had me arrested in front of a beauty parlor.
a man approached the parlor, seemingly with something bad going on upstairs,
as evident by the way he strode forward. what stirred me alert was, when
upon examination, in his right hand he gripped a pistol. he noticed my
getting up, and, perhaps afraid of my unveiling his evil, he turned to
me and shot three bullets across my collarbone, much like an ellipsis
and the pause it offers. never have i convinced myself to wake up so

the credentials of a friend remains refutable when their suggestive
pessimism knocks the jenga blocks and makes a song out of the debris.

take ecclesiastes for example: how his virulent tongue did not spare a
page (or *so*) inside the divine text as he included his fascination on
running after the moving air, and then saying how it was *all* useless
to him. i guess, my friend, the same thing goes for me.

only when the faint gleam of reflected sunlight at night obliges itself
of touching the sublime crevices of the hypothetical mind frame will you
learn of my dishonesty towards the way the chef prepares any supper for
me. that to me it is impossible to consume, as i myself am inside a
really bad vortex of consumption.

every movement feels slow. i stretch
my body over the strong traction of dirt;
and a hundred slugs swarm
inside my hungered mouth,
their slime wronging local cavities.

time now. that is the proper way to gain a friend but lose a limb.

the promise of sad pop love songs, however uninventive their promises to
fix, lasts more than eight hours, more than enough for a hundred
restroom round trips, in which the final cubicle at the far end is not
reached by visible light, perfect for checking social media accounts
that are far better on patching up holes.

except during the inert hours when the sun sits godly at zenith,
bonifacio global city (aptly shortened to 'BGC'), despite how it
condescendingly approximates wayward wallets, is not so bad a place to
meet dark-lipped by-passers with whom one could share a moment of
silence.

the kind of love we know,
which to the untrained nerve bundles is immune to defiant tissues,
posthumously sprouts from the desultory of vanity.

the plight of mental sacs,
as they inwardly project menial staccatos of gyrating imagined mouth-to-mouth conversations,
inconvenience my punching the jaw off of its fixation.

o the things that come when i am idle!
i could star on the next sofia coppola film if it weren't for the
lack of dullness in my hair and skin.

one thing, though: i don't trust
my *kagwapuhan* enough to ensure me a slot in the limelight.
not that i showcase any to start off.
*kagaguhan siguro, oui...*

...perhaps the ill-conditioning of proverbial stiffness---a
contrathetical manifestation of some moldy levite code---attests as to
how i am enslaved by the late, late reckons of the same frame yet of a
mythical chamois variant.

hello, you, down there.
are you feeling especially downcast this time?

on some occasions i delight on the crash-course cleansing of being,

a classless zymurgy of the lovely breakup aftermath, coupled with
cognitive mapping that bears some semblance to that movie about wanting
to erase someone from memory's form, zooms in on the restlessly
anticipating vito and his pursuit of one lani. as the mushiness of
tenderloins transsubstantiate into a woeful shell, the man decided that
i be his wingman (*coughs*), one who regularly checks the evolution of
the second chin (*coughs*); the minimum-wage supporting actor; me the
minion.

i can hear through the creaks of gate how the woman sighs intensely. her
son---not vito's btw but of another faceless,
indifferent guy---becomes increasingly prejudiced by the reappearing of the man who once
almost anthologized the refurbishing of an old room back at the old
house. i understand his qualms toward his stepfather: he, vito, is a
seasoned cutting edge against the monotonous espresso-quaffing,
forked-tongued douche like him, the son.

when vito and lani called it quits, there i was, skimming already my
tomes for reference materials that deal with these kinds of things. i
wanted to call the guy who knows this guy who knows this guy and ask for
advice. abashed for myself to be caught amid the whirlwind of these
on&off sweethearts, i tirade with others who nod that not only is this
dipsomaniac affair partly non-convalescent, it is also partly false.

and so: spare me the visual effects and digitized vinyl scratches
press-released for many a black shiny box, because i for one don't
promote feigned nostalgia. had i the chance, i'd let them throat the
minuscule head of pride and claim the experience as either real or
righteously sanctimonious, depending on their combined mood, for their
prized profession.

it always begins with coming to form in front of a bookstore, when all
else simply passes by with me slightly off the center of it. and so,
formally speaking, i found myself in a bookstore. in my case, even
forcing the brain to beckon from phrenology bytes of blurry memory
yields no results as to what were the exact circumstances that placed me
inside that claustrophobic stall except that, perhaps, it had something
to do with my not having anything better to do at that time. perhaps, it
was one of those open-ended scenarios i got caught up in when the
residual glamour that thankfully *was* college had not faded much yet.

this particular book i got while under the influence of boldfaced
impulsive buying brings to me a squishy kind of queasiness that, at
times, disappoints me, because many things in it can only devise
satisfaction if shared, preferably read, to someone of the same
wavelength as i, which my current predicament nay permits.

what makes it more special, though, aside from the fact that i
practically stole it at a low price in BookSale, is the state of its
leaves: that the very pages i intend to dogear had been pre-dogeared by
its previous owner/s.

now, i do notice geodesic lines anywhere else---on public transit with
strangers as meditative glances, on gatherings with peers as exchanged
ideas, etc. ---and with the heaving of internet, stumbling upon such
rarely is an accident one must celebrate. but never have i thought it
possible to find one as a manifestation of an old book's past holder.

the genome immanent in all things wild that had been used are heavy with
geranium's scent, or are they?

they invite themselves in any occasion, regardless of your thought
process. tears do gather after yawning. is, then, sadness really a
consequence of boredom, of that immovable bulge which hinders you from
fixing your stuff? the small area in each of your eyes can only hold so
much liquid before a single drop escapes to your cheeks and rolls onto
the floor. this prismatic essence of your lamentation through which the
worldly light, both void and all, hits the floor with a silvery chime, a
sound with a faint hint of hope in it. however solid the floor, the drop
causes a ripple of about three feet in diameter.

while, affirmative, it is difficult to assure the skeptical self of the
certainty of physics, which supposedly could explain how the universal
vectors work, your understanding of it at the moment is wavy at best.

from the rippling floor an angel figurine gradually emerges.

a lot of things in the world to merit a ponderous hour of wailing, and
yet here the seat shifts for the discomfort of your buttocks already
hardened and sore from days of endless bumming out.

of the many installments of dark moods brooding about, this point, you
wonder, has been chosen by fate to show you how in the mysterious
alchemy of things something so pleasant a stimulus can bloom from where
it is least expected. and law-abiding nature, since it *is* her right to
abandon human expectations from time to time, sends one of her angels to
materialize from none the less the floor over which you were calling out
the wrong concepts of everything.

you visit different quora in search of answers. *is it possible?* how
strange is it, that from the seemingly nullified floor a figurine rises?
can a quick search on google provide a list of such impossible instances
in recorded history?

dissonance malfunctions, and you remember the twitching of twigs and
branches, some 200 of them, phosphorously calcified, classified even
according to use. this is you: how you fumble, how you slink. ever so
determined to stumble on surprises. the casual oh-yes at the face of
pointlessness, the remarkable apathy that none can emulate. i do wonder
of your noir, its artistic levers you manipulate; and, of course, your
hearing---if your hearing past this point still is doing fine---of the
summons of *l\'esprit de l\'escalier*.

in shiny surfaces there are unseen gauntlets on which i thoroughly gauge
my compassion for myself. not that shiny surfaces bear any semblance of
authority on these topics. and, to me, they are either excuses or forms
of torture of the vain to check themselves out before venturing forth
into autumn.

what if instead of trembling lips and a stomach aching for
fullness, i had the most bizarre case of leadened appendages that longed
to labor on heavy tasks? what do i do then if i administer upon the self---beyond
congeniality, that is---a meaning to which that many folks
find so mundane?

i do not fancy myself as a tough guy. ha, i can't even
get pass through ten push-ups without condemning both heaven and earth
for burdening me the thought that i have the strength to accomplish it.
by the principle of mediocrity, from cortex to callous, i am the
outdated modification of man living off on silicons and diodes.

what does this mean? it means that although i am informed, dressed decently
for my everyday bumming, i pother the shenanigans of electronic
equipment for my 'latest fix'. is this then the beginning of a cynical
life? a young man cruised along the devils of modern soc because he
could not give way for what they were imposing on him.

a psychologist could not openly speak out his mind regarding my
disposition as compared to the statistically normal. maybe he is scared
of the consequences he might have to deal with in case he realized that
even he cannot provide a rudimentary analysis of my person, with all the
genius he so often boasts simply he cannot. i am not scared of such
consequences. at one point in our life we meet someone who has the
iron-meshed guts to tell us to our face what we really are. a tim lee
pointed it out: aside from the polishing of my ruffian accent, the
primary reason why i cannot be so out there hard enough is because of my
insufferable detachment from...

in the end, there is no other way but to discern thusly: i don't know
really the concept of people. my condition is irreparable, a chain of
trivial junks shaking more violent the harder i try to fend them off.
unless i consult a shrink.

the infinity offers candid answers to the everyday stigma of having to
live through both heat and heated haughtiness alike, to be the extension
of inventorial productivity.

it will come to a certain passing, this
infinite trade of grit across a cosmic proper, but whether we would
perceive even the faintest of its gleam i am not sure. and i wonder what
must it be like to be seated in front of people whose calling you do not know.
but it is not the kind of wonder that lets one detest one's own
inability to understand. it is the kind that is as trivial as air. and
through this cyclic conversion of unknown into known back into unknown
(like breathing, *o* very much like it) your only companion has been
your faith, untarnished i believe, in the goddess of love.

perhaps, it has something to do with venusian wont,
her majesty's ensemble that
plays the song of all in the language of all.

however, out of all the characters that make up the system,
here we landed unjustly on the cusp of touch.
here we sat across each other: i, desperately losing focus on
the interstellar region of your face;
you, seemingly losing orbit.

and here, our attempts to be as pro as possible stemmed from a sheet of
paper on which writ, to me, the ways i fumbled effortlessly, and, to
you, the overall substance that might be me.

when the prescription of scripts does not match your integrity, as
against that of maestro lording over you, read your orchestration here,
even if it beats rancorously to the chest-pulp.

read your notes, if that kicks you fine,
however scholastic they seem to appear, or unparalleled
to its own nature of being versatile, even if you must say, they kind of
need of undertoning.

being fooled is not a sin, at least not yet;
fooling is.
and you will come to this conclusion when you decide in the
future to come back here and see the molds that have become of your
thoughts.

your notes reflect upon a deeper sentience living off on
others' jokes, and are often the disambiguation of diverse personal
schema: when gloom tinkers you from the inside; when, alas, the strong
and the weak make peace with one another; when you start re-calibrating
your actions to reduce any space for certainty.

read them as you go along.
when no one else is watching.
read them when you are ready to let them gnaw;
and then share them, so they could start gnawing you. your
consciousness perfumes the earthly winds.

two persons from different walks to meet half-way their life spring to
their limbs and trek the jagged streets of city. to embark on a
half-empty ballad, bold though it may seem, only to find out that
fortune-seeking at this impure hour of night offers no permanent
satisfaction; only the minimum requirements to be locked up.

the first person is unmanned, the other unnamed.

the first person strides into the
silent gala with a business-success look, disappointed because the place
is run by rodents, if not by ghosts.
in fact, no one is here, except for
the old person tending the floor with broomstick, and the bartender. not
too long after that the double doors banged as the second runs in after,
rather looking too famished to deny the drag of an unquenchable thirst.

of course, two persons of aerodynamic snobbishness: the first examining
this unnamed fellow, while the second double-taking the bartender, the
contemptuous sort that hands out glares accounting only a part of self
which cares not for the one who would hand the liquor over in such a
tenderly appreciative fashion.

the bartender fumes, fumbles through a
mental handbook (on how to deal with prospective binge-drinkers) for
something to give back to this particularly ill-eyed visitor; and
two-double-aught-three milliseconds later, bartender decides to flash
the bird. the first person assumes understandably the meaning of all the
fuss---the exchange of rudeness and lesser absurdities, the call to
arms of these strangers---and so the first person stands aside and let
the bartender's aim be truer.

a calm strikes in before the heat of duel.
momentous, yet quiet. the unnamed person is hit by the insulting
gesture, but who really fanned the flame?

the first person imagines
stepping in to prevent the spark of bar brawl. unmanned one wants to
participate by stopping it before it goes out of control.

however, here
begins the real awful line of interrogation: who among the first and
second person is real? is it possible that only one of them is real, and
that the other, being unmanned, simply is a chance to change oneself for
one's amusement, a chance to conjure two illusory statements of
different technicalities superimposed as a single image?

hurry---the bartender is fast approaching the breaking point.

after rummaging through an empty vault, and sad, discontent sighing, the
vampire flicks through *Tinder* instead, possibly postulating who goes
right and who goes left. the vampire occasionally looms about a temporal
air that could have escaped into fangs if indeed such superficial fluid
was cinnabar. but air is thinner than blood. this is both the magic*k*
and the trick: that blood trumps oxygen. it chokes the victim yet
cherishes the villain. it triumphs over post-coital interaction, even.
nearly forgotten, although, is the feeling.

much has changed, thinks the vampire. indeed, since the dawn of quantum
physics, humans have actively hunted 'violent' immortals. some crude
group of scientists discovered a way to store huge amounts of natural
sunlight inside a slim electronic device for later dispersion.

finding romance on information age requires plutonium will. to tap the
inner meredithian volition. to violate comfort for survival's sake. to
iron that synthetic duress with the heat that has not been there ever
since. mush has changed; the way the heart tickles its meat with redness
and swelling. the pain. plus fear that would not subside. and this
endless search for a substitute.

exaggerated stories of the 'virtually undying' have evolved. life moves
relatively slow, so people make it a point to disappoint people with
their natural tendencies to create a destroyer within themselves. in the
process, lives are devalued and commercialized. what is the real
purpose, then, of the villainy they see in vampires? the trick is
knowing how small people are compared to the grand scheme. maybe in
knowing, they would evolve accordingly.

...it is a hard task though, this swiping. the capacitive touchscreen of
a smartphone finds it difficult to detect the marble-like fingers of the
vampire. nobody expected this; it was not in the folk lore. with
patience, however, and hours, days, years of attempting, the vampire
would find a way to make this existence a tad more bearable.

when exhibiting to the public's eye the thought processes thrashed
within when procreating for oneself a methodically engineered outfit --
ahem, more accurately known to me as comfortable, ahem -- it seems that
every ogling eyes consequently burn white. knowing already the aged
rings of psychological demure of one from slums, thusly preparing me for
its elitist, english-spanking version, this i can already take. dare i
say that all my adolescent years i have prepared myself to resist this
kind of bombardment. however, some manage to find their way in, those
that are sharp enough.

this curious nagging, this indirect accusations that flesh out the
subject from the subject's skin without physical contact is, to me,
worse than an insulting slap for being in articles that i deemed decent.
this leaving only the fibers -- and where now is the whole plant, the
flower itself, the chance at fruition? uh, what does it accomplish? the
power of scrutiny, as it swirls, is delectable for those who enjoy it.
and why do they enjoy it? i can't know for sure, but i have some
thoughts about it. 

i thought i was way past this nervous point in life (where co-operatives
would want to actually dine with me when i finally mustered that thing
to toughen up and invite them to fool me in their fanciest talks) after
i stepped down from stage to unemployment. and at a certain angle, this
demotion did step up my preconceived ideas about how the gears of
society really work. i now understand more how hoary the rudders are
from underneath the surface. i thought i had the statistics correct. but
now, bit-by-bit redemption thanks to wolfram alpha, maybe i do have what
it takes to be somebody. maybe such provoking an idea scours still the
floor for bits of approval as time is yet to be convinced.

i also thought that apart from the abating personal cynicism, much of
myself has changed: i am constantly fact-checking my nightmares; the
moths and mayflies of wallet have been constantly in touch with me
(although i believe that in a few weeks i would be eating better food);
i have been leaving the doors open around midnight to let the cool
summer air in; et cetera.

does it matter anymore whether i address them of my flaws in lieu of
theirs? -- because i for one am contra their unjust tribulations toward
my laundry list when only a small fraction of it is authentic, the rest
mere spawns of 2nd hand gestures. these odd sort of people usually sets
the standard. one can smell them from lounging too long around the
plucking of pubic hair. the key to ciphering the names and notions
depends on the distance one puts between them and oneself.

another fumbling through life's expectations with damn hot wires and
analytics. they say, "stop in the name of love!" before actually
breaking into a chase. sun never gets them, does not warm them. they
refuse to be warmed. they refuse the warm feeling of basic human
kindness with some sleight of fist; and what does that tell me about
their fundamentals? do i have to read thick hardbounds about people
getting off on hurting others? -- because that is plain sickening. the
cool circulation of oxygenated veins keeps them from messing up. but
they are messed up, whatever it is they doing that is brute-some; and
then some.

that part just before midnight when one complains that one is not
getting enough sleep because of things that requires one's full
attention; and yet, here, inside this blue-less blue void of endless
scrolling and unrequited text posts, one finds oneself murmuring, again,
to an ancient, decrepit self, the crosses to be shouldered, the wounds
to be tended, the feet that wouldn't stand on themselves, the eyes
emulating shutter sounds---because when one works hard, the larks
perched atop a gas station bow down.

one remembers one's office, the
corporate entanglement, the unnecessary po's & opo's; finds oneself
somebody to exhume back from the growling pits of empty stomach, angry,

let the absence of food be the presence of force; or, the will to chop on whilst
towering edifices resist the fall-down. i will gladly look forward to

doing unnecessary math to navigate the undecorated time.

overly hydrating around mates in a structured path because not much has been
assigned to me, save for a few clerical errands.

sometimes, i demand perfect efficiency
(or is it effectivity? effectiveness?) from myself
with every delegated task. sometimes, i refill my container with cold
water. again, to drink what is only free. again, to route the fluids to
a chosen urinal. again, prior to routing weights to be jammed into a
slit between tables. pissing the hours away as i try to improve myself
all the while forgetting the primary functions of wheelies.

i compose as i decompose.

i give the face of time intermittent glances. either i have
overused its purpose or i have succeeded at depleting my calories
finding excessive ones with which to accomplish such obtuseness.

the evidence are in the cameras. they reel inside plastic domes that observe
us from a ceiling fixture, although i believe that behind the actual
screen on which the visuals are relayed, no one monitors us there. which
make us free in this cage. and true enough, there have been rumors about
missing pens, staplers, even items as detectable as dignity. i am at a

underneath the rain he smacked a woman who seemed to be his wife in
front of the by-standers at nearby kiosks. woman shrieked while
retreating. everything was in effect, in sums of violences, from gashing
particulates to blobs that fossilized on damaged area. we grow not
because it is the best way to utilize our duration, but we grow to meet
an endowment with a brutal contraption. i am not afraid of the absence

emotional clouds hung quite low about.

manila is a more decrepit version
of new york or tokyo admixed with brownian cunning; and, i thought, "the
sooner i hike a bus or boat or plane out of here, the better preserved
will the rest of me be." and now that work literally kicks me to fly to
places i have never been, i realize that a huge part of me resists
leaving. that this has been me all along: unswept corridors of ammonia,
loud horns, crying stuck-ups with their placards of hope. this has been

**pro tip:** all allegedly discussed souvenirs for your
predestination-paradox self lies somewhere in the knot of tenses,
somewhere in the itch of it all that this attempts to unveil. all sorts
of discomfort and irony around you, people tend to personify into
existence. you ask, "are you cutesy?" when people evolve to cynics at
rapid rate. you ask, "are you famished?" when same people provide less
space for lonely those. greylings cascade down with every beat at every
turn of every twisted whim. you ask when the future succeeds to fail
you, and i am then bound to answer my mistakes. i tell you to never
attach any sentiments with lifelong web-spinning harmony. later on in
life, some crisis will personify itself into existence, and it will drag
along your tune. you would have to orchestrate an exit from this, lest
you implode. think of *a clockwork orange*. also, never try it with
scents. you ask, "and the 'viddy'?" especially not with visuals.
consider me in your scope: my fields were ideal, but i have aimed lower
since i saw myself when i was 42 and nothing turned out quite well.
really, i have aimed lower, like wall fan low. also, never attach any
memento to taste, as romantic as it may sound, as falsifiable as it
seems. in fact, suppress most of your senses as something happens on the
get-go, and learn to grow wooden roots. be a plant, instead. be balete
and give your ghosts a shade.

"boss," i said, through octopus-chasing-fish arms and some wobbly

matter, as long as from day one to day *n* it is fully paid.

the world out there already is slick with acrylic, carbon, and methanol;
the world, both capable and incapable, patiently arrests every day from
hectic Being. all of it to be maneuvered across vast canvas as a
pixel of immemorial doom.

"boss," i wrote, "i would have handed you the
list of things to buy, which included, but are not limited to,
*a *hubble space telescope, happyness, and un-folding bike; however, the
biped specimen you keep in front of your office to overlord us lesser
specimens---the one with a handsome face yet disproportionate vino belly---told
me that you would have none of it. and so, here i go directly to
you, hoping for you to consider my position."

but before investing on
that muscovado Mut, i had already resigned to my cubicle and flicked
through my head for some used tease ballads for a low-cost
meditation. "if you were paying attention," the remarkable voice said
(i, honored that it acknowledged me after *n* days, listened), "then you
know that at least this day has been a good effort on your end."

anything across lips is merely a stretch mark. any mumbled space-junkie
intuition hurled from the hangar of neurons barely passes as a midget of
thought, if at all. slave of cerveza beyond doubt, iconic among my
peers, because after fifteen months of fruitless search for something to
aim with, what better way to rise from the rashes than to spelunk into a
spunk of malt, etc?

but who am i really? another hole in Sagan's
stardust to stitch? i am as blue as my Corona journal, although not as
busy. i have kept track on finite lists to set at the bottom, a safety
bet against plan-b mishaps.

however, on a blink of choice, the

what better way to outdo the existing mode within an urban area
populated by high-rise buildings and seldom trees than to coalesce with
plot twists of matrix, to dot the spacetime with occupational errors?

what better way to draw lines among cotton clouds than to let them be
drawn towards you? the point of having matters at hand is generally
uplifting. but when the hand turns the knob and the door swings open and
your eyes quickly fix on a stranger sleeping in your space, something
happens in the matrix. something flips the protective device. you take a
look around and start to scrunge sharp items at this lecherous creature.

when i ordered a double-shot espresso, Ms. Barista wondered. perhaps,
to her, my ragged outfit could not justify neither my presence in such a
coffee shop nor my, *mm*, impeccable taste.

i don't blame her; kids these
days are so fond of cold and creamy and sweet drinks. it did not help
that i told her my name is [REDACTED].

my co-worker who was with me at the
time was laughing all the while i flicked through alibis worth
mentioning. so, we had our coffee. after downing mine in an instant,
feeling bitin, i went back to her and ordered their today's-special lung
ching dragonwell tea. not bad.

...

the many repositories of dreams rising in the wet air lacked color. they
had been washed with hours of raining. the depot visit and the pier
inspection were exhausting, but not as much as the traffic jams that
seemed to lock vehicles in their place. what is happening to you,
manila?

i will never have kids, and all of you have been the closest to my
having one. i wish there were a dog memory bank, and from it i could tap

the east of a passing earth, before ranting of pre-babylon slams, was

of multiple layers of skin. flecks of time on my nape brushed, and an
ever-perennial manna knocked twice, thrice on a clogged nose. some say
it is the season of sickness, some say a culture of post-resurrection
destruction. so i sleep with my skullcap on even nothing abed is wrong

all the minor spinning gestures of hand spun around a cold air complex
like pinwheel moved by breath; and by the window, the rush of wheels
hummed whenever the circle lit green. sometimes, out of curiosity, one
peeks out of the glass into the faraway holes of edifices, wondering who
or what could have been transpiring behind those idle curtains. but the
greyness of mist alters the visible with how motes of toxin continue
their hype of damascened invasion. maybe it was not the outside world
that i should speak about, but who was near me at the time: a bundle of
flesh held by nuisance, a keen sense of wont for
strangers-turning-friends. maybe this should not be a travelogue of one

As casual clothing settled the scene, as fraud conjurations of
how-art-thou's carouseled from person to person, there hung somewhere an
imagined tension when lamps closed their eyes and snuffed the din from
air. Confusion greeted people as though an accomplice passing by to
remind of the indelible horrors they had spray-painted together one
night. But it was thought to be day. Not entirely was the din muted,
however. In fact, the instant after the dark bit, everyone was close to
hysterical. When the lights flickered again, and the piercing tone that
followed had gone to another place, people realized that it was not a
trick. The surprise groped them by the chest; and soon, heart, sinew,
and splendid callings contested the visions of our kindred spirits that
did not know when and where to place said items.

if a person is ultimately limited by myopic projections of self into the
future deemed a greener pasture, then that person, in one way or
another, somehow has predestined themself to do anything just so such
projections would materialize, although the term 'anything' encompasses
a general lot.

it is not a blanket testament with which to contrast past
with present with future self. it merely is (well, to me) the most
brutal a person can get.

'anything could happen and the world resembles the genitals of an oyster'
is talking high likeliness of success here.
i myself could not believe it at first, that these people exist, until
i've met them in person. alcohol tricks them into voicing their
aspirations. i've heard of guns, i've heard of meticulous premeditation,
left, right jaunts to querida's night post, and so on; and through all
these monologues, i have no choice but to keep it to myself, smile,
maybe aggressively nod my shrunken head. at some point, they could bend
some without breaking some... there has to be a counterculture for this
one that tolerates person-to-person infection of ideals as one tries to
climb the proverbial ladder, this pulp-thought reduction process amidst
weaving into royal grandeur of scum.

or, perhaps, it is inevitable: that
one must kick and pull wrungs down in order to get up. it is here, me
looking out only for myself, as the community attempts to quantify
accomplishments.

1. coming across people who dislike looking into details---their criteria
amuse me. when a metronome ticks before them, no more measurement is
made. sleep shatters upon heads like candy bottles.
1. modern times reminds them that not once did svelt carbon fiber quiver
beneath them. it is the weakness: apparatuses inundating joints with
last influx of work before altogether creaking to halt.
1. when a rooster cocks a pellet into a toy pistol, his pagan god will soon
peer from the velvetine outlines of clouds. it will be another day of
hustling, of pointing out squares out of people's eyes. he will say,
"your eyes look different" without even looking at them. he is, after
all, a pathological liar. the rooster pecks for worms or insects, and
could only long for better junk, but that is as far as longing goes.
1. joking bones: each booms of infantile caresses. cooing for attention,
sometimes, even shopping for physicians. it is understandable that not
many can tolerate pain, as pain comes in various forms in varying
degrees. most probably, amongst documents filed away, a check-up receipt
stating the ignoramus faults sits between page 5 and page 38 of a
journal.
1. no considerations for personal space whatsoever. these people are
supposed to be adults?
1. ah, used to be a front man. his failings have grown their own mustache,
more greige than heartbreak convention located downtown. oh, my heart,
he says. oh, my fellows, i am sad, terribly sad, he says. he gets no
reply from mentioned fellows.
1. u mean a thundering audacity, a non-meditative response to any
inquiries? u mean the puffballs they call clenched fists? u mean the
frisks that are actual forms of abuse and not just accidents and/or
innuendos?
1. restless, red-eyed lizards.
1. (shoutout to all real lizards of the world: i am not speaking ill of
you, nor am i comparing your actions to some wicked ways... if, somehow,
my wording did imply that, i'm sorry.)
1. the look that never outlasts its detractors. the half-truths that are
sent forth as breeding grounds for new predicaments. the baritone, the
technicolor teeth which do not fool anyone.
1. lustful initiative. cris de coeur include heavily tainted hashtags.
melding incomplete, because they could easily be spotted even when no
one is looking.
1. 'hunger' doth not mean the stomach speaketh naught. it is entirely
something else.
1. has an inexplicable disgust for any shade of red, but once admitted was
a commie. this must be a prank.

any boyish systems, although 99% of which are righteous and do not need

Through high-pitched sirens hurting at the corner to be struck i nudged
my frame, peeping past the blurring fluorescent beams that are never
rare in such an 'inviting' intersection of minds. As i did, i looked
into my kissing kit for a breath analyzer, only to realize that the mood
for exchanging saliva with a prospective lovapalooza participant never
knocked on me, and thus, no such machine could ever be acquired from any
of my baggage. If distance were personified or science had it in simpler
definition, then it was both a bedmate and an opponent.

Wait: Mind? But---Many possess intimidating ones with nice compartments

The curve suggesting the rate of dissociation lies proximal to both

possibility of grime. To think again, to sink again. To feel that the
ullage, however contemptible its volume, presses hard against the end of
spine upwards. I might come up with a prayer of my own contra
drag-downs. I might be the perpetual antagonist in my internal
monologue, and not once could have I flinched even in knowing; that in

You are pulled from your attachment to the vertical beam. The landscape

dreams whose spirits swimming gradually farther to depths; and between
pulses you expounded on rests that could have been filled by escaping

any misadventures of life plutonian boiling beyond this intimate space
could not have been perceived through the dormer. when i knocked, the
self inside pried open the crying room's door with stubby digits and,
then, welcomed the convection of scents: here the stench, and there the
rosette.

i looked at self, and there in its hollows i felt the cheeky,
smothered ditty of hold. while it's not the catchiest, it sure was a
wicked tune in itself, and in my free time i would love to clown around
its structure and rhymes. however, no more measuring tactics, no more
amour left for strangers' consumption, only wisps to be transferred
through wordplay.

then, in such opaque illumination, this self denounced
its frustration: i was actually laughing there to things like maslow's
*B*ig thinkpiece, because never in my time that i felt it was accurate

time the sand would grain the lids, it took me some millions of

the thin metal sheet, a reflective yet a liminal piece, attempts to
uncover mysteries that are only open to the beholder. sometimes, objects
do have malice enchantments in them, and the eyes unlock them out of
habit. should this be the case? when viewing from another surface this
same viewer, he glows with the foe, he prays with the perilous bunch
that is his kin. he does not cuss unattractive pitches, but, as and if
he exhales, he exhales a poison cloud that had long dwelled inside. he
frees raven, and thus he is freed, if only temporary. it is a wonderful

i am once again haunted by a renewed beating-bad, breaking the shape of
its old vessel, as if china when subjected to rapid thermal fluctuations---ice
then ire then cold then coal---to form a different stasis to
contain the essence.

absence would be an ace state if it weren't for the choice to commit
(to) a sabado mistake. on it victorian-era sleuth-style: i dive into a
helpless case. humans reach for the stars, gamma with or without.

unceremoniously here again with the annual plight of fighting what to
others must not be fought but rather accepted. here, assimilating both
smog and snot into a wound behind an ear, and dust backfilling the
doggone crevices, as i contemplate on a chair the way the lights play
for grace, if not for a theistic symbol of horseplay.

a white on mic mimics mother tongue poorly so as to invite humor, but
this is simply pale, and frankly, he wanks on scores of eyerolls from
some of the audience who cannot ingest a sound he produces. the others
seem to enjoy his gimmick though.

scars line up to park here: this plane uncharted that brings to vision
sightly dresses pacing the velveteen. of course, the velvet itself is as
authentic as it can get, unseen only to the elite before but now just
strides away. however, even when we do not connect on any level, even
when the sour growl of long-live stomach progresses to deep
reverberations of tectonic plates, absence does not taper the taste left
by pussyfoot in mouth, nor the chills in its cavities. images clipped by
the mental camera are prone to alterations, mind you, probably of and by
the disenfranchised. when i repress the shutter, the whole thing becomes
corrupted.

in the beginning, nothing fabulous soared over the horizons except for a
looming Sluggishness, only at the time, it was sort of a gargantuan dry
plasmid. if it were to be seen, it would have looked gooey, and it being
shapeless was the only shape it was known for. however, none of the
accounts i have read thus far confirmed this. all of which are
"educated" suspicions based on in-depth studies of tragedies that befell
those who dared view it with meager eyes. i shall not speak of such
tragedies for this will not be another sad story to post on the internet
for everyone to spit at---*no*.

in the beginning, there came about tons of books of praise, all written
by, *and* for, some being known as the Hydrogen God. the Hydrogen God,
out of his lack of respect for balance, thought everything seemed too
refined for palatability; thought everything needed a different stir to
shake up and wake up the tired droning buzz. he wanted a brand new high,
basically.

so, the Hydrogen God tore Sluggishness from its place in space, and with
the right kit at hand, rolled it into one galactic spliff. the Hydrogen
God lit up one end and puffed into the other. he blew a stream of smoke
into the nether, and from the cloud, HG created the first Lazy Man.

i was not given a name. maybe the effects of Sluggishness had already
gone to HG's bloodstream, and he was therefore too pinned down to do
anything else, naming his creation included. besides, who needs a name?
don't look at me. i am not one to be labeled by some vagabond deity who
cannot even contain the effects of his undoing. i do not need a name.
not in this place, anyway, nor in this lifetime...

i sat there, too patiently, in that oblivion where my creator summoned
me. nothing fabulous kept me afloat. i thought of impeding any
fluctuation of the joule parameters within my vicinity that might
jumpstart a significant chain of events which could lead to the eventual
formation of an intelligent life form. and you know what, i did just
that. been at it for a long time now. all for a sorry fun.

it is not a matter of how or why, that much i can tell you.

another hobby i recently got myself into: i pen short short stories, for
personal consumption, of course. the Hydrogen God is still too zoned out
to be bothered conjuring cosmic mythos, so i took it upon myself to
imagine infinite number of worlds. you know, to pass infinite time. i

long as i have myself and the vast dark playground before me. and this

for each of the fresh reddish spots i scalpel'd with the blunt of a
forefinger, i chimed a heart-crafted curse to dispel the unwarranted
jovian visits that kept me rolling the sweat onto the sheet sea while
fending off bugs that have tried poking me with their probosces and
mandibles.

Sandman, come in---you who mastermind putting powdered
benadryl retina-deep in your woe-filled devotees ---and sort this mess
out for me. in the morning, i live a radical life of not masking the
previous night's hubris with strong persuasion sitting on my perfume
shelf. i imbibe the provincial smell whence i hail. everywhere reeks of
hyperspace, but not me: i have yet to find my grip on what things still
feel loutish upon the muted function of third leg.

You want the mechanics of peptide, but I only have the schematics of
polyester. The inner anarchist reaches for the doomsday switch, but the
literate hive mind swats the extending arm; wishes instead for every
peyote here to pop the magic. To enlighten. To tread the sliver with all
limbs flapping less, the tides ripping fewer pores at soles, the wind
poeming benign whispers against ears, all of which parts of balancing
act. And the act is protein versus plastic.

But really, I am more of
anarchaic than political antihero awaiting backfire. Meaning, the soul
reacts to familiar stimuli which so despises resolution that some
passersby might mistake them for keyboard propaganda. This is never the
case.

Admittedly, I am no hacked engine in the game of fabrication.
Everybody has spat sulfur pyre on the imp's face without assessing the
probable comebacks of said critter. Because that hits right sometimes.
We have an itch for that. And we have a special occasion for
scratching that itch.

Those who babble otherwise usually have megaphones
locked in their hands, and who trusts people with megaphones?

As for me,
I beckon not good karma as bargaining device for my supposed Good Deed,
but Whatever comes, I always hope that it is filtered.

within two hours of sleep, i dreamed of sneaking through the night
peeping down the flight of stairs to see where the droning sound was
coming from. i saw darth vader speaking to two huge hemispheres of
brain. i realized that the talking brainiacs were manifestations of the
sith douchebag's current dilemma. they were in a debate whether to tell
luke the Whole Story. before adjorning, however, one of them sensed that
someone "from nearby is listening." i dashed back to my bed, dived
beneath sheets, and pretended to sleep, just in time before a spotlight
beamed at me. the deep mechanical sound of heavy breathing wrapped
around my neck; anakin was choking me.

apparently, this was a nightmare.

Here it is: constantly forwarding through spacetime slosh is, at any
point, the first attempt at barbiturate-laced Slurpee.

The need for validation spams my inbox,
and I'm not astute with these kinds of commotion to begin with.
I think about my welfare and how it really
isn't well nor fair. Tossing around thoughts. Trying to laugh at inside
jokes. Only drawings of ghosts I have seen; their existence has yet to
materialize. Something must be out of place. Is it because I'm too far
out there or in too deep? Chasing the wrong sedan?

I don't like it when
people tell me that I shouldn't stop being me, for I am my own
speculation, a reality bent on forgoing its very details to make room
for other semi-substantial objects. I am unique like a damned snowflake
in a winterless country. Trying to laugh at inside jokes. They never
tire me. *Pero puta ang init talaga,* don't tell me otherwise.

So many upbeat tunes crossed with deadening lyrics for taking a walk.
The surge comes from somewhere Elise, comes from two hemispheres that do
not know where to place the excess. The brain signals the body to get up
and actually go do something. The body can respond in so many ways. One
of which is buying a liter of merlot fresh from a fly-infested wallet.
Another is something Elise.

the theses we overcome, the cases we study, the population in which we
thrive, the days when we catch gamma with skin, the people we whisk
away, the vitriol from one speaker to another

-- in order to forward the plot, we improvise with what we have. we pick
but are only chosen sometimes. we give off colors to the untrained eye.
we infer correctness based on others' errata and yet the current state
of our spirits are perpendicular conrete structures, devoid of epoxy.
with digital love we evoke phlegm from underused larynx and promptly
spit it on sepulchre. we buy into the collective retardation, and the
romantic fervor of flesh is the currency. i don't want to believe that
this is it. i have been at it for quite some time now, and i want out.

i have no actual depth when i talk about these things. at the very
least, my attempts inaccurately convey comprehensive thought process
that could forward the plot. and yet what do we have here is a musing.

a child of the Ocean comprises 95% of unexplored secrets, the darkest of
which obliterates. an evolved creature addressing the surface as skin,
already reached maturation billions of summers ago, but acts childish
nonetheless. the waves roll in quick and recede back. they stretch out
and feel the eyes following their curves. a small change on skin
prepares the person for the ubiquitous lure of littoral babes, but since
people riding the same surf dislike follow-through shuffles, the person
simply allows tender shit to overwhelm until fatigue. at night, the
person exclaims, "none of my people are hitting on me."

Date: Thu, 04 Aug 2016

1. Dismay that stretches for lightyears affects the chances of Amity,
but since i have the basic knowledge of the universal forces at work, we
can stop at the nearest orbit.
2. I nurse my delusion here, the core of which is a common denominator
amongst my genus. To quench dry throats with muddied corpse. To still
the famished guts with potential firm oodle. A one-way street to the
hills with no intention of going down. Oh, wait, that is the intention!
To lay bare my light schemes. To strike the opening of the dam.
3. Strange dialogues lead to a certain blend of fun:
kind-slash-sardonic, and involves a lot of knives. Murderous *pero medyo bastos*, if that's a thing.
4. Volatile gas transforms a meadow into possibly a burning field of
poaceae in a sundress. Butane bites make sharp shells go boon.

For example, I pull you towards me and you sigh.

Sleepless junkies (only two of them) meet up in the metro's heart, and
out of taste for magic, things escalate within a filip's sound. But the
first person, a male, is not actually sleepless. In fact, he cannot
function without a proper rest, like most cats his age. He is not a cat
person, though. He sleeps better when with the canine friend around than
the dog who accompanies him whilst asleep.

So, let me repeat:

A sleepless junkie and a dog person meet up in the metro's heart, and
because the two can only spar with each other using pixie dust during
play time, matters get out of hand quickly. That's a good thing, in
retrospect. In this life where strange people collide, patience is a
platinum commodity. The second, the junkie, is a personified vat of
pheromones. It is understandable then to have sentient beings vying for
her attention as she whisk each one away with a bird-flip. She goes home
with the dog person one night to be able to witness the sunrise together
the following morning.

Both of them spends a good deal of locomotive exercise all this time.

dissociative disorder---i think a large fraction of my existence
comprises this, sans the professional papers to officiate the prognosis.

the delay of senses, the obscure metathesis that comes from looking
beyond perception, the recommendations of experts on the matter on how
to behave like a statistically adequate individual: they all seem to go
hand in hand with each other, but seeing that, upon careful study, each
is immiscible with the other two, i am left confused, internally
scratching the internal of my head. i want to believe that this isn't
the case, but most of the time, as i may have told multiple people many
a time already, i easily feel out of place. it's as if i were really out
of my body, in a nearby space afloat, watching this self go about his
routine, mindless and/or mechanical.

on my best days, i'd like to
believe i am a functional solpsist, if that's a thing.

from time to time, there needs to be some sort of reminder from this self to let the
whole of me know that everything---literally the whole universe, as per
scientific suggestions---leads to heat death. it's not exactly
aphrodisiac that in telling this whole notion of maximum entropy, one
would make one's partner undress quicker than a collapsing star.

however, with the right person at the right time using a mouth and words
and spit that are maced with peppermint-ish bliss, it could put things
into perspective.

maybe i can do this quarterly, this twisted reminder,
a periodic self-love full of methods to vanquish the selected segments
of reality i particularly dislike at the time, until i recover from
whatever blurred wound it is that i'm recovering from. i don't even know
if science can back me up on this. i'm not even sure if i want science
to back me up on this, because it might entail a whole lot of
paperworks.
and my life right now is just date after date of corporate
diligence which i'd like to screw up because they are becoming toxic. i
just want the damn thing to beam me up, and let me leave already, for
realz.
