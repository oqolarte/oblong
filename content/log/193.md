It's both heartbraking and incensing to hear the motives of
contemporaries from Global North who outsource (or "delegate") their
unwanted tasks to workers in Global South on the cheap.

[Capitalism](/capitalism) incentivizes these
entrepreneurs to seek profit, and encourages them to think that their
time is worth more than those of us here. This line of thinking helps
perpetuate Empire's machine, *all* while having their best lives and not
losing sleep over any of it, because, they say, it's a "win-win for
everyone."

More shocking to me is that this comes from a person-of-color. I guess,
capitalist-wannabes need to be diverse, too!
