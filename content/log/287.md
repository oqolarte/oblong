We end the month of July 2025 with the sun shining down upon us after
weeks of typhoons and floods. I see not just people outside, but
fandom/s---recently, of [EXO's Kai](https://www.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/showbiz/events/2025/7/30/-kaion-in-manila-exo-s-kai-is-fierce-flirty-in-electrifying-concert-1143).

## Curating the algo

Even when I used to have a consistent presence in major
[social media](/social-media) platforms, I did not encounter anyone saying they
are "curating their algorithm." At one point, the feed stopped being in
chronological order and became algorithmic---a flurry of posts that "you
might like" based on your tastes, your friends, your line of work. But I
do not recall anyone being proud of their active curation. So coming
across the phrase just recently amazed me. Really, I found it bleak.

On one hand, "curating my algorithm" implies long hours of screen time
and doomscrolling. It is akin to building the perfect home entertainment
setup---you only do it because you foresee spending a non-trivial time using it.

On the other hand, it is a strategy in which the user interacts only
with what they want to see at any given time. While the phrase shocked
me, it is not my place to judge people who do this. I am more
disappointed in the institutions, corporate entities, and nation states
that have allowed broligarchies to be the main conduits of information.
Curating one's algo, I think, is just one of the many ways we cope as we
are forced into big tech platforms.

Curating one's algorithm is so unlike curating a long list of RSS feeds
(mine is currently in the ~200s at the time of writing) RSS feeds are
more organic and federated. But having one's own RSS feed implies that
one is open to the idea that the internet is *still* bigger than the
social media platforms, that there are sites out there that one can
still subscribe to via RSS.

We live in weird times where our mental health could be tethered to our
online persona. If, however, you would rather touch grass, then it is
not practical to overcommit to curating one's algo or list of RSS feeds.

But then again, going outside feels like a scam these days, and I do not
mean that to sound antisocial. Look, there are barely any third spaces
for the wandering public crowd to just chill and hang out for free. The
actual streets are where we could [*tambay*](/tambay), but obviously, it
is full of SUVs with mad drivers in them. Touching grass might not even
be possible depending on where you live. Extreme weather changes just
make it a little less safe out there.
