AI refers to computer programs that can craft systems to perform tasks
requiring human-like intellect, like discovery, inference, and
reasoning. A subset of AI is [Machine Learning](/ml) (ML).

Key Domains of AI:

- Natural Language Processing: Understanding and generating human language.
- Computer Vision: Making sense of visual data.
- Text to Speech: Converting written text into spoken words.
- Motion/Robotics: Making machines move or perform tasks.
- Generative AI: Systems that can create content.
- *many more*

**More clarification**: LLM is Large Language Model (LLM), the most well-known
gateway to which is ChatGPT; AGI is Artificial General Intelligence, the
notion of a computer that can think like people can.

It's something that computer scientists and [engineers](/engineering)
are developing to supposedly automate boring tasks so we can focus on
making art, but doing quite the opposite.

LLMs are *language* models (it even says so in the name) and have not
been specifically been trained to solve mathematical problems.

## Generative AI

One specific type of AI, and perhaps the most popular, is generative AI
(gen AI), which is AI that can generate new content, like text, images,
or other media from a prompt, which is just a set of specific
instructions, that the user supplies.

One might use gen AI for any of the following:
- Create content
- Analyze information quickly
- Summarize information to use in research
- Simplify day-to-day work

## Cons of AI

[Make no mistake---AI is owned by Big Tech](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/12/05/1084393/make-no-mistake-ai-is-owned-by-big-tech/).
A lot of AI-related startups and research labs depend on the
infrastructure that Microsoft, Amazon, and Google provides.

[Can we even achieve full automation without the human touch](/autonomation)?

I don't want that, after having read Victoria Turk's piece on
[how AI reduces the world to stereotypes](https://restofworld.org/2023/ai-image-stereotypes/).
In it, the author quoted Amba Kak, executive director of AI Now
Institute:

> Essentially what this is doing is flattening descriptions of, say, ‘an
> Indian person’ or ‘a Nigerian house’ into particular stereotypes [old
> man with a beard, and a run-down house, respectively] which
> could be viewed in a negative light.

AI worsens misinformation and low-quality content because it lacks the
ethical nuance with which to include in the contents it produces.

In [an interview by *The Guardian*](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jun/06/microsofts-kate-crawford-ai-is-neither-artificial-nor-intelligent), Kate Crawford said on what people should know about how AI products are made (emphasis mine):

> We aren’t used to thinking about these systems in terms of the
> environmental costs. But saying, “Hey, Alexa, order me some toilet
> rolls,” invokes into being this chain of extraction, which goes all
> around the planet… We’ve got a long way to go before this is green
> technology. Also, systems might seem automated but when we pull away
> the curtain we see large amounts of low paid labour, everything from
> crowd work categorising data to the [never-ending toil](/anti-work) of
> shuffling Amazon boxes. **AI is neither artificial nor intelligent. It
> is made from natural resources and it is people who are performing the
> tasks to make the systems appear autonomous.**

## What to think of LLM

Large language models (LLMs) are not meant to be used as search engines.
LLMs are, in simpler terms, based on [statistics](/statistics) in that
they only predict a likely answer. To understand it better, when you
type a question or prompt, you're actually asking the LLM to give back
the most likely response of people to that sort of query/prompt. Don't
expect it give a "right answer."
