## Intro

The academia is all about respectability.

It shouldn't be the limiting factor, though,
for one to contribute to the sum of human knowledge.

Accountability practices are also limited in academia. In many cases,
academic institutions have done nothing in scandals but to protect their
name.

## Questioning the role of academia

I wonder if it's better to be a scholar outside of traditional, more
structured academia, getting only backing from [community](/community)
like friends and family with whom I have personal stakes in.

Has science cornered the market on truth? It is a worthwhile question to
explore, especially no that [we use hard data](/data-management) to
[both control others and bend truth](/fascism). While waiting for the
smarter and wiser people than me to write their takes, I think we could
all agree that science and tradtional knowledge may converge on the same
truth if each would "listen to" or center the subject of study---plants,
animals, even people.

Certainly, there are hidden nuggets of wisdom and maybe science in the
daily life, not just within university walls, when one is willing to
tinker, to ask the questions, to look stupid once in a while, all in
pursuit of learning more about the world we live in and sharing your
findings with the public.

David Edgerton and Terence Kealey both question the link (if any)
between academic science and economic prosperity. Are we to believe that
universities are repositories of knowledge? Or can we also access
knowledge outside of academia, and contribute even to the betterment of
society?

## Gatekeeping and/or misogyny in academia

It remains unsurprising yet disappointing still how academia (some?
most? all?) is rarely receptive of scientific research that is grounded
on tradition and observations, especially of old women. This misogyny is
subtle, in that it is not often we hear about this outside scholarly
spaces.

## Writing papers, sharing ideas?

Paywalls hinder people from gaining information.
Consider the 2014 Ebola outbreak and how the
disease had been mapped out since the 1980s, but that info hadnâ€™t been
disseminated to west African scientists and doctors during the epidemic
because it was only posted among European and American academic
communities, with paywalls as high as USD 40 per article.

Contrary to popular belief, academia---and more broadly, science---is
not pure objectivity and truth. Science is a process embedded in
societal contexts.
