After watching and rewatching videos on how to repair Apple's Magsafe Power Adapter 1
(not sure what the official name is),
I decided to actually try repairing the thing, because I need it to work:
when the MacBook it came with was given to me, it had no battery.
It would boot directly from the power adapter, if only there's a working one around.

Patience is a different skill set, in my opinion.
But I may be setting the bar low here for calling it a skill set.
Isn't it a Virtue?
