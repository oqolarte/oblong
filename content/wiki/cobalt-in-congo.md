*Reflections and thoughts are from my reading Siddhartha Kara's book*
[Cobalt Red](/259/#brief-review-of-cobalt-red). *Each paragraph can be a
standalone idea.*

## Preambles in shambles

I have been thinking exactly about how my face would be "locked in a
terminal expression of dread" if I die violently for some reason outside
my control. It's been happening to people elsewhere: to artisanal miners
in Congo who are either killed or buried alive in collapsing tunnels for
doing what they do to survive.

According to McKinsey's article "[Lithium and cobalt: A tale of two commodities](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/metals-and-mining/our-insights/lithium-and-cobalt-a-tale-of-two-commodities)",
cobalt and lithium markets have been driven by battery demand, for
consumer electronics and now for the booming electric vehicle (EV)
industry, and that demand for both is only expected to increase to supply for the EVs.

In their article from 2019, "[Amnesty challenges industry leaders to clean up their batteries](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/press-release/2019/03/amnesty-challenges-industry-leaders-to-clean-up-their-batteries/)" within "five years."

> [C]ompanies should publicly disclose information about how human
> rights abuses and environmental risks are being prevented, identified
> and addressed throughout the lithium-ion battery’s lifecycle...
> Companies who overlook human rights concerns as they clean up their
> energy sources are presenting their customers with a false choice;
> people or planet. This approach is gravely flawed and will not deliver
> the sustainable changes we need to save humanity from climate
> devastation. We are asking industry leaders to think hard about what
> kind of future they want to build."

As Kara has presented in his book, companies have been claiming, in
essence, they are not violating any human rights abuses in their cobalt
supply chain, but only because the sourcing has been abstracted away so
many times before it has even reached the formal supply chain.

When the more progressive people pronounce "Black Lives Matter," I
believe it to the extent that it includes Black lives everywhere,
including African people, who up to this day are being dehumanized and
enslaved by different global powers for many reasons, chief among is
that the earth beneath the African continent contains generous amounts
of natural resources.

Belgium, United Nations, USA---they conspired to assassinate Congo's
first democratically elected prime minister Patrice Lumumba for offering
an anti-colonialist vision and, more importantly, hope for Congolese
people. In his place, neocolonialists installed a violent dictator
[Joseph Mobutu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobutu_Sese_Seko) as their puppet. The Brussels Times article "[Facing the truths of Belgium’s colonial past: The unresolved case of Patrice Lumumba’s death](https://www.brusselstimes.com/news/magazine/50661/facing-the-truths-of-belgium-s-colonial-past-the-unresolved-case-of-patrice-lumumba-s-death)"
says that "[i]t would take Belgium 40 years to decide to investigate its
post-colonial role in the affair and to admit its moral complicity in
the murder. But still justice has not been served."

## Rich cobalt

MIT Office of Sustainability, in their article "[Cobalt-free batteries could power cars of the future](https://sustainability.mit.edu/article/cobalt-free-batteries-could-power-cars-future)", explains:

> Most electric cars are powered by lithium-ion batteries, a type of
> battery that is recharged when lithium ions flow from a positively
> charged electrode, called a cathode, to a negatively electrode, called
> an anode. In most lithium-ion batteries, the cathode contains cobalt,
> a metal that offers high stability and [energy density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density).

Side note: I believe that not only should we move on from
rechargeable batteries with cobalt cathodes, we should also scrap the
whole EV "revolution" altogether. There are [better ways to go and transport masses around](/transpo). In this linked study, it is revealed
that the research is "funded by Lamborghini," a known manufacturer of
luxury sports cars.

As car manufacturers transition from fossil fuel to rechargeable
batteries to power their vehicles, they do not become "more
sustainable." A battery pack of an EV contains around 10 kg of cobalt.
Increase in demand in cobalt is necessary if these makers would want to
meet the growing consumer demand for the supposed cleaner EVs. Really,
it means more environmental catastrophes! And so we ask, "Is renewable
energy really better for the world?"

As with many [colonial projects](/empire), mineral wealth has been
siphoned out of the colonies back to the empire, not even benefiting
the Katangans or Congolese.

Major industrial copper-cobalt mining complexes in Haut-Katanga and
Lualaba Provinces are secured by armed forces including
[FARDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_the_Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo)
, Congolese National Police, and other militias.

Unfortunately, in Congo, they do not have (yet) sufficient energy
capacity to refine cobalt, which would have put more importance in their
place in the supply chain.

[Technology](/technology) advancement is not always admirable. In many
cases, progress on one end is being offset by the suffering it causes on
the other. Some eye-opening documentaries on this matter, and how
consumerism supercharges it, look into:

- [*Buy Now! The Shopping Conspiracy*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt34350086/) (2024)
- [*The Story of Stuff*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GorqroigqM)
  (YouTube)

After being popular for being a coloring agent, cobalt has been used in
many other things, one of the most notable of which is lithium-ion
rechargeable batteries. The spike in demand for cobalt began around the
rise in popularity of smartphones (2007 for iPhones, 2008 for Android
phones) and tablets. This demand is also found in other consumer
electronics like laptops, and electric transportations like e-scooters,
e-bikes, and EVs.

According to the United Nations, [The Paris Agreement](https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/paris-agreement), so
called after the [UN Climate Change (COP21) in Paris](https://www.cop21paris.org/) last 12 DEC 2015, is a "legally
binding ineternational treaty" set to meet long-term goals of all
nations like:
- limiting global temperature increase below 1.5°C;
- assessing progress towards meeting this goal; and
- financing the Global South to mitigate negative effects of climate
  change.

As of writing, it's been almost a decade now, and the Agreement has only
felt more like a scam. In the context of cobalt, meeting the "ambitions"
would require more EV production. This is a *very* limited view, because
it assumes that  there's no other way to go around except in cars; and
no other alternatives but to meet "market demand."

## How life has been in Congo

Exploitation of Katangan copper proved to be useful around the World War
I, when milliions of b ullets fired by Britisha and American forces came
from the slavery of African copper miners. War, including the supply
chain component of it, has destroyed lives!

During World War II, Katanga was again exploited for its gold, tin,
tungsten, cobalt, and copper. Congolese, after being useful in mines,
were then sent to die in the battlefields.

Neocolonialism takes on different forms and can come from any nation.
Nowadays, China ramps up its cobalt extraction from Congo to meet its
consumer electronics demand, which of course supplies tech companies
from US, UK, and other Global North nations.

*Mbazi*---heterogenite. This is the "beating heart of rechargeable
economy."

Sexual abuse plagues the girls and women of mining communities, another
scourge to suffer on top of the already brutal realities that make the
cobalt supply chain running.

In some (maybe all) depots to which the mined heterogenite are sold, a
small laser handgun locally called "Metorex" is used to determine the
concentration of cobalt per kilogram, which then determines the price of
the ore.

[Metorex](https://www.metorexgroup.com/) turns out to be a
"mining group... positioned in the southern African bsae metals mining
industry as a pure copper and cobalt investment." It is [related to Jinchuan Group](https://www.metorexgroup.com/investors-and-media/shareholder-information/)
as its holding company based in China.

Toxicity is normal in mining communities, with all the heavy metals like
cobalt, copper, zinc, lead, cadmium, germanium, nickel, vanadium,
chromium, and uranium being found inside miner's families, including
children. Sadly, Congo's public healthcare system is not yet equipped to
handle the negative effects of this large-scale poisoning.

Poverty seems inescapable for the people in mining communities. For one,
miners do not receive living wage for the labor the do. The value of
their labor, ironically, is extracted and refined upstream to benefit
only the "legal" side of the supply chain. "No one up the chain considers
themselves responsible for the artisanal miners, even though they all
profit from them," Kara observes. *Everyone* is complicit to the
suffering and poverty of Congo.

Because of institutions like Global Battery Alliance and Responsible
Minerals Initiative that maintain the illusion that "cobalt is clean"
that the situation in mining communities in Congo does not change. If
they are not in Congo to actually see and assess the on-going abuses,
then they have no [skin in the game](/skin-in-the-game) to report otherwise.

## Things that often go untold

Bigotry can come from anyone, so long as there are hierarchies between
people: social status, financial well-being, even just belonging with a
larger group who happens to be the majority of the local population.
Bigots let loose with co-bigots, because they feel safer around
like-minded people. I suspect it's harder to unlearn this in an echo
chamber.

[Shinkolobwe mine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinkolobwe) was a
radium and uranium mine that provided ~75% of high-grade uranium to the
[Manhattan Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project)
that produced the bombs deployed by [Enola Gay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enola_Gay#Crews) on Hiroshima and
Nagasaki, Japan.

In DRC, the uneducated and ignorant often more vulnerable to
exploitation, especially in a broken education system in which the State
does not invest in improving it, perpetuating control.

In 1900, [Edmund Dene Morel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._D._Morel), while working as clerk for Elder Dempster (a
Liverpool shipping line), found out that the "natives of Congo were
being systematically robbed" by studying the [statistics](/statistics)
of the flow of goods in and out of Congo.

[Congo Reform Association](https://www.congoreformassociation.org/)
(CRA) was the first international human rights organization in the 20th
century, driven by data (through Morel's work) and survivor testimonies
(through [the work of Roger Casement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casement_Report), British Consul
to the Congo Free State).

To expose the earth for digging, forests have to be cleared, the wood
from which are burned to be charcoal, used for heating and cooking in
the villages.

Most Congolese government officials deny or diminish the existence of
child labor in [mining](/mining). At least one of them (according to Kara's
interviews) said that they (the children) were
[Pygmies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmy_peoples), implying that
they are actually not children, but rather adults whose average height
is unusually short. AND!---even if they were Pygmies, they still deserve
better and safer working conditions incentivized, if anything, with a
living wage.

## Congo as colony to the whole world

Through intimidation and manipulation---because how else can average
white men conquer the world---[Henry Morton Stanley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Morton_Stanley) was able to
secure hundreds of treaties from Congolese tribes for King Leopold II's
Association Internationale du Congo (AIC).

At least in the 1960s, Lever brothers bought ~75,000 square kilometers
of rain forest filled with palm oil trees "to supply their soap recipe
needing palm oil." They used forced labor under a quota system. The
profits helped prop up Unilever, a company that's mired in multiple
[crimes against humanity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilever#Controversies).

When DRC held its first elections, Patrice Lumumba was elected prime
minister, and Joseph Kasa-Vubu was elected president. On this, King
Baudouin said, "The independence of the Congo constitutes the
culmination of the work conceived by the genius [sic] of King Leopold
II, undertaken by him with tenacious courage and continued with
perseverance with Belgium." This is no different from the rhetoric
spewed by Emmanuel Macron saying that Africa should be grateful to
France for keeping [democracy](/democracy) via deployment of French
forces. See these news

- BBC: [Macron accused of 'contempt' over Africa remarks](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4xej8n7wxo)
[Friendship](/friendship), if it were even real to begin with,
immediately crumbled between Patrice Lumumba and Joseph Mobutu, when
powers-that-be like US, UN, and Belgium backed the latter with force and
finance to overthrow the former. In the end of his life, Lumumba was
tortured, shot dead, and chopped up.

Mobutu would execute his second coup, this time against Kasa-Vubu who
the presidency in their May 1965 elections. Mobutu would pillage for
another 32 years, like Leopold did. After Mobutu was thrown to exile,
[Laurent-Désiré Kabila](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurent-D%C3%A9sir%C3%A9_Kabila), was sworn into presidency. Kabila, it turned out, was just like him.

## Digging for cobalt as a way of living

Most people in DRC's mining communities are eternally tied and forced to
do something was never meant to be their, or anyone else's, way of
living.

A thin layer of dried sulfuric acid covers the northern part of the town
Tenke. During the processing of heterogenite, sulfuric acid is used to
separate the copper and cobalt, producing hydrofluoric acid, sulfur
dioxide, and sulfuric acid, which [CMOC]((https://en.cmoc.com/) (China
Molybdenum Company) does not contain.

In this dire and toxic conditions, [violence](/violence) is a means of Congolese
people to free themselves. It's interesting when we question how
oppressed people deal and use violence, as if to imply that only certain
types of people are allowed to monopolize it.

Night markets for cobalt trading between artisanal miners and
*négociants* further muddy the supply chain by "laundering" artisanally
mined cobalt (i.e., cobalt mined through slavery) into the more formally
industrially mined cobalt, out of sight.

Congolese people, Kara argues, will continue to suffer under their
government thievinga the fruits of their labor. Political elites
here and elsewhere will not give up any power they inherited from the
colonialists and imperialists. It is up to the people to [take this power back](/revolution).

To control the flow of information goinf out of Tilwezembe, one of the
smaller mining sites in Lualaba Province, the Republican Guard strikes
fear and paranoia to the artisanal miners through intimidation,
[surveillance](/surveillance), and violence.

Child slavery is being used to dig hazardous tunnels in Tilwezembe, to
mine heterogenite using only hand tools, small headlamps, and raw human
power. Many children have been buried alive; few survived.

## Death in cobalt mines

The influx of foreigners does bring gentrification to an area,
especially if they are economically better off. What is worse, though,
is when they also bring with them [destruction](/destruction), such as
in the case of foreign mining companies staking their claims in
Congolese land.

Author Kara somewhat believes in NGOs in Congo being present to help. It
might be that the staff do want to bring about change, but they have
limited capabilities to effect that. NGO workers (in Congo and
elsewhere) might:
- treat it as just work that pays the bills;
- work only within their scope or job description, no more, no less;
  and/or
- work for a management that is not fully transparent with how they are
  achieving their goals, if at all, as an organization.

FARDC soldiers recruit children from Kapata and other villages nea
Kolwezi to dig ores for them. These men would manipulate children into
entering slavery with the promis of a better life. Unfortunately,
soldieers use fear and violence to control the labor of these children.

There are Lebanese communities in Congo, because many of them believe
there's money to be had in trading copper and cobalt. It's also believed
that Hezbollah has their toes dipped in this trade to supposedly launder
money.

The system of trading cobalt is opaque and untraceable by design. It is
harder to scruitinize something if you cannot see the details.

Piece-rate wage shifts the market risks from employers to workers. All
sorts of contractualization, including and especially the informal
types, skirt many labor laws that were designed and passed to protect
the workers.

I cannot say whether it matters if one faces existential dread head on
uninhibited by alcohol---many of the Congolese artisanal miners are
always drunk---but being sober might help with being in the Now and in
retelling the story should one survive the risks of cobalt mining. In
Kasulo and other mining communities, money and death are served together
cold.
