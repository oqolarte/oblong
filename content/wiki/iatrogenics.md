## Intro

Iatrogenics is when a treatment causes
[more harm than benefit](/second-order-thinking).

Before intervening in a situation---be
it in personal [health](/health), [finance](/personal-finance),
[technology](/technology), etc.---it's
best to know as much as possible.
This includes predicting what the outcomes of our actions and inactions,
whether each would indeed be helpful or not.

## And then what?

... is a good question to ask.

We should only intervene when the benefits outweigh the negatives.

What should we control? We could look into limiting the following to
approach a more [antifragile](/antifragile) system:

- size
- concentration
- speed

Many people are still averse to hospitals and other similar healthcare
facilities, largely because they have been seedbeds of death. That, or it
is very expensive for most of us to really afford without plummeting to
destitution.

Author Nassim Nicholas Taleb argues that [capitalism](/capitalism) is
working in an inverse-iatrogenics. In dismantling or obsoleting it,
then, we would would have to prioritize both self- and [community care](/community):
helping one person empowers the another, creating a positive feedback loop that ripples through the community.

## Principles of iatrogenics

1. **Evidence of harm is not needed for an unnatural thing to be
   considered harmful.** To fight the effects of harmful unnatural
   things, we could try to remove them from our lives and not add more,
   like pharmaceuticals.
2. **Effects of iatrogenics is non-linear.** Following this, we should
   encourage treatment only when the patient is very sick, because when
   they undergo treatment, it will have higher chances of working.
