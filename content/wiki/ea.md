It's when rich people decide to become ethical, and then fly in
philosophers in business class to tell them how to be so. They'll also
hire researchers how to be "efficient" about it.

Wait, that can't be it, right?

Let Cory Doctorow explain it via his blog post, "[A world without people](https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/05/fisher-price-steering-wheel/#billionaire-solipsism)" (emphasis mine):

> Effective altruism is the belief that one should make
> as much money as possible by working in the most exploitative and
> destructive fields you can find, in order to fund a program to improve
> the lives of 53 trillion *hypothetical artificial people* who will come
> into existence in 10,000 years.

We can distill effective altruism (EA) to movement that advocates for making
rational, evidence-based decisions to do the most good possible. Sounds
good in theory, until its proponents stop questioning the systems that
enable money to be the both the solution and the problem it creates.

EA, at its core, is just charity, subtly laced with colonialism and/or
white savior complex. I prefer [mutual aid](/mutual-aid)
over charity. EA works with data, and while data in itself can be
useful, [radical change](/revolution) can never be dependent on nor fit
any kind of human-made metric.
