We’re looking for 400-800 word original articles that capture the
hyperlocal conversations in your hometown, village, city, region –
anywhere beyond the Anglosphere. What’s really on everyone’s lips right
now? What stories, debates or everyday experiences are shaping life
where you live, but haven’t yet appeared in the English-language press?

You don’t need to be a professional writer to pitch. We welcome ideas in
languages other than English and will work with you on editing and
translation to bring your piece into the print magazine. We pay a flat
fee of £100 per article. 

We recommend reading the latest print issue to get a sense of the style
and scope of our Street Talk series before sending your pitch to:
submissions@translatormag.co 

Previous Street Talks have covered Belfast, Dublin, Jakarta, Hanoi,
Guadalajara, Yakutsk, Medellín, N’Djamena and Mbabane.

You can also submit your story idea via voice note to the Translator Mag
Hotline on Signal, WhatsApp or Telegram: +447519 137459.
