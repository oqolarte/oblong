## Bird talking

While I don't close myself to the idea of birding, I hadn't the
opportunity to explore it. The main reason is that I rarely found myself
in their presence growing up.

I don't doubt that they are quite interesting. I even talk about them
sometimes here:

- [More than a year ago](/158), one of our cats gave us a corpse of a
  bird, maybe as a gift.
- [Not long after that](/162), I hinted that they can be source of
  creative inspiration.
- [Then](/166), I started hearing their "songs."
- It would take [about a year for me](/266) to make a little effort to
  know the names that other humans gave them.

Today I will add talk to the list.

## What do we hear when we see birds?

I feel lucky to be in a place where birds visit us in the mornings. Our
plants and trees are their *tambayan* (a dedicated place to hang out). I
wonder, though, if the urban civilization has been kind to them. A
decent city life may be possible for some birds, like pigeons who have
adapted to the ubiquitous presence of humans. But how is it for the
other species?

If we were to contribute more to the local flora and fauna, it should
not stop at maintaining a safer haven in this concrete jungle. How else
might we rewild some space so that it would also benefit non-humans?

Like I said, I am starting to hear the birds "sing" but one could say
that it's in their nature to do that. But when can I hear the *plants*
"sing"? That is, will there even be a point in my life that I regain my
connection to the plants, the way my ancestors were, the way the
Indigenous Peoples are?

Last night, walking back home after dining out and crossing a bridge,
we spotted a bird perched on a trash island on a creek. It looked like a
gull, but I referred to it as a "water bird" based on the webbed feet.

Was it waiting for something there, perhaps a fish for dinner,
miraculously swimming along the plastic? Was it resting after a long
flight?

Poet William Cullen Bryant wrote *To a Waterfowl* after supposedly
seeing the titular bird flying its "solitary way[.]" His poem has
religious undertones.

On the contrary, I offer a more secular one to the water bird we saw:

## "Lightless Bird"

Confuse me, Night, not with lightless streams.  
What is there but the normal? *No*,  
we almost missed you---  
You, the water bird, flowerless fowl---  
on that spot below, abridged,  
looking weary, looking dull and dark.  
Looking up?  
Our eyes met.  
Did you mean to say something?  

You have found no promise land,  
only waste: human, death, machine.  
No fish. No wishes.  
Well, there used to be,  
one imagines.  
And like all streams  
and seas  
and all waterways between,  
they were sacred.  
Did you mean to say they still are?  
It was too dark to tell.
