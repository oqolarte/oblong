## Fermat's Last theorem

There are no whole number solutions in

\( x^n + y^n = z^n \) ; for \( n > 2 \)

## Background and history

It's to know that [mathematics](/math) has opened the flow of ideas, in most
cases. So, [Andrew Wiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wiles) must have been working with his white male
privilege to want to claim the solution for this theorem as his.

## Pythagoras, Pythagorean theorem, and spirituality of Number

[Pythagoras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras) developed the
idea of numerical logic---something that puts studying numbers and
discovering patterns in and around them a field of its own, robust against
human perception. [Pure] math then can exist unbothered by varying
opinions. Concepts in math can be [validated with proofs](/math-proofs), which can then
be used to build upon more complex concepts.

He exclaiemd that "All is Number," to mean, there is math explaining the
physical laws that govern nature. In fact, discovery in math means more
tools for scientists to explore their fields. For example, when Isaac
Newton had developed calculus, physicists around the world would use it
to understand and solve gravitational problems. (Side note: We often
attribute the discovery of calculus to Newton, but even Newton himself
admitted that he would not have developed it without having seen
Fermat's drawing of tangents. For more info, see
[*Fermat's Methods of Maxima and Minima and of Tangents*](http://users.uoa.gr/~apgiannop/Sources/Stromholm-Fermat.pdf))

Even in exact sciences, so long as there are humans with thoughts and
emotions of their own, the possibility of starting a [religion](/religion) is never
zero. All that to say that Pythagoras started his own Brotherhood, and
their idol is Number. Members of the Divine Brotherhood would search for
spirituality using early versions of [number theory](/number-theory).

Pythagoras also had thoughts about how numbers can be "perfect," which
depended on its divisors:

- [Abundant (or excessive) number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundant_number) is a natural
  number whose sum of divisors **is greater than** the number. For
  example, the first abundant number **12** has divisors (1, 2, 3, 4,
  and 6) which add up to 16 (and 16 is greater than 12).
- [Deficient (or defective) number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deficient_number) is a natural
  number whose sum of divisors **is less than** the number. For example,
  the number **10** is deficient because the sum of its divisors, (1, 2,
  and 5) is 8, which is less than 10.
- [Perfect number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number) is a
  natural number whose sum of proper divisors (also called [aliquot sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliquot_sum))**is equal to** the number. The
  first four perfect numbers are **6, 28, 496, and 8128**.
