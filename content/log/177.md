As an avid car disliker, be it the combustion or the much-hyped electric
types, attending the Manila International Auto Show (MIAS), for work no
less, led me to experience a dissonance for most of the day, one that
would eventually manifest itself in a splitting migraine. To be fair,
the migraine stemmed from other sources as well, like heat, dehydration,
hunger, fatigue---things that one must avoid while living in the
tropics, but which I tackled head on.

Anyway, I'm more of a bicycle enjoyer, so nothing there seemed relatable
in MIAS, not even the "sustainable" electric vehicles that would
supposedly "change the game."

Didn't we just go through a heavy traffic jam on our way
there? So why would people want to add more cars in the road?
Of course, we know that the answer to that is as clear as the summer
skies in an Early April morning.

If there would be a bicycle convention, perhaps I
could pitch it to our management that we attend that, too?
I'm sure though that it would get much less traction.
