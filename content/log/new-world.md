*Amoy asupre*.

Midnight comes,
and we reach the peak of this day's festivity
by lighting so many fireworks, as is the annual tradition.

The smell of sulfur that comes with it, though, reminds me
of early Jan 2020's Taal eruption,
when wind blew its ashes across nearby regions,
including ours.

We have been wearing face masks since then.
As is the annual tradition?
I hope not.

One can't help but be a little pessimistic,
especially when the local number of cases of Omicron-variant of COVID is on the rise.

The ~~new~~ better normal that everyone dreams of has just slipped a bit further
away, it seems.
