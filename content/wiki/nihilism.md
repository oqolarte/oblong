There's no end goal,
no demands to be met,
no programs to be followed---resistance thus being one of pure negation.
[We expect to go nowhere](/zemblanity) while the duopoly of State and Capitalism
holds us by our necks.
Still, [we should fight back](/violence) as a sort of final defiance act
against authority---*Blessed Is The Flame*[^tal-blessed] is a good read on this.
It's more so focused on acting in the moment,
negating the delusion of a future liberation that may never come,
holding that this sort of mentality prevents us from taking action now.

Looking for answer to poor questions like, "When will I die?" prevents
us from fully experiencing what's worth feeling in our remaining days.
To unlearn that there is a purpose liberates us from any expectations.
