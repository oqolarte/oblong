How music is experienced will be different for each person, so I cannot
possibly cover everything here. But I am merely writing down my thoughts
and observations on the matter.

## Familiar things

I am what people would call a Millenial coming from a lower-middle class
(if we are to believe that "middle" class exists). Music has always been
accessible to me through many organic ways: family playing guitar and
singing songs from their time; same family playing CDs of their
preferred genre; a perennial FM radio somewhere in the neighborhood
blasting love songs all day and all night; videoke hits that are
perpetually distorted by distance, odd audio mixing, or, usually, both,
splitting airwaves on special occasions.

Of course, as I grew older, I got into more sophisticated stuff: 

- mp3
players meant I could personally bring my music library with me;
- I learned to play guitar; then, smartphones became the all-in-one device
that happens to also play audio files;
- Spotify boomed to popularity with
its streaming service on demand.

Music is delivered from the
device to our ears via a number of implements: wired earphones, wired
headphones, each of their wireless counterparts, including bluetooth
speakers. Each of which meets a demand, from a casual listener to an
audiophile. I am sure I am leaving a lot out of this incomplete set.

## Random thoughts

Nothing wrong with singing out loud when I am alone. I *could* go to a
videoke bar, rent a small stall for myself, and sing my heart out, but
that all of that entails spending money on a hit-and-miss sound system,
when I could have just [breath fire](/178) on my own for free.
Obligatory [quoting of myself](/285):

> By no means am I a good singer. But I grew up in a household that
> prioritized music and singing, so that was instilled in me early on.

## Time traveling

Hearing a particular music, for me, connects me to the last instance that I heard it. It's not quite as strong as the reliving memories triggered by smell, but it *is* quite an experience. When artist Jean-Michel Basquiat said "music is how we decorate time," it is no stretch to imagine it as a time-traveling device that can be personalized to our life.
