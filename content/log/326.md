After more than a week into this [stomach] acid-induced suffering, I am
now finally feeling a bit better, thanks mostly to taking omeprazole and
some pain relievers, and avoiding caustic food, which is quite a list
according to the last gastroenterologist who checked me.

I will skip the boring details of how I had to "quickly" visit to ER
last Sunday for experiencing intense pain around the belly button that
would not subside.

This ordeal revealed how fraught it was to go through medical facilities
*alone* and in agony while facing seemingly unsympathetic male
healthcare providers. Even though I am lucky to have an amazing support
system, bad luck and bad timing played harder this time.
