Woke up early,
expecting to start the day right,
only to come to an air polluted by open burning.

That's not right.

## Clean Air Act?

> All potential sources of air pollution (mobile, point and area sources) must comply with the provisions of the law. All emissions must be within the air quality standards.
>
> Mobile sources refer to vehicles like cars, trucks, buses, jeepneys, tricycles, motorcycles, and vans.
>
> Point sources refer to stationary sources such as industrial firms and the smokestacks of power plants, hotels, and other establishments.
>
> Area sources refer to sources of emissions other than the above. These include smoking, burning of garbage, and dust from construction, unpaved grounds, etc.[^caa]

## Waste Management

Apparently, it's hard to enforce this when people are not empowered to do
something about, say, preserving the environment;
or---I don't know---have the basic decency to not pollute the neighbor's
breathing air.

Waste management is still an underrated topic in many developing nations.
One would think this is such an obvious---basic, even---problem to tackle,
but it quickly becomes complex when we factor in the public's disinterest
and lack of sense of urgency.[^burning]
