When Kamias tree bears fruits, it is *so* generous that much of it
just goes to waste. Not unless we make a sweet jam out of it!

**Preparation time: about 90 minutes**

## Ingredients

- Surplus of kamias fruits
- your preferred sugar (I used brown sugar)

## Step 1: Gather fruits in bowl and wash in water

## Step 2: Slice of both ends of each fruit

## Step 6: Mix sugar and sliced fruits in a pot

The original recipe calls for 1:1 kamias-sugar ratio, but I found that
to be too sweet.

This particular harvest yielded about 3.5 cups of kamias. I added 3 cups
of sugar.

**Adjust to your preference.**

## Step 7: Start heating and bring to boil

**No need to add water**. The fruit will
begin to perspire its own juices once there is heat.

**Constantly stir the pot** to avoid burning of sugar.

## Step 8: After boiling, simmmer for 20 minutes

**Constantly stir the pot** to avoid burning of sugar.

## Step 9: Turn off heat and let it cool

## Step 10: Bottle and store!

Best served with warm pandesal or toast, and your preferred hot beverage.
Combining with peanut butter also
adds depth and richness to flavor of both spreads.
