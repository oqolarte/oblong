- Removed unnecessary emojis in most, if not all, of the pages.
I realize now that they only add clutter.
- New section in [Site](/site) where I briefly discuss Typography.
- Added the dotfiles I used for the [Old Computer Challenge](/old-computer) last
  month.
- Added ten new entries and four new one-liners in [Imbentori](/imbentori).

Copypasta humor about construction,
one of the industries that directly opposes Life for various reasons:
> Not all construction work is equally enjoyable.
For example, enlarging a drilled hole is boring,
but fastening pieces of metal together is riveting.

I'd like to think that I'm a laid back person
with a generalist-at-best mental aptitude.

Abstract ideas always lure me in
and, perhaps as a consequence,
I almost always have an aversion
to concrete things like... Most of Reality.
I might have delved into kiddie solipsism
when I was in preschool,
the details of which I vaguely recall now,
only the feeling.

That's why I like broad abstractions like Math, Physics, and Post-structuralism,
although it's a shame that I never got around
going deeper into any of it.
Maybe in the future, I will.
I'd like to learn still, after all,
so there's nothing stopping me,
except bills to pay and food to obtain.

What's weird is,
I never enjoyed thinking about anything that much.
Wait, let me rephrase:
I can only allocate so much of my mental capacity
at any one endeavor for a period of time.
After that, I'll have to do something else to recharge my interest.
I do overthink about some things from time to time.
But I'd rather delegate what I can to others,
if it weren't for the fact that I don't want to bother people.
