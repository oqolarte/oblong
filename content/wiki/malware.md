Malware is software designed to harm devices or networks.

## Common attacks

Some of the most common types of malware attacks today include: 

Viruses
: Malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause
damage to data and software. A virus needs to be initiated by a user
(i.e., a threat actor), who transmits the virus via a malicious
attachment or file download. When someone opens the malicious attachment
or download, the virus hides itself in other files in the now infected
system. When the infected files are opened, it allows the virus to
insert its own code to damage and/or destroy data in the system.

Worms
: Malware that can duplicate and spread itself across systems on its
own. In contrast to a virus, a worm does not need to be downloaded by a
user. Instead, it self-replicates and spreads from an already infected
computer to other devices on the same network.

Ransomware
: A malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an organization's data
and demand payment to restore access.

Spyware
: Malware thatâ€™s used to gather and sell information without
consent. Spyware can be used to access devices. This allows threat
actors to collect personal data, such as private emails, texts, voice
and image recordings, and locations.

## Notable attacks

To understand [cybersecurity](/cybersecurity) attacks in the digital age,
below are two notable attacks that relied on the [internet](/internet):
the LoveLetter attack and the Equifax breach.

### LoveLetter attack

In the year 2000, Onel De Guzman created the [LoveLetter malware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ILOVEYOU) to steal
internet login credentials. This attack spread rapidly and took
advantage of people who had not developed a healthy suspicion for
unsolicited emails. Users received an email with the subject line, "I
Love You." Each email contained an attachment labeled, "Love Letter For
You." When the attachment was opened, the malware scanned a user's
address book. Then, it automatically sent itself to each person on the
list and installed a program to collect user information and passwords.
Recipients would think they were receiving an email from a friend, but
it was actually malware. The LoveLetter ended up infecting 45 million
computers globally and is believed to have caused over $10 billion
dollars in damages. The LoveLetter attack is the first example of
[social engineering](/social-engineering).

### Equifax Breach

In 2017, attackers successfully infiltrated the credit reporting agency,
[Equifax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Equifax_data_breach).
This resulted in one of the largest known data breaches of
sensitive information. Over 143 million customer records were stolen,
and the breach affected approximately 40% of all Americans.

The records included personally identifiable information including
social security numbers, birth dates, driver's license numbers, home
addresses, and credit card numbers. From a [security](/security)
standpoint, the
breach occurred due to multiple failures on Equifax's part. It wasn't
just one vulnerability that the attackers took advantage of, there were
several. The company failed to take the actions needed to fix multiple
known vulnerabilities in the months leading up to the data breach.

In the end, Equifax settled with the U.S. government and paid over $575
million dollars to resolve customer complaints and cover required fines.
