Slow productivity tackles meaningful work sustained over a long period
so as to avoid exhaustion and/or burnout. Nothing can be done quickly
*and* safely. Efficiency causes unforeseen harm. Being safe and secure
means going at it slow.

[Meaningful changes](/revolution) don't necessarily happen overnight,
so might as well
embrace Time and factor it in the work we our doing (or not doing).

## Slow Tech

Our strides in [technology](/technology) lead many of us believe that
solving certain problems must be quick now, or else, what's the point?

Someone who stayed in our home snarked on our manual coffee grinder,
visibly being sarcastic about how it's slow living in the Major Urban
City. Maybe it's lost on them that even if we can obtain a high-speed
grinder, we have chosen to be intentional in some of our
tasks, including making a cup of coffee. At the end of the day, though
worlds apart, caffeine is the
[ansible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansible) that united us,
so all cool.

## Procrastination

In a [capitalistic society](/capitalism) addicted to productive and
efficient motions, our last defense mechanism is procrastination:
letting thingstake care of themselves with little to no intervention
from us. It can be use to filter things that one really wants or needs
to do.

Mysteriously, significant signals have a way to reach you. On a larger
time scale, like annually, signal to noise ratio seems to get even. But
as one zooms to hourly, there is more noise. This is evident in news and
current affairs cycles.
