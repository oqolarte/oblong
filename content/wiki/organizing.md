## Tools

Tools, in whatever form they take, are an integral part of how we
organize for whatever cause or advocacy we believe in.

There is a balance to be made between not getting caught in analysis
paralysis in choosing the "right" tools, and using the very
exploitative tools (*coughs* [social media](/social-media) *coughs*)
that people-in-power use on us to keep us in check.

### Internet presence

Social media is an important topic here, in my opinion. Big platforms
like Facebook and Instagram are the obvious choice of NGOs, because each
reaches a lot of people, for the fact that many people are using these
in their daily lives. Moreover, the idea of a democratized internet is
continously being eroded by these companies, wanting to fence and
gatekeep as much "content" and information as possible within their
platforms, so much so that many people think that, say, Facebook is the
internet.

Securing a domain name and a website is not prioritized, particularly
among smaller groups who do not have big funding backing them up.
Such groups are missing out on having the control to what they can post,
instead of delegating it to the whims of our technofeudal lords at
Silicon Valley.

[POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) (Publish (on your) Own Site,
Syndicate Elsewhere) is a decent compromise between using social media
platforms in conjunction with a dedicated website or blog.
