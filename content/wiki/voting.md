It doesn't really matter whether you vote or not.
The problem isn't the people who want to vote, and it's not the people
who don't want to vote. It's the people who feel the need to keep
starting fights about it.

The state will still do everything to remain in power.

Who controls the information under [capitalism](/capitalism) on whom to
vote if not the wealthy executives? Who sets the options if not
capitalists who have done everything to fund the state to do its thing.

## So *vote*

...really, without snark and judgement, if it's important to you.
Some people argue that it can be a
form of harm reduction, that is, we can vote people that are more
aligned with our values and beliefs. If you are from this crowd, know
that there are people you can't convince, and the time and energy you
spend trying could be better spent bringing [real change](/revolution).

Personally, if I'd vote, it would be symbolic. It's likely that the
ruling class will pick who they want anyways.

## Or don't vote

...if you believe we have more important things to do than
filling out a ballot. Note to people in this side: it helps no one if
you shame voting people, saying they "legitimize the system" and are
"complicit in genocide." Unfortunately, the reality is, at least as of
now, someone is going to still be in charge. Voting (or not) is just one
strategy.

What matters more are the things that we do in our daily lives that can
directly impact those around us. Arguing about it does nothing but drown
out important conversations about organizing and fighting the system.
