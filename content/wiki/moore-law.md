I first encountered Moore's Law on a show in Discovery Channel.

Moore's Law talks about how [computer](/computer) chips get faster and cheaper over time.

Not really a law known by science.
It's more of a correlation observed that the number of transistors
in a dense integrated circuit doubles some 18 or so months.
