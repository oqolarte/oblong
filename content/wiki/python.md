Python is considered to be a general
[programming language](/programming) that is used to create a wide variety of
programs.

Python is typically used to build websites and perform data analysis.
In [cybersecurity](/cybersecurity), it's mainly used to automate tasks.

## Best practices for naming variables

- Use only letters, numbers, and underscores in variable names. Valid
  examples: `date_3`, `username`, `interval2`
- Start a variable name with a letter or underscore. Do not start it
  with a number. Valid examples: `time`,  `_login`
- Remember that variable names in Python are case-sensitive. These are
  all different variables: `time`, `Time`, `TIME`, `timE`.
- Don't use Pythonâ€™s built-in keywords or functions for variable names.
  For example, variables shouldn't be named `True`, `False`, or `if`.
- Separate two or more words with underscores. Valid examples:
  `login_attempts`, `invalid_user`, `status_update`
- Avoid variables with similar names. These variables could be easily
  confused with one another: `start_time`, `starting_time`,
  `time_starting`.
- Avoid unnecessarily long names for variables. For instance, don't
  give variables names like `variable_that_equals_3`.
- Names should describe the data and not be random words. Valid
  examples: `num_login_attempts`, `device_id`, `invalid_usernames`
