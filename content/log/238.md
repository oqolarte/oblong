- Done rereading Nassim Nicholas Taleb's book, *Antifragile*, which took
  more than half a year for me to complete. I [took notes this time](/antifragile).
- Edited [blogroll](/blogroll).

Let me agree with that one internet comment that December already feels
like 18 months in.

All I have for now are scattered thoughts, many of which are excerpts
from my journal, that I can't weave into a coherent narrative.

- With the rise of social media cloning (its threat actors locally known
  as "posers"), if/when I make an account in any one of the biggest
  platforms, I'll try to not even include a picture.
- **Pros prise pros**, especially when it comes to packing things
  efficiently into a tight space.
- Apart from old brutalist buildings in my line of sight, the sky has
  been mostly gray recently due to the colloidal mix of urban smog and
  volcanic ash, the latter drifting from the mouth of Mt. Taal. Rain
  sometimes fall, turning asphalt roads into long strips of obsidian
- [Politics](/politics) is all about optics, if we want to be real about
  it. Nothing inherently wrong about that. But the question is, how do
  we apply the politics into our day to day lives? We want to be seen
  doing something for the greater good, yes?
- I tried visualizing myself hugging a much younger version of me.
- A recent nightmare had me incensed for being unable to escape from
  something or someone determined to home in on me no matter what.
