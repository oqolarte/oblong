I refuse to be stuck in a loop of [internally?] screaming life away,
but it can be hard to escape its pull, to snatch myself back into
present. Heavier things, I'm told, are harder to steal.

Mind: empty. Thoughts: 0. At this fleeting moment of non-philosophical
musing, if you split my head open, there's only the risk of rage
animating the self to open-fire inbound by way of old-fashioned fists
and fangs, the greatest hits delivered between the ears.

Still, I show up along with other people, even if I do nothing else
except be present in the[ir] moment. In solidarity.
