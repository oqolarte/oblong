## Fermat's Last theorem

There are no whole number solutions in

\( x^n + y^n = z^n \) ; for \( n > 2 \)

## Background and history

It's to know that [mathematics](/math) has opened the flow of ideas, in most
cases. So, [Andrew Wiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wiles) must have been working with his white male
privilege to want to claim the solution for this theorem as his.

## Pythagoras, Pythagorean theorem, and spirituality of Number

[Pythagoras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras) developed the
idea of numerical logic---something that puts studying numbers and
discovering patterns in and around them a field of its own, robust against
human perception. [Pure] math then can exist unbothered by varying
opinions. Concepts in math can be [validated with proofs](/math-proofs), which can then
be used to build upon more complex concepts.

He exclaiemd that "All is Number," to mean, there is math explaining the
physical laws that govern nature. In fact, discovery in math means more
tools for scientists to explore their fields. For example, when Isaac
Newton had developed calculus, physicists around the world would use it
to understand and solve gravitational problems. (Side note: We often
attribute the discovery of calculus to Newton, but even Newton himself
admitted that he would not have developed it without having seen
Fermat's drawing of tangents. For more info, see
[*Fermat's Methods of Maxima and Minima and of Tangents*](http://users.uoa.gr/~apgiannop/Sources/Stromholm-Fermat.pdf))

Even in exact sciences, so long as there are humans with thoughts and
emotions of their own, the possibility of starting a [religion](/religion) is never
zero. All that to say that Pythagoras started his own Brotherhood, and
their idol is Number. Members of the Divine Brotherhood would search for
spirituality using early versions of [number theory](/number-theory).
For more info, start with the following articles:

- [Brotherhood of Pythagoras: Beyond Math, Insights into Ancient Wisdom](https://www.ancient-origins.net/human-origins-religions/brotherhood-pythagoras-0021056)

Pythagoras also had thoughts about how numbers can be "perfect," which
depended on its divisors:

- [Abundant (or excessive) number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundant_number) is a natural
  number whose sum of divisors **is greater than** the number. For
  example, the first abundant number **12** has divisors (1, 2, 3, 4,
  and 6) which add up to 16 (and 16 is greater than 12).
- [Deficient (or defective) number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deficient_number) is a natural
  number whose sum of divisors **is less than** the number. For example,
  the number **10** is deficient because the sum of its divisors, (1, 2,
  and 5) is 8, which is less than 10.
- [Perfect number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number) is a
  natural number whose sum of proper divisors (also called [aliquot sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliquot_sum))**is equal to** the number. The
  first four perfect numbers are **6, 28, 496, and 8128**.

Tale as old as time: cult leader Pythagoras could not accept the
existence of irrational numbers, because he himself was actually
irrational for believing that the universe would bend to his ideals that
"All is Number," that everything can be explained by beautiful whole
numbers and fractions. In the end, he could not fully accept the rigors
of mathematics.

## French Mathematicians

French (Parisian) mathematicians used to be secretive with their
calculations. This was because of how their reputation relied on
guarding their methods, which was incentivized by the prestige of coming
up with their own clever ways of calculating, say, complex accounting
problems. Imagine, though, what would happen [if they had open-sourced their ways](/osint).
This individualism, I think, is more persistent in western cultures.

Blaise Pascal believed that religion is a gamble worth playing. And he
related his rationale to how players feel when betting. If paradise is
inifinite happiness and contentment, then it could be infinitely
exciting, no matter how little, the chance of "winning" is.

## Euler's breakthrough in Fermat's last theorem

Leonard Euler found a major breakthrough in Fermat's last theorem when
he explored Fermat's notes on a proof by contradiction called [method of infinite descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_infinite_descent).
Details of which can be found in [this section of the related Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem_for_specific_exponents#n_=_3).

Euler's proof at /( n = 3 /) also proves the cases of /( n /) that's
multiple of 3. The number 3 is also a prime number. This meant that
proving Fermat's last theorem was "reduced" to just the prime numbers of /( n /)
because composite numbers comprise primes.

Sure, there are infinite prime numbers, but at least it is "less than"
all infinite whole numbers. Speaking of infinite numbers,
[Euclid's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_theorem)
states that there are indeed infinite prime numbers. (Proof is on the
linked Wikipedia page)
