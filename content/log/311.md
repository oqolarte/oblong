The short EP by Ourselves the Elves (OTE) is sonically consistent from
start to finish. It feels---and *is*---familiar, like a friend you have
known for years now, telling you about their multifaceted love lives.
This is not the first nor the last time you will be hearing about them,
but you listen anyway.

**Rating**: 3 🗺️ out of 5
