## Ideal Phone

Inspired by [Thomasorus](https://thomasorus.com/my-ideal-phone.html),
below is a list of specs in my ideal phone.
I'm not sure though how likely these components would work together,
or what I'm asking would even be possible.

### Hardware

- Physical keyboard like Blackberry phones
    - I personally use QWERTY layout, but it would be nice if the
      keyboard layout could be remapped programmatically.
- Physical switch for toggling radio waves on or off
- Small OLED *or* e-ink screen with a decent refresh rate, maybe within
  2.5" to 3.5" range
- A camera for scanning QR, bar codes, and maybe the occasional paper
  document
- Anywhere between 80 - 16GB of internal memory
- Has a microSD slot for expanded storage
- Anywhere between 6 - 8GB RAM
- With 3.5mm headphone jack
- Rechargeable and removable Li-Ion battery, between 1500 - 2000 mAh
- USB-C port

### Software

- [AOSP](https://www.androidauthority.com/aosp-explained-1093505/)
- Able to make calls and texts
- A media player, for audio and video
- Utility apps like:
    - Maps
    - Calendar
    - Calculator
    - Notes
    - Dictionary
    - Time keeping (including clock, alarm, stopwatch, timer, world
      time)
    - Instant E2EE messenger, preferably [Signal](https://signal.org)
    - Reader
    - Music player
    - Video player
    - Audio recorder
    - Optional: minimalist (as in HTML + CSS only) browser
    - Optional: RSS reader
