## Pusoy Dos with friends

We hung out with friends and played Pusoy Dos with them. We think it's
one of, if not *the*, best games for four people using 52-card deck,
with its quick turnaround time, demand for wits, and most important,
call for trashtalk.

## Brief review of *Adolescence* (2025)

We finished watching *Adolescence* (2025). It tells about how any child
might still spiral down into antisocial behaviors despite having a
nurturing nuclear family back home.

Impressionable kids are constantly exposed to an unloving and uncaring
communities that are beyond the influence of their families. I don't
have the answers, and neither does the show, but if I were to guess: we
should start with everything everywhere.

More relevant things to think about: We need to ask ourselves whether we are
creating and fostering spaces for kids and allowing them explore the
world around them causing as little harm as possible.

## Building emergency go-bag

*(NOT a how-to)*

After the recent [March 2025 Myanmar earthquake](https://www.unhcr.org/emergencies/myanmar-earthquake),
we are again thinking about planning for emergencies, something we should
have done a long time ago as residents of Ring of Fire, unwilling
neighbors to fault lines, and frequent recipients of typhoons.

Building an emergency go-bag, we now realize, is an expensive endeavor
that requires planning and discussion.

Some curious questions we have asked so far:
- What can we get second-hand? E.g., rain jackets and waterproof
  backpacks can be obtained used, but definitely not perishables.
- We would have to also build go-bags for our pets, but I wonder how
  quickly can we fetch all of them in an emergency?
- How could we start organizing the neighborhood so that we could set up
  a local [mutual aid](/mutual-aid) in case of a calamity?
