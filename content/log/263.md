## Brief review of *Doppelganger*

Naomi Klein deftly weaves different ideas into one coherent and relevant
string of insights. Indeed, what a non-boring "trip into the Mirror
World," where our shared realities, though not exactly the same, might
be twisted beyond recognition depending on what sets of beliefs one
might have.

Of course, all the ideas about the Mirror World are relevant here in the
local politics of the so-called Philippines, constantly baked fresh by
our DDS, BBM, Kakampink, NDF (*et. al.*), and demsoc peers across the
entire political compass. The onus is on me, actually, to keep up but I
can't and won't, lest I wither away in helpless anger.
