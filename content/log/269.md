## Wake up choking

It's not fun waking up to a thick burning smell that blankets
everything. At this point of transitioning to consciousness, anything
that is urgent, whether real or not, forces the brain to boot into a mad
scramble of unhealthy what-ifs.

I am talking about the
recent case of Montalban landfill fire.

In GMA Integrated News report "[Fire hits landfill in Rizal, smoke reaches QC](https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/topstories/metro/944260/fire-hits-landfill-in-rizal-smoke-reaches-qc/story/)", a fire inspector explained what they dealt with:

> Fire in the landfill usually came from the bottom. To extinguish it,
> we dug some dirt using heavy equipment like a backhoe and bulldozer
> and covered the areas where there was fire or smoke.

## The mad scramble of what-ifs

As I have had more time to process what happened, several things came to
mind.

One: it's good that we have been building up, slowly but surely, each of
our own emergency go-bags. Since we have furry friends living with us,
we are planning on assembling pet go-bags as well.

Two: Where do go in case air pollution worsens? Logistics, especially
with multiple pets, has never been a priority. Asking for a neighbor's
help is even trickier. And so, in case of emergency, how do we take the
animals with us?

Three: We made do with wearing two layers of KN95 (because one somehow did not
do it) so that we could breathe properly through the smog. Sadly, we
have no way of offering the same for our furry friends.
