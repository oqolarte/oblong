- Changed the status of [Imbentori](/imbentori) project to "on-going."
This is because I'm now in the slow and long process of migrating some of the posts from my old Tumblr blog to this site.
Ten new (old) entries are up.
Now, excuse while I cringe at my old writing style.
- [OpenBSD 6.9](https://openbsd.org) has been available since May Day.
I just updated my soon-to-be [Server](/server) using `sysupgrade`.
A nice experience indeed.
Still getting around to setting that up, though, so there's that.

I'm having trouble with setting up the server.
I couldn't figure out the DNS thingy.
The afternoon heat doesn't help.
There's barely a moment to focus or reflect on any of the things that I'm currently on, because of the heat.

Global temperature is likely to be like this.
It might even get worse each year.
