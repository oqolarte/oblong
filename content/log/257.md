- Edited the front-matter script in [Wiki](/wiki-meta) project.

A mass was organized at the Baclaran church yesterday for the
[desaparecidos](/216) which my partner and I attended.

It's way past the month of February, and most of my time is spent in
solidarity with people I care for. Sometimes, that means getting out
there, listening to a homily, even though I haven't considered myself a
practicing Catholic Christian for a long, *long* time. To make up for
this lack of faith, we settled on being present in whatever homily we could
attend, and rank and review all the homilies in an unwritten list.

Last Sunday's main message was "Love your enemies," from the gospel of
[Luke 6:27-38](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%206%3A27-38&version=NIV),
which might well be one of, if not *the*, highest forms of
[transformative justice](/transformative-justice).

The priest who gave the homily synthesized this message to an earlier
reading of [1 Corinthians 15:45-58](https://www.bible.com/bible/116/1CO.15.45-58), particularly
about how we are first "earthly" creatures before becoming "heavenly"
ones. He said (non-verbatim):

>  Liking someone is earthly. Loving someone is *supernatural*, that is
>  heavenly. It is okay to dislike someone because of differences: in
>  beliefs, personalities, politics, etc. But to hate someone is also
>  supernatural and in fact *evil*.

It's almost poetic in how the priest tried to explain in as simple an
English as he can.

If I had to guess, maybe love and hate don't exist in other life forms
so these two complex states of becoming is not natural to them, but
don't quote me on that.

And of course, these two verses can have a more secular interpretations,
which honestly can be twisted by [social engineers](/social-engineering) to manipulate other people, or to justify problematic behavior.

For me, I will remain with my earthly, natural space here and now, where
I can try to practice transformative justice, because at this point,
loving your enemies is nigh impossible. I can't imagine how it must be
for the families of the desaparecidos.
