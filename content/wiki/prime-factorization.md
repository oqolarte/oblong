[Integer factorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization):
\( p \times q = n \)

If *p* and *q* are prime numbers, it's now prime factorization.

## Assumption

It's easy to know *n* simply by multiplying *p* and *q*.

It's hard to know *p* and *q* by prime factorization knowing only *n*.

This assumption is used in [RSA algorithm](/rsa-algorithm).
