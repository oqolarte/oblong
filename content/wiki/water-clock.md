A **water clock** or **clepsydra**
is any timepiece by which time is measured by the
regulated flow of liquid into (inflow type)
or out from (outflow type) a vessel,
and where the amount is then measured.

If viscosity is neglected,
the physical principle required to study such clocks is
[Torricelli's law](/torricelli-law).
