Because much of my waking hours throughout the week is spent at Work, my
recent thoughts currently revolve around that, whether I like it or not.

## Steady income promotes consumerism

There is no going around it: having a "steady"[^work] flow of income
primes me to be a consumer. It manifests in how I behave during dull
times. I would pull up Carousell or Lazada, and window-shop for things I
think I need. No major purchases yet, but I do not want my time to be
consumed by that activity.

I would not say it is all my fault, though. After all, work leaves me
so exhausted, I do not have time to pursue my hobbies before. Buying
stuff, then, becomes this alluring quick fix to my problems.

[^work]: How steady would depend on my headspace to continue showing up.
*giggles*

What else is there outside of this tiring work apart from the so-called
obvious "rewarding oneself with fruits of one's labor," which, in the
[current dominant systems](/empire), means allowing oneself to
participate in consumerism? How we wish that said fruits be in terms of,
say, better and more inclusive public infrastructure and social
services. But the people in charge have yet to route public funds to
those. So I guess we are stuck with shopping.

## Debriefing at work

Huddling with colleagues at work, even virtually, can be its own healing
thing. This feels nice. The neck-breaking pace at which we operate is
physically and mentally taxing; it is good to have some sort of support
group who also experiences that.

Work can certainly be a space to meet new friends, but past the hours of
operation, what happens to those interactions would depend on how often
colleagues talk and if so, how they are willing to see and make
connections not work-related. The aforementioned huddling has tackled
the latter *while at work*, and to me, it is an important step forward.
