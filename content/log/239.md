It's the Friday the 13th, and I have been thinking about what would have
been [second-order](/second-order-thinking) effect if I helped an old
man earlier at an al fresco eatery. But first, let me describe this
[Paresan](/63).

The place, being in a relatively busy place, attracts different all
kinds of people. And since it's open---physically and business-wise
operating 24/7---one is welcome to just sit on whichever stool is
vacant. It's bar-like design could either be conducive of conversations
with strangers or be just a nook where one could be alone, the city's
humdrum as background for one's musings.

Patrons all face the center, a small kitchen island of sorts where the
most common order is prepared, and behind it, the menu. Our usual order
is beef pares, and I'm glad the price hasn't changed in a year.

One of the customers was already seated, and just parked behind him was
his electric scooter. He seemed to be always gauging his surroundings,
always looking out for his scooter. It is a heavy thing, and I don't
suppose it would just coast without it being turned on first. But I
understand his being aware of the people around him.

Then, a curious old man sat beside him. The old man did not order any
food. Instead, he was curious about the electric scooter which he
surmised belonged to the
younger man. Old man asked younger man questions about it, and
younger man was respectful enough to entertain this whole social
interaction.

The cynic in me kept expecting something bad would happen from these two
strangers talking, but it was just that really---two strangers talking.
About electric scooter. Nothing to overthink. Old man seemed genuinely
curious; younger man seemed respectful. It matters to me to witness
humane interaction out in the field, despite the growing pessimism
in urban jungles, despite my own cynicism. How else can build our
[communities](/community) if we don't try striking random conversations with random
people?

Meanwhile, another old man entered and sat among the diners. He
kept bugging the customers and the servers
for free food.

Now, I don't think asking for food is bad. It depends on how
one does it.

This old man, in my view, had been spouting vile words when people
didn't give him what he asked for. I say "in my view" because I could
not understand most of the words he was slurring, and simply inferred
based on the words that I did, and from his and the other customers' body
language.

When I asked one of the servers, she confirmed this is a regular thing
with the [second] old man. She says, "Sometimes, customers would buy him food."
But it has turned into a charity, and this old man has been hassling the
eatery for free food, the server added.

Hunger, at least for me, is never a dignifying feeling. I always wonder
how do those that go hunger strike do it. Hunger is a universal feeling,
too, so I kind of get the bad mood the old man seems to be perennially
in, given his condition. On the other hand, by giving him free food, I
wonder whether I would be enabling his toxic behavior towards the dining
place as a whole.

And like most urban cynics, I minded my own business, and told my
partner who was with me the entire time to do the same.
