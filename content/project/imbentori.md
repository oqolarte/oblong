## Status: On-going {.statusOnGoing}

It may or may not have been obvious,
but people my age like to express themselves on the internet.

I was active on Tumblr, that you can still visit:

**[Imbentori](https://iooare.tumblr.com)**

A little while back, I even thought of parsing through the original text I have there, and publish them in some sort of a book...

I'm not throwing this idea permanently away.
It's just that I have more interesting things to tackle, in my opinion.

In the meantime, read the foreword I drafted some time ago for this would-be collection of personal essays.

## Foreword

The tongue that swirls with its perceived languages can only cope so much from the demands of diction.
*Imbentori*, then, is one own tongue's attempt to speak the library of tensions as they never unfold in one's mind.
It is a list of personal truths told with cryptic lingo
(or with International Art English[^bs], one could argue)
to add dimension to the mundane.

I wanted to tell stories, fiction or otherwise, that had shaped me definitively.
In some entries, though, there's no room for interpretation.
In any case, if you feel like the stream of thoughts challenge the way you read, *hmm*, then it's purpose didn't go off tangent.

"Which is what, exactly?" I hear you ask.

"Well," I mutter, racking my brain for *proper* wording.
"The intention of sharing this version of
my Youth---captured between 2012 and 2018---is to offer a perspective of someone who both despises the world,
yet remains hopeful of the people's capacity to kick-start a change, although they bore me at that."
And then you plop back on your chair, still unsatisfied with my ambiguous response.

You will notice quirks.
One of the most notable was how I refuse to capitalize letters that needed capitalization.
It's style;
you'll get over it.

It's tempting to edit away all the cringe parts,
but I think those parts are what makes this body of work,
if you can call it that,
unique.
Right now, I'll compromise by trimming *some* of the bad stuff.

If everything sounds strange,
it's because I had been in this odd phase.

### There's a free copy online

Most of them are lumped into what I call [Unscholarly Notes](https://iooare.tumblr.com/tagged/unscholarly-notes),
after a chapter in one of my favorite books by F. Sionil Jose.

[^bs]: Reminds me of a paper called [_"Bullshit Makes The Art Grow Profounder"_](http://journal.sjdm.org/19/190712/jdm190712.html) (Turpin et. al., 2019). 
Some 20(20) years ago when I last visited an art museum (or was it just gallery?), 
I couldn't help but roll my eyes on a lot of pieces' description cards that seemingly always include how the artist "explores" this or that.

## Selected Entries

The following are the entries that I like, with slight edits.

### Entry # 1
Date: Wed, 30 Oct 2013

Someone called me on the phone, but I didn't hear it
immediately, because I was too absorbed on the gyrating sound waves
coming out of the speakers. 
My music, Queen, was too loud, and the
speakers are of the modern tech, 
so that they don't do that magical
feedback every time a call or a text comes in my phone. 

You all know that, right? 
A few years back, speakers screech when a phone nearby
would receive something. 
Nowadays, they don't. 
They have killed the
magic.

I picked up the phone. The voice at the other end was raspy but *clear*.
It was one of the mistresses of the former landlord of the community
where I live in now. She said she was coming to pick up some of her old
clothes and to drop a few other things.

There are visitors who seemed wanting to stay, but I can't allow that. I
want to be at my own now, see what will happen. If she comes, and she
stays, and she waits for the landlord, the two of them will lock
themselves in their old room where they will make love for the rest of
the day. Why can't they just leave me in peace?

### Entry # 2
Date: Wed, 30 Oct 2013

Dear diary, today I watched more videos of people fucking each other. I
think it's called pornography or erotica, but it depends on the grade of
steam which confutes any discrepancy between the two.

These people surprised me with their whines. 
I don't get it. 
Am I
supposed to touch my genitals just to emulate what they were
experiencing? 
There was an order of preference that I have read
somewhere, 
but my not remembering when and where I found such an article
proves how sleazy can I be. 
What I know is that, I must do *it* with one
or more persons, but with whom?

I clicked on a panel that played a video of two girls shamed by an
"ex-convict" on an absurd level, 
and he got to ram his penis down their
throats for more than four minutes. 
It was moving like a piston. 
I felt
nervous for these people who have nothing
but their blessed bodies. 
Maybe this isn't entertainment but something
inhumane that feeds off the carnal desires. 
If I must really think about
it, I suppose it was not their choice to participate in such a graphic
scenario.

Sex workers puzzle me. I know I have no right to question their deeds,
but still, the nature of their work is beyond my comprehension. I feel
so dumb saying that.

Dear diary, I am lonely. 
I want to fight off the urge. 
I want to spend
the rest of the week cuddling in someone's arms. 
I don't need to take
cold baths, because life isn't a big porcelain bath tub, 
nor a playlist
of fetishes.

### Entry # 3
Date: Thu, 31 Oct 2013

On moments that I look out of the window, I see the glorious sky.
Everything is modernized. 
Everything looks hopeful, yet ugly, but only
if you looked long enough to see the details. 

### Entry # 4
Date: Thu, 31 Oct 2013

I wish I could cough up wonderful lyrics and come up with good guitar
chords to go with it. 

I wish to do a thousand tough push-ups for every mistake I make. 
That
way, I would be strong enough to endure future errors.

I wish to rebuild the walls I destroyed in order to get here, but it
seems that it's all too late now. 
Someone out there knows why.

### Entry # 5 
Date: Fri, 01 Nov 2013

People from the suburbs have vacated the other room. 
It is free from
dirt now. 
They have also cleaned it. 
Got rid of the pests that might
want to scurry about the floor. 
I am glad the room is all mine now.

The room lacks decorations and soft pillows. 
It would echo in here. 
It lacks inspiration, but it has me now. 
And now, I have it.

### Entry # 6
Date: Fri, 01 Nov 2013

Kill me not with admiration, and tell me I am the best person to have
entered your life ever. 
My guitar strings ache to be strummed, 
my boxes of mementos long to be remembered, but I don't care about them. 
I care about you. 

You who have brought yourself to your own knees. You whose
ponytail I held in place just so you could mourn and bow down before me.
I could set up a room for the two of us where we could strangle the milk
of life out of each other, but you chose to be free. 
And to be honest, that was your only option.

You chose to be with
your cats and your boy friends. 
I had nothing to do with them, so I, in
turn, chose to set you free, even if I wanted otherwise.

### Entry # 7
Date: Fri, 01 Nov 2013

My grandfather, who looked like Quezon, 
once belonged to a guerrilla force. 
They lived in the mountain
side, just like any other rebellion at the time. They boiled unripe
corncobs and cow bones they stole from the farms nearby for lunch. 
They
were outlaws. 
They wanted to throw the Japanese out of the country,
only that they failed to do so. 

Theirs were the stories of war against
alien adversaries who were more powerful. 
They were simpletons turned
militia who knew only a few things about war. 
If they wanted so bad to be an active threat to their opponents, they could
have constructed at least one smart plot. 
But they preferred to be
cowards hidden behind ferns and rocks.

He died at the age of 80. 
Everybody prayed their own versions of
lamentations at his funeral. 
I was not there. 
I did not even see him during his last moments, so damn me now. 

My mother regularly reminds us of her admiration for her father. 
In her own words,
he was the greatest man who lived. 
She told me how her mother
wept during the funeral, so much so that they laughed at her, 
saying she was
over-reacting.

### Entry # 8
Date: Sat, 02 Nov 2013

To the brother whose downfall is inevitable,

Your woman talked to me the other night, but I was not listening carefully. 
Did she say that you were destroyed by an old lady? 
That you broke into tears inside a taxi, because none of your
schemes worked out?

Old hags do tend to cause that.
Sometimes, they are too old for
emotions that they can't even handle themselves. 
They resort to a
so-called systematic deity whom they worship as much as they worship
their laundry. 
It is all helpless now. 

For you and for her, the old
widow.

The sparrows will soon take her and all of her possessions away. 
The last air she will breathe looms nigh before her.

### Entry # 9
Date: Sun, 03 Nov 2013

I can't promise not to be so anxious about the impermeability of jagged
things here in this wanton city, here in this side of the world. 
I can
lock myself up in a room with venomous dingoes and snapping Venus
flytraps, but tell me, can I really lock myself up in a room with
deranged weirdos? 
I cannot be the spark of some other lame people's thoughts. 
I, too, am suffering. 
I cannot be of some help to others, sorry about that.

Some other night, I was not thinking straight again. 
I think I was
capable of horrendous crimes that time. 
So instead of losing it, I got
myself jacked in the computer and played all of the piano concertos
repetitively, until I came back to my senses, and everything seemed
wonderful again.

### Entry # 10 
Date: Mon, 04 Nov 2013

Let it sit there in the mellow light. 
And let it be clear to you that it
is not yours, that thing. 
This is not a race that you could just break
into a run like you are going to make it to the finish line. 
If you run now, you will not make it. 
The finish line is only a perceived idea
through which we wish to project the kind of reality we wanted, the
goals we wish to get. 

So hear me out on this, and just let the thing sit
by itself. 
It is safely locked in here. 
The room is all
so-and-so-proof---nothing
goes in or out. 
Entirely vacuum sealed.

Now, step out of the room and close the door behind you. 

Good.

Listen to me. 
It is the pride in us that will bleed us to death. 
You are not owned by your pride. 
And you need to rack your brains if you
have to, just so you will remember that. 
If you have to jot these down,
do it, for tomorrow and the day after that and so on, there will be
difficult exams. Life is a practical test.

### Entry # 11
Date: Tue, 05 Nov 2013

Regardless of the hours of rest I give myself,
this quake in
my chest still would not die down.
My heart thrashes for no romantic reason.
And during its convulsive moments, I feel this fear might consume me.
Later this day, I might trace my steps
back into the previous night to see what I have done to feel so gutted
and spooked, although I highly doubt it would be of any help.

### Entry # 12
Date: Thu, 07 Nov 2013

On a night with the least expectations, 
someone might want to show up by the front gate. 
She could be a friend, her derelict vehicle behind her, 
engine vibrating in anticipation of a long senseless drive.

She might want to invite me in her car, and ask for advice: 
about how she was so doped that her mother found out;
about the terrible travails that almost diminished her mind to dementia.

I might say, "Get us out of here first." 
The tires would then screech. 

I might tell someone to go to the nearest bridge, 
preferably at least a mile long, 
and there we might just drive back and forth. 
But the bridge would not respond to such foolish actions. 

She might get tired of driving and just take me to her room instead.

Of course, no one will actually show up and demand my presence. 
None of this will ever happen.

### Entry # 13
Date: Thu, 07 Nov 2013

On several facets of human frailty that I fail to tamper with logic, 
a deep resentment in discussing them prevails. 
Is it because human that I am, that in order to function normally, 
I have to act as if my weaknesses are repulsive topics? 
But isn't that denial, enough a reason to be asking for psychiatric help? 

Well, I don't need help.
I'm doing good with my dull, simple life,
thank you very much.

### Entry # 14
Date: Sun, 10 Nov 2013

Gentlemen can't rack their brains.
Ladies won't do it for them.
The might has been passed back and forth, so that one day, no one will be
needing the other. 
We might all become asexual, and the only terrible
thing about that is not finding enough limbs to stimulate the genitals.

### Entry # 15: *the response to any dream is its own ending*
Date: Tue, 12 Nov 2013

I ask now for the wisdom of people hearing me out about this one
~~tiny~~ bit (Yes, my dead grandfather, you are one of them, so please
stop brushing my shoulder with your phantom hands.):

*TO DREAM* of someone every single night when the clock strikes nine at
the fall of all the bass with the banging in unison of all buttheads to
the tune of all that has collapsed and will be collapsing with an
angelic choir from the ripped-open heavens apart *IS* normal as long as
it does not leave me grasping for breath, right? 
My dreams are made of
sad stuff. 
When I wake up from one, I put a pillow between my legs and
hug another with my arms, because it's all I have. 
A bunch of
un-talkative pillows, all heat-less and disappointingly foamy. 
They have
phased out the feathery once. 
Too many geese and ducklings and mallards
had suffered.

I saw once a meme somewhere, asking what if the pillows recorded our
dreams and all we had to do is plug them to our computers in the morning
to see our them, if any, again.
Are they that stupid to not know that
all dreams have no substantial beginnings? 
Only endings.
Sometimes good,
but most of them just stop abruptly.

Once upon a time, I had many dreams of this particular person who
stopped jamming with me all of a sudden---and that is fine.
Maybe she
dreamed of other persons, too, who would be genuinely interested in the
good stuff of pop music she liked. My sister, upon witnessing me looking
so badly wrecked, decided one day to teach me a lesson on how to deal
with the feminine intricacy:
Snap out of it.

### Entry # 16
Date: Tue, 12 Nov 2013

Science never told us that deeply ingrained within the cosmic particles
the earth was made up of, are so much drudgery that when the godly forces
of Universe swirled it all up into a gargantuan sphere, 
the amalgam was
but a place abundant of disappointment. 
Disappointment that, if served
frequently in many a cold dose, will dissolve human faith.
Thus,
it isolates a person in a barren phenomena, a distant sanctuary of the
inner self, sometimes called madness.

### Entry # 17
Date: Wed, 13 Nov 2013

The roads that branch out to those distant havens are all awfully
pungent like rotten onion. 
So here's a useless lifehack: 
Be skeptical of
maps with X's on them, 
simply because they are stupid and do not belong
in this time and age. 
Only ancient topography had these large red marks on them.
They were created by humans for humans as imaginary goals with
no evident rewards, 
so they could feel free to be objective, 
be freed
from their doubts of existence, 
be ambitious despite the dull Sundays.
What use really is there of a map? The long roads are boring and tiring;
the short ones are swift and tasteless.

After thousands of years of improving technology, we still find
ourselves stuck and deserted in a different dimension.

### Entry # 18
Date: Wed, 13 Nov 2013

Despite the miseries the kid had gone through,
he managed to salvage
his childhood by talking to a toy.
He is his own true friend.
A bond was naturally formed between him and Himself,
idealistically unbreakable even at the toughest times.
He was seldom seen crying simply because he was seldom seen at all.
When he was locking himself up in his room, who knows what things he was doing there,
the miracles enchanting him there.
People were worried, but only because they don't understand.
And those who do never had enough time to pay him a visit.

The kid was bright, I must say.
He learned that people do not always see the world as he sees it,
and that it is his duty to understand them.

The sores still burn him throughout the years, but now he's too tough
for them. In fact, his toughness is so much for him to handle that it
grows out as patches of facial hair and untrimmed nails and
badly-attended hygiene. The sores itch him somewhere just above the
chest, but he's become tolerant now.

### Entry # 19
Date: Thu, 14 Nov 2013

I was pushing myself, tapping at the frontal lobes, hoping
to remember something they taught me almost twelve hours ago. I was the
new guy, one who gives the glass around a
circle of conversationalists.
We all drank the glass full of poison.

Laps later, talk got better.
At that time, I munched on meat served on the table when this scourge
started boiling in my stomach. The potion I had been passing around
betrayed me; the friend became the repulsive
adversary. In a blink, I was in the bathroom, throwing up.
The liquid rushing through the throat and nasal cavity made
painful spasms. Vomit dripped on my lips and in my nostrils.
I felt weak.

This guy on the mirror squinted his eyes at me.
He looked desolated and trapped. Too, he looked cool in that Joker shirt.
Next time I see him, I'd take him out into the real world.

I cleaned up my mess.
Peed after that. Went out and found my cousin waiting by the restroom door,
asking if I were still doing good.
I nodded and smiled and went to bed.

I try to recall what they told me, but all of those went with the gastric pulp down the reservoir of rejected principles (called toilet).

### Entry # 20
Date: Sat, 16 Nov 2013

It has been a long time since I was last aware of my being atop a floor
of some church. Maybe, in recalling it right now, it was the last time I
would ever be in a church, or any holy establishment for that matter.

At first, I was bashful coming out as a cross-breed of agnostic and
atheist, but the more I learned, the more certain I became, that relying
on faith alone would not be smart a strategy if one, such as I, were to
continue living in cussedness.

I dislike the overall ambiguity of it, mainly because of extremists and
militants who distort and/or obscure the truth; although I like the
religious holidays and how they are so good at briefly converting us
into ethical and kind beings, in whatever ways we know how, genuine or
not, before we return to our same old selves. During this
period, we are allowed to vocalize our hopes for humanity with minimal
judgmental feedback. Everybody suddenly can forgiving.
And here and there, lights would appear as adornments of the house, a welcome banner to accommodate
any spirit who would decide to lounge in and share some thoughts.

Some people give too much color to it, though, to a point that my eyes
have had enough of this abject misery. Here we are still with our
dumbness in tact, trying to make something out of nothing. Conjurers we
are not.

### Entry # 21
Date: Tue, 19 Nov 2013

Didn't go to the morning class.
Arrived late on the afternoon class, but it was fine.
The professor decided to not show up, and make us wait in vain instead.
Waited until the last class.

It was the hardest part, waiting.
It always has been.
Waited until my buttocks became sore in sitting.
Waited until my legs deserted my being for standing too long.

Stuck my head out for some colleagues who were playing crossword puzzle on a tablet.
They thanked me every time I got a word right.
Waited for the last class.
The raging current of boredom was made to take me away from the university, but it didn't.

And I waited still. Until the last class.
I was hanging around gay people giving lecture to straight dudes about
homosexuality, and I lingered long enough to hear everything they all
had to say.

I waited until finally, the wait was over.
When I stepped in the last class, a 30-page surprise exam was waiting for me in my desk.
"It's a joke," I thought, almost too loud.
It wasn't a joke. And the last professor for the day did not seem to be in the mood for bad jokes.
In 45 minutes I was done with the whole thing. Whether I took the
exam seriously was out of the question. It's a funny world we live in.
We wait for the wrong things to happen.

### Entry # 22
Date: Wed, 20 Nov 2013

When I think of how dashing I am,
I picture myself lost with the commuters waiting in the train station,
all well-dressed and well-mannered.

When I'm drunk, I dance while I pee.
I draw murals on bathroom tiles with urine,
and on the morning it would smell of ammonia.

I fan an old book on my nose and start sniffing its wasted years of abandonment,
the smell of aging vanilla diffusing profusely from its pages to the
air, renovating my deconstructed thoughts.
I try to record what I'm doing as drafts (not videos) on my phone.

I think I'm hot stuff, sometimes.
I think I'm all glam from head to toe, but it is all feigned.
No need now for brashness; I am fully aware of what I really am,
and it's really not that difficult to see.
I think of mysterious sounds droning somewhere to console me, but all that echoes back is a monotonous buzz.
It's all cheap cologne and thrift store clothes and perforated undergarments;
and the train station is really just a dark alley of bad crimes,
and the commuters are really just rats.
The joints are creaky when they shouldn't be.

I may feel pretty sometimes, but rainbows aren't going to last the whole day.
I'm just like everyone else, trying to be cool.

### Entry # 23
Date: Sat, 23 Nov 2013

Last Wednesday, I was already 30 minutes late for one of my classes,
but I lingered around the corridor, eyeing occasionally the glass door
behind which I should be, waiting for the professor to go out. You see,
almost always does he excuse himself to go out to fetch something. I saw
this as my opportunity to sneak in his class.

Go out he did, only when I least expected it. I fumbled for my phone and
acted to be waiting for something else, and I can only hope that he did
not recognize me as one of his students. I decided to chicken out. I
made up excuses and debated with myself, but in the end, I chickened
out. I was so close. Ridiculously so to have not carried on with this
stupid plan. Being late already means demerits, and not appearing at all
in this important subject only made me sink deeper into my own grave.
The lesson, I hope I know now, is to never back out, not now, not later
or ever.

### Entry # 24
Date: Tue, 26 Nov 2013

none of us could think straight, maybe it's because of
the libido setting in, or the lack of sense of responsibility, or the
vague feeling of abandonment. i don't know. i tried suppressing mine by
drinking lots of chilling fluids from the freezer, but my brain almost
got frozen. so i stopped searching for the things that might cure me of
my disease.

a not-so-close friend admitted she was a bit worried i might
get old faster than her, but i assured her that my gears are not rusty
yet. just three days ago, when i woke up, i did some push-ups. my gears
are not rusty yet. i did two sets of push-ups, five reps each, and i
felt good. but later that day, my shoulder blades started aching. my
pillows are all wet. how is that? my blankets, my bed sheets, my
notebooks, my bag, all wet, each one of them. drenched with gooey
substance. the smell is not evident, but with careful observation, one
can easily deduce that such could only come from the windows of one
abominable soul.

i know what you are thinking. but it *isn't* true. they
say words are powerful, but when they come from a tainted memory, words
can be deceiving. do not be fooled. learn how to read beyond the lines.
when i say my pillows are wet, i could mean my pillows were doused in
nightmarish sweat. think about it.

### Entry # 25: *50 years past bedtime*
Date: Sat, 30 Nov 2013

I will be your only medication when you reach the end of your career.
I will be the palpable, inexplicable aftertaste with which you will want
to harm yourself at the back of your tongue. I will not be toxic,
though. Therefore, there will be no harm. Simply, I will be needed, just
as one needs pills when one is feverish and unhealthy.

Preservation---for it is the old and golden that needs preserving;
instincts and memories flashed pseudo-permanently on films or photographic papers.
Sometimes we think of ourselves as a selfish bunch, but there is more to that.
Thoughts in sarcophagus, mummified, waiting to be unearthed by future
archaeologists.

Hopefully, after I bury these distractions, these murky musings---you, of
course, along with all of it---our descendants would take the time to dig
them up, to debunk the surrounding myths, to suffer from our
recklessness, and to procure among the ruins that glistening wisdom I
assumed to have possessed but never actually had.

### Entry # 26
Date: Sun, 01 Dec 2013

I have not yet involved myself in a physically intimate act,
sometimes crudely referred to as *having sex*, with another person.
Fuck me, right?

### Entry # 27: *Kb*
Date: Mon, 02 Dec 2013

Should drunk people go to church? They seem to be passionate about
begging for forgiveness.

I tried to lift myself up from the wooden floor but it's no use. It's
rather a good thing, exceptional even, that near me is a pen and a
notebook. This is written first before I typed it heavily into my hard
drive.

I ask too much forgiveness; I should be a pope or live a celibate life
or someone immune to the temptations of foreign flesh. I will use my
hand. Good thing that is not the case. I guess you were not born for the
likes of me.

When in the morning I wake up, you will still be in my mind. It works
only if you were just as partial to me as am I to you.

I tried writing, but nothing came out of my pen except drools and
spoiled sardines. What does that even mean? I hope you like those who
struggle to formulate proper thoughts from defiled beings, because if
not---too bad.

Instead of a lovely letter, it came out like this. You should've seen my
notebook, how aggressively I scribbled down the lines, not all too
hyperbolic for your taste, but given time, I think they will mean
something to someone someday.

The dog's been chirping the whole night, but how come? Dogs are not
created for this sort of thing. I have wondered enough to think where
you might be in this darkest hour, but I am not myself at this
minute. The likes of me cannot make advances because the likes of
me drop by to say hello a bit too late.

### Entry # 28
Date: Mon, 02 Dec 2013

Outside lies an interesting field. Acres of solitary people forming
point circles of commotion. Wanting to be heard or seen or sometimes
left out. Institutions for the misguided, for the zealots, and the
in-betweens. But I prefer Here, breathing comfortably around denizens
unwilling to choke me with their ideals. Here is a good place. Here you
aren't, you weren't, you won't be. Oh the joy of cumulative absence,
whatever it means to you!

### Entry # 29
Date: Wed, 11 Dec 2013

I ask myself if the idea of my mind being attuned to a sweet raspberry
voice I have never heard were reliable, that is, if paying heed to such
would be worth my while. Disconnect a lonely guy from the tranquil
comforts of his zone, and believe me, he will soon be hearing a voice so
lovely he won't believe it is from his own illusory incantations.

### Entry # 30
Date: Thu, 12 Dec 2013 10:26:32

My monochrome phone rang, and I picked it up. "Hey,"
said the woman on the other line. "Are you free right now?" It took me a
while to recognize the voice. It was, of course, Marian. Psych
grad at 25. Practitioner of an unhealthy lifestyle. Preacher of
poorly executed quips. That Marian.

"Yeah," I said.

Once, she was a cast in my midnight dream, but that was before the
wedding earlier this year. Had I been more receptive, I would have known
her discreet "suggestions" and would have gladly reciprocated her hints.
But marriage does bring out the woman in every girl; Marian knows better
than to gun every young man in the room with her pheromones. She is now
more dedicated to her husband, as she should be.

M and I talked for a while about this party she was inviting me in.
I did not like going to parties, but this was a choice not mine to make.

I dislike family gatherings, as they always end up in political
discussions that I am tired of hearing. Aunts and uncles throw back
and forth the same opinions that I have memorized, but I won't bother
you with the details. We are a mess, you must know that.

Bonifacio died
not because he was a part of the revolution, not because the enemies'
rifles peppered him with bullets. He died because it was an order of the
former leader. Do I think it was a betrayal of sorts? Here I was,
wondering about patriotism on a birthday party.

We are a mess, my kin and I, you must know that. We think deeply in the
dark moments of solitude, but in the wee hours of the morning, we weep
brat-like because we tend to soil our sheets with the crap coming out of
our boring mouths.

After drinking the equivalent of three bottles of beer, I wanted to
sleep off the rest of the night, that I might shut the people out of my
head finally.

Introductions again on the morrow, but not now. I need some snoozing.

It would be nice for me to find you elsewhere, perhaps in a more okay
place than this one. A wretched world where seven billion weirdlings
live never is a good rendezvous for two people, one of whom aspires to
be the ideal fling of the other. Outer Space wouldn't do as well.

The infinite quirks of our daily lives bore the heck of me. Get me out
of such languorous affairs, and let me see you already prepped up for
this simple occasion I am trying to pull you in.

The looks and the sounds and the feels of the people I have been
browsing emotionally tortures me.
The rumor is true: People are more
beautiful on the internet.
About their smarts, though---they vary from person to person.
What is the etiquette, then, when it comes to dealing
with these kinds of humans?
Whatever it is, I just have to make sure
that I am not to be so spooky to them. Ah---

Do not force it, they say. Do not. Do not, and all shall naturally,
smoothly follow.

An old hag I know is into fits of cough lately.
Her dear weak lungs now finally giving up on her.
I would advise her to take her vitamins soon.

An old hag is the wisest crook I know, and if she died in her sleep,
it would be a shame.

And the old hag needs some back rub,
but it's the middle of the night,
and she hates the mere sight of me.
It is not me whom she needs,
but her god.

And her god would talk to her in her dreams, asking her to stop smoking.
"Do it for them," he would say.
But she is such a stubborn woman that
even a divine deity as influential and popular as her god could not convince her.

It is astonishing to find something so repulsive to be so breathtakingly beautiful.
An amateur disease gone viral.
Hers was a daring shot to the skies of blaring cyber-fame.
The magic in her soul is hers to handle,
and for the world to leash.

Love is real.
An invincible arc passing between at least two contacts.
An idea agreed upon.
A painful abstraction of an empty stomach.
An ignorance that could not be vanquished.
A gimmick pulling back the strands of hair to a neat style.
A cheap perfume. A cheap mint.
Strings of used floss. Polished fingernails.
An affection for the outdated minds.
Love is real, but lovers are not.

Date: Wed, 18 Dec 2013

1.  Raindrops fell on hot roads. 
Heat from the deepest, most complex of sanatorium was exhumed to the surface.
Heavy clouds trap the vapors.
Everyone was getting agitated as the city melted beneath the sky.
It's physics.
2.  Shards shot out to random directions, away from the crime scene.
The vase had fallen to the floor, and I wondered why.
The shards were everywhere.
And what about the flowers?
It's unfortunate one could not simply reverse the path of every force of every particle that moved.
There is no Rewind Button;
this God did not make the events in the Universe to be reversible.
It's physics.
3.  I wasn't looking when you were talking to me.
Nothing in your speech is interesting.
Because it's about *meta*physics.

Talk about a lot of things.

Words came out of my mouth, slurry and very much undefined. I had no
good sound to produce, no good thought to mutter, and still I opted to
speak as if it were an obligation. I was told that random conversations
alleviate the pressure inside---a release, a black opening, a tiny hole
where the strangling gasesss would essscape, slithering all the way out.

The buzz I made was a lot, but the anguish in the guts remains. I might
be perpetually strangled.

Several minutes before midnight, all is burning. All is white with joy
and desire and illustrative rage; and the tremendous heat escaping from
the excited bodies make sudden changes.

Earth has been such a happy place where happy memories are shelved in
boundless rooms. And we have made it that way. Humans are a mass so
optimistic that the illusions of hellish ways of how the world would end
cannot consummate our prospects of having something divine.

The midnight is coming, or has come.
Or has gone.
No one knows for sure.
Time has been distorted by countless corrections and mistakes.
Either we are dying, or already we are dead.

I'm holding you sober. Your sobriety is a blessing, actually, like a
sneeze released violently after being held for so long. Thus, while my
presence is still vivid, I hold you not in solace but in a fiery
excitement. This is not a violation of privacy, not even a vile
stratagem I organized; rather, a celebration of two miscible personas
and the events that might follow.

Sometimes, I would look around, then see your face cranked and distorted
with stress; your nails empty of colors; hair badly done, wanting of
immediate care. I would want to extend a comforting arm, enlist you as
someone deserving of goodness in life that only I could hand out,
administer whatever assistance appropriate; and yet you remain
indefeasible and mighty, even in this blurry world, that I dare not go
near.

I'm holding you as an idol misplace in vain, as I would hold an
expensive wristwatch I can't afford. In reality, I cannot hold you, nor
can I ask you to kindly hike up the skirt and show me a flawed world no
longer knowledgeable of pampering.

Sometimes, I wish you could take a five-minute day-off (ha!) from your
skewed visions of screwed-up existence, but I have known the feeling for
so long I cannot help but set up a gig for you to immerse yourself in,
since I cannot convince you to see your life otherwise. It cannot be
silenced easily, I know. It cannot be shushed. I believe, though, that
one day, if you pulled and pushed the oars hard enough, you will
transcend from such a low point in your life, one way or another. Be
dear now, and don't do anything stupid.

I am a freelancer friend.
Everybody's nobody.
The bastard who is somehow successful of winning many a peer by staying neutral,
but is befriended truly by only a few.
I am the embodiment of a grapevine full of
backlashes, backstabbing secrets, and unfinished arguments. Containing
them all is like taming a bull: I can't. But I am a friend of this and a
friend of anti-this, and this is all I have. Good luck with that.

I am the messenger who died in the landmine field, and my lords and
ladies whose anguish I have failed to deliver to their respective
recipients would have desired for me another form of death; however, I
don't wish to inform them my failure, nor do I want a second shot at
retribution.

I am a freelancer friend, but if this did not make sense, it would work
out for me just fine.

I have witnessed how people silently accuse others for their amusement,
but have done nothing against it. I, too, am a perpetrator, and knowing
that that title doesn't offend me offends me. If this did not make
sense, then I know I am doing it right.

I am a freelancer friend, what a hectic job it is.

I am everyone's mailbox of undelivered hate, and if you would just
*please* bash my head with a baseball bat like what jocks do in shitty
movies for fun---

I don't mind goofing around with people who listen to drone tracks
for entertainment, because they're the ones who have interesting
thoughts to share.

I don't mind getting hexed by alpha dogs of my social circle. I've
done a lot of bad things,
and a little curse from them would only serve
as a reminder that I should be doing worse.

I don't mind being missed by some chubby lass who happens to be one of
the peers' leading darlings, even if she's just joking. I don't mind
because I don't believe her. She's just being nice. Sometimes, I would
like to think of myself as immune to such charms, but some charms
develop new kind of strains that pass through my defense system.

I don't mind not fitting anywhere with anyone, because no matter what I
do, there will still be empty slots for me to get in.

I don't mind being unable to patch this wanton bleeding with a remedial
touch, for there will be appropriate hands willing to do that. I'll just
have to hang on and look for them and hope it's not too late.

Date: Wed, 01 Jan 2014

Cousins plan to take me to the faraway hellhole.
I remember the environment as derisive,
making one learn a couple of things:

- Cigarette butts are as ubiquitous as the grey sand.
- Kids invade the beach at day while adults patiently wait for the night.
- Fatty meats are ironically must-haves when celebrating.
- Also alcohol and gambling.
- Forget not thy earplugs. Terrible singers populate the local karaoke hubs, letting loose of their anguish with their hard accents.
- Overlooking the sandy deposits of Matangbukay are lifeguard towers.
They all seem empty, though.
- Derived from the interiors of truck tires are plenty of lifebuoys
(which compensate for the scarcity of lifeguards).
- Everybody wears bikini in this place. Everybody.
- People are not at all loud and rowdy.
At least, that's what I have observed 500 meters away from them.
- To avoid sunburn, avoid the sun.
- Grill everything; die from colon cancer later.
- End your trip by catching a final glimpse of the setting sun.

The meandering eyes possess a certain sharpness that only
age or sickness could defeat. The meteoric pair sweeps
the scenery before relaying any acquired data to a decent brain.
However, they're altogether defamed with detestable comments that often
come from detestable figures, increasingly so that the evening has
become an impatient wait for the dawn.

### Entry # 45: *(i wrote once to a semi-imaginary fling. how stupid.)*
Date: Thu, 02 Jan 2014

In writing this do I realize that your prolonged absence simply cannot
be vanquished by smoke nor stupor. I appeal to you, thus, to redeem me
immediately from the miring transpiration of my existence. Be that
lucent reminder that at least one person is mad enough to console me,
that I am worth the distance from the punitive gags others throw at me.

In reciprocation, I will be at my best behavior.
By this, I mean to hush down my stupidities
and will not be much of a douche most modern persons are.
This will prevent your thoughts from being clouded with
wrong accusations and conclusions.

If, however, things would go out of control,
for such is Nature and all of its components,
from order dissipating to disorder,
then we must accept it.

(Strange for me to say these things about us parting already when we haven't even met yet.)

I must go now, stranger.
My bed invites me to DreamLand;
it shall wane a bit of my impatience,
and halt temporarily the effluvium of my tizzy thoughts of a faraway you.
Take care always.

We are isolated in an inaccessible isle of complexity quitters,
far from where the funerals of social behaviors are.
We have secrets that can astound earthworms and overlords alike
We are not honorifics nor bureaucracies,
but we are capable of vigorous copulation and funny possibilities.
We are so stupidly driven we think we can own our disgusting selves.
We are an asylum of dumb fucks in dusty trunks.
We are a multitude of tragedies.

My eyes now burn as the light effervescing from the monitor steal me away.
I am looking at all the highlights of the human race,
the darkness of the human travail,
every peak and every trough.
I am staring, too, at some faces, those declaring innocence.
Inanimate faces are the only innocent things one can look peacefully at nowadays;
and what a bad-luck-for-the-earth, for they cannot change the world.

Many a night had I perspired in my sleep, the stench would be heavy by
morning. I had to sun them thrice a week to eliminate the odor. But not
anymore. I shall suffer no longer from sweaty nights. Alas! here comes
the monsoon. It reveals the relief: a nourishing surge for the
nonexistent seeds sown in the soiled thoughts of all, delightfully that
it excites those who had grown tired of their dull vacation. A
transition of seasons when peculiar things are deemed okay: again will
bills drop to more affordable rates; wenches in corporal suits will now
be drenched whores in the storm; vehicles will soon float as chunks of
metal lilies on torrents of filth; bastards into sentimental poets. The
rest---they are kids again, and the sour smell from their fermented
armpits has gone.

### Entry # 49

There have always been clusters of authoritarian behaviors ruining
interpersonal relationships everywhere.
It focuses one's views on a central dogma---the person's
self. As a result of this dread,
imagination becomes the solution to those who are defeated by
the ruthless bossiness.
The key to their internally induced contentment
may lie on daydreaming that peace *has* a chance.
That peace does stand a chance in changing the heartless into philanthropist.

### Entry # 50: *four steps to senselessness and non-misanthropy*
Date: Sun, 05 Jan 2014 12:01:17

1.  Protection before insertion. Diminish as much damage as you can by
    initiating the verification of a thought or an idea before you try
    putting it in a debate with others. It doesn't have to be clean, but
    it must be cleansed.
1.  Allow usage of coins and undeviced dice for the sake of maintaining
    balance. The balance is to be kept horizontal. If it tilts, stop
    throwing up.
1.  Consider also ringing in your head the chances of diabloism. Does it
    divide or unite? Usually, I would suggest strongly the latter, but
    if yours is a non-canonical stance, it's your choice. Just don't
    expect them to hear you out.
1.  And in this mixology of brainiac profusion, I do not wish to astound
    the "elders" who have looked my way. I can offer nothing, not wisdom
    for I am inexperienced, not wits for I have been flunking, not even
    myself for I am nobody; but I could offer a fragment of personhood
    that you maybe familiar with, for I am a human nevertheless, doing
    robotic dance moves for a living.

The sight is flared up to maximum, and one can easily see the radiance
shooting up in geometric spirals. Every time I look, a small part of me
gets injured, as if it had been approved by the whole universe to be so
magnetizing yet detrimental. Such elegance prohibits me to witness its
passing. It's all theoretically acceptable, now that I think of it.

everyone---making homebound sentences to all directions and physically
cancelling themselves out, given that each statement is of equal
magnitude to the others they have made---is a nobody; and personally, it is
enticing as it is discombobulating.

"this is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an

They have spoken. I know now exactly the best thing to do. Fairness is a

The most inefficient guy in the bunch was heard chuckling over some
unfunny improv. The cunning in his smile was made not to be infectious.
He uploads what he cannot contain, mulls at what he could; and with this
strategy does he religiously follow himself around the glitchy planes.

I am startled by his need to branch out from the existing norms, and to
just create one that would fit his style. I wish to lend him a hand one
of these days.

### Entry # 55

I would like to oversleep some other time outside the house, in urban
caverns beneath cement bridges where slums never bother each other,
except only when asking for some little things. I would like to own
myself for a while.

People would be looking for me, but I would be flat on my stomach,
looking out far beyond the cities, watching the sun sink behind the
buildings, aching and smiling as if they would never know. They might
never hear from me again. I might go somewhere else where their warped
movement I would never hear of. And that would be my moment, in the
shadows, with fetid individuals who remain astonishingly optimistic
despite their ordeals.

I would be hungry most of the time, feel groggy and smell bad, but
that's part of the plan. Restoration never comes easily.

I don't see myself either ill-fated or privileged. I just hang in
here whenever I get the chance to just hang around a bit longer.
I could not help but notice how different people are;
and perhaps it is the right time to start expecting more instead of less,
to learn again the profits of breakage, to harness the prowess
and gather every last bit of
sickness and health.

Tried not to be hostile today.
It was difficult.
I've always thought that I'm one of the good guys,
and that most people have lost their grooves,
and that I should ignore their flickering noise.

Then, I remembered something my psychology teacher told me:
"Superiority complex is the worst kind of inferiority complex."
I realize now that it makes sense.

Yes, the wrong people can make the bad things come to life,
make them look better and cleaner.
They direct the waters from the drainage back to the treatment facility,
where all these fluids of all urban creatures are to be chemically infused with some drinkable liquid.
They are wrong in doing so.
But I was also wrong in putting myself several steps ahead of them,
when really, all this time that I have been in the field,
I cautiously look out for my steps, trying to figure out if I might be stepping on something hazardous that would shatter me to pieces,
while everyone is already crossing the finish
lines at the far side of the meadow.

I know this is a phantom exercise difficult to do, but doing it is kind of alleviating.
(I don't think alleviating is the proper term, but there goes.)

I would like to buy my own camera, but I am too impoverished to obtain a new one.
I must rely on my photographic memory for now.

I would like to buy me a new bike, so I can ride down the streets where children bathe and dance in the rain;
but I'm too broke, so I would have to stick to walking.

I would like to buy a new pair of shoes, but then I remembered that updating my wardrobe isn't my thing.
So, I gave up on the idea, wore my worn-out slippers, and walked outside.

I would like for the sun to shine just a little,
that there may be a glimpse of hope waiting behind the clouds.

### Entry # 59

I remember stepping into the room where our fiery fate had long been waiting.
Inside were common things.
We could have set ourselves ablaze had we been careless,
and "do you hear yourself?" was all that you'd muttered.
Did I answer that, or was I into your dilated eyes then that I was stupefied?
I don't remember.
Remind me of that sometime, do you mind?
Who would have thought that within these white walls we chanted
the same unintelligible syllables that only you and I must know?

### Entry # 60

The distant booming of a plane diverted my attention to the
stillness of everything. Apart from the late night lights,
outside was a dark aura that shines gloom over the land,
and a magic called sleep had once been conjured upon those who grew tired of
waiting for the night to fall. And to those who had been either immune
to the curse or too bewildered by the things that had transpired
recently to even dare to sleep, no matter how deviant and diminutive
they were, they're still up. They dug deeper into themselves, finding
who they were at the moment. Some transform, others go mad and wild in
flats without kitchens.

And I---I was here waiting for the hypnosis to
kiss me so that I might finally rest these eyes. Most people were no
longer awake as the curse tapped them. But know this: there was no awakening.
Morning would come again hours from now as it has always,
and the sun would rise still to put an end on the night's sorcery,
and they who had slept through the night would mechanically open their eyes for
themselves or for their families or for that work,
that school; *but* they would never be awake. They might have opened their
eyes, but they would never see again what once was. They would fail to
recognize---as it was in the past---the decaying things in front of
them. All those time they were awake, they really were asleep!

How will I face some new faces of Change, such as yours, if I am still
stuck at the image of your former self, a bright effigy of both
fluffiness and porcelain simplicity, now only a dissolved memorandum of
the past? Your worshipers have followed you still, despite dismembering
your own mane into some sort of a bobcat hairdo, which, I believe, is an
emblem of someone who's up to something worse than bad. Please, tell me
one day, if we must inevitably talk, that this is not the case. Forgive
me if, however, from now on, I'd be dodging your glances. I am not a fan
of your Change. I was never a fan of yours to begin with.

I don't mind you taking breaks from our conversations. I don't mind you
pressing another particle of soft powder on your face. I don't mind you

return to whatever job you paused just so you could mingle with me, I
won't mind, really.

I don't mind you not existing at all, imaginary friend. Please come

Spending time With myself again somewhere,
wondering if someday our old jokes would make us laugh again.
Our eyes, if they ever meet again, would gleam the same uncomfortable passion.

This world kills me, and I need you to redeem me from myself,
because sometimes, murders pollute the forests inside me.
Perhaps by taking a chance to talk to me about the simplest of things
would calm me down.

Fool me again with your whining, and that is fine,
that is, as long as you are patient enough to hear my forlorn desires.

You are the beacon present in my daydreaming pastime. A multidimensional
demigoddess of the morning light, present nowhere near me, yet
reachable, if only I wanted to fight traffic for at least two hours. But
even if I traveled that long, I wouldn't be sure if you would even look
my way. I look at the portraits stolen from the entanglement of codes of
your cryptic love blog, and I see me damned to the bones. From the
storms and debris I see you rise and fall, your chest doing the same.
Jet-black shines with great ember, even outshining my wits. I look, and
my eyes become deranged, my tongue blenched and smoked with the same
coyness you are invigorated with.

The people who have touched you in any way are social alphas, but I
cannot look up to them, because they wanted nothing but to hear you
grunt some dumb syllables. This I cannot change. I can, however, buy you
plastic flowers and inexpensive sweets. I can help you with your final
college paper, but only if you would offer to help me in mine after. I'm
being clever now, but that's because I am hoping that someday you would
let us be clever together.

Scum is sometimes needed to retain an insubstantial kind of masculinity.
It clings for a long time, the scum, even after many attempts of
reformation. And this process I truly detest, as I find it ridiculous
that manliness sometimes requires filth to be smothering the grin.

### Entry # 66: *the fury of sunny days and humid nights*
Date: Wed, 29 Jan 2014

I used to say, "I am not a clone of my former self. The past belongs
only to the past." That unalterable segment of existence which I would
soon, bit after bit, forget. What I was before can't be what I am now
nor what I will be. Ever since people (and things) around me began
changing at a different rate, my life has been a slow process of
stepping down to bedrock. Something in them possessed a great influence
that I can't overpower. Is it because I was born to be a prey? But I am
not. I look back at the months gone by, thinking what happened. Or
rather, what have I been doing.

...

My people get drunk with me whenever their schedules permit them. They
have this habit of opening me up. I am their patient on an operating
table. One would pick a scalpel and plunge the thing down somewhere in
my abdomen; the other would strangle a dark flesh, pick it up and say,
"People, this is the liver." What a sight: waterproof fluid squirting
everywhere. "This is *your* liver in escapism." There would be
red drops in our drinks. Bloody Mary. And then I would reckon flashes of
the former days, lashes always lashing. The world never has deceived me.
I have many places in me. I can show you that. But you must knock first.

...

There was a blank sheet of paper in front of me. I folded it into a
blank bullet and fired it skywards. You know what's absurd?
People who hold you in their hatred lungs, claiming that you have injured them with
accidental projectiles, which, if only they really checked out, was
their own un/doing. I had to think of something to jot down on it. But
you---I can't be breathed into doing something just because you exhaled
my direction. So, fill in the gap. Fate is only a funny valentine, an
incredulous affair written randomly in the stretch of space, not on
paper nor in mind.

the seconds go by, and not one sign of drowsiness is here. i am pulled
back to surface by the imaginings i had this morning, perhaps an
induction of the infernal core.

the first one was about my oral hygiene. in real life, i brush my teeth
and wash my mouth at least twice a day. but it was in this moment that a
cyst sprouted at the far right corner of my mouth. it felt
discomforting. i could not bring to a full close my jaws because of the
lump. without warning, the cyst detached itself from the gums (this
happened abruptly), and out it came. the thing fell right into my hands.
i tried squishing it a bit, seeing if it would burst into a bloody mess.
there was a bad taste in my mouth, like a yellowish spunk of infection.
a hint of iron.

the second dream came around quickly, picking up where the first left
off. it was a party of douches and dames, the bass indelible, and why I
was even there made me wonder. there were hookers dancing at one corner,
giggling at their own reflections. high school friends were there, too.
they looked sleek in their thrift-shop suits. one of the hooker was
strip-teasing, and I watched a bit before finally retiring to one of the
bedrooms, bored to death. i was searching for something in there,
something i no longer knew, but was interrupted when one of the girls
came in without knocking. everything faded.

the last of these dreams was about an odd contest. it includes some
bulky guys. i can't remember clearly now the mechanics of the game,
but the emerging victor was supposed to
have an "intimate intercourse" with the trophy girl. didn't remember how
it came to be, but--but the girl was motionless as stone. something bad
was bound to happen, and i felt it was my duty to intervene. i sat down
on the bed beside her. she motioned me to lie down next to her. when I
did, she yanked my arms, and only then did I notice that she a former
schoolmate. she was saying something, that she didn't want all others
prying over her body, how monstrous they behaved, how savage; that I was
her savior, her last debuff that would put an end to all this scam.
maybe she was right, but in order to prove her theory, her particles
should not have begun drifting away.

No time for preparation
I muffled my breathing for someone beneath the bed.
The person kept shifting as the metal hinges creaked around me.
Someone yelled in the distant roundabouts of the street.
The person's breathing, and the occasional murmuring, was more audible, though.
The air around me diffuses, and I would be choking soon.

Dreams show you an escape;
nightmares pin you down.
This was about the latter.
The moment of helplessness, when you must realize this is just a dream.
You hope you are smart enough to convince yourself to snap out of it,
but sometimes, the magic does not work.
It needs the latest patch, this *magic*,
and you wonder if it's already available on the App Store.

The person sensed a shuffling below. They stood up, metal hinges creaking noisily, and checked.
*She* was naked---this I duly
noticed---peering into my eyes.
A woman, twenty-plus-plus of age.
Had I given more interest in social sciences,
I could have easily figured out the constructs that baffled the pools she was whirling me in.
However, she did not mind seeing me there, a pollutant, a beg bud
(or bed bug) lying quietly, breathing heavily in this tight space.
She lay down on the wooden floor and rolled towards me under the bed.
We gazed long enough before finally closing our eyes and did what had to be done.
When I tried sliding my tongue into her mouth,
she gently pushed me off, smiled, and said,
"No, no tongue. Tongue is for pussies."

It was just a phase. And I was just fooling around when I said something
about a recent thought of inter-species prostitution, an idea I am now
alienating myself from after watching *District 9* for the third time.
That was a bit tough to stomach, I know; and no one, I think, could
digest the thought without feeling nauseous. But I was just fooling around. Just
being me, being funny.

I can be dark and shallow when agitated; more so when pushed to the
edge. What you did kind of forced me to the edge. You were being nasty.
The stuff coming out of your foul mouth was boiling like an ectoplasmic
substance. You were just ugly. I thought of landing several fists on
your face, but I couldn't. I just could not.

I see the curves and rolls, but none of them sticks to the heart.
I see Mt. Fuji in every one of them.
I look up and find it odd to say that none of them could really take me anywhere.
They suffer the consistency of fluctuation.
The movement of fashionistas impregnating their to-wear lists with high-end garments,
but I won't do anything about it.
It might have even occurred to me to begin to hate them and the way they gyrate at anything that juts up the trend,
but no, I won't do that.
Porcelain faces in horror movies have come out of the silver screen to haunt me during dawn.
They evaporate and condense; they disintegrate and materialize.
Stirrings are dragged down to the bottom by an unwanted enigma, and all
the sediments pile up. The accumulated weight is a force enough to
pressurize the amalgam into a hard slab. It is a mysterious event, if
you really want to know.

Hunger encroaches me as I leave my core crooning on empty rambles.
It wails like a cat, yearning, wanting comfort. But don't cats solve
problems by themselves? They stoop on hot solids for warmth; they make
themselves fit in narrow places for comfort. They are mathematicians,
geniuses of the hexagonal cliques, indifferent to the happenings below
and above them. So are my guts. My iron guts. My
expanding-then-contracting-then-expanding-again guts. My forlorn,
agitated, sweet, empty guts. My chemical guts. Well, if you wanted
honesty, that's all *I* had to say.

I admire the discretion you like to keep in your circle, but have your
eyes laid upon what's real? It's still out there. Compose all
you want, but it does not do away the hunger and thirst, the lack of
clothing.

Mark of proboscis left pinkish dots on my legs last night, and that's
nothing. When I was a youngster, I used to apply hydrogen peroxide on an
open wound I got from a roach bite, and the infected area would fizzle
like soda. Crummy! I used to chug down my old man's leftover drinks
because I wanted to maximize our water consumption. That, or I simply
wanted to prove something. Our lives were impeded by this kind of
living. It was not my choice, however. There was no nobility in it, as
you may have heard. Only instincts on loop.

If you were annoyed by the extreme impoliteness of those you have
touched with your keen sense of romance, then I don't get you or your
kin. Your story are written in books so few I bet they're treasure. I
will bring myself to this: you do *not* suck, oh perfected being.
Although it shouldn't be anyone's nature, I cannot blame them for
looking up to you with their sunglasses on. Again: you do not suck. Not
the slightest bit. You do, however, contain somewhere in your core the
need to obliterate. Golems will bow down before you. Totems will be
erected in your presence. But you will be the storm that doesn't give a
damn. For that, I will be secretly be battling against myself (again)
for such is athletics, and athletics means endurance.

Go back to the years of small talk, and you might just see what I have
seen in the eyes of many. I know the alleys at night are quite dark, but
the infection is real. Maybe an agua oxinada flashflood would come soon.

It was the musty atmosphere that makes those dots in the night sky
shimmer with a faint fluctuation, giving the illusion of wonder. Glitter
is fake, experts say. We wanted them to flicker, but that is not a
hottie hot sure shot. And when the nights no longer show us the stars,
we grow ignorant of so-and-so's such as how goes the process of
whatever. Meaningless, and all shall be forced to commit to their faith.

A hot gust of vapor draws abstract murals from dust particles on
decrepit vestiges. Invasive is the dust twister, momentous the amber, as
restless as I, submitting all to droop under the shades. I've been
waking early to long hours of stagnation, torn already and, come noon,
odorous of mixed sweat and cheap perfume. This is a way of life that's
supposed to be something good, but has gone otherwise. It would be
helpful, though, if a sort-of god would fall from somewhere and start
directing the flow of traffic---what goes where, which goes here. But no
astral transfiguration would ever occur, however dire the problems are.
For contingencies such as this, I must not resort into believing
nonexistent deities but must possess a sound mind, instead.

### Entry # 76

I always feel as though I've forgotten something. That much is
certain, though, that I've forgotten a great deal, but this nagging
feeling of forgotten priority or importance is always there---that
without remembering I stand to lose a great deal. So each moment
becomes a struggle to remember. Remembering is easy, though, for me
anyway. Or it once was, but it still seems to be. I choose to forget
now. I spent the bulk of my childhood remembering, without choice,
flowing into what I've become as an adult; if you forget, you're
forgotten: undependable, dead-weight, uncaring. It all comes down to
time---what we think about time---because remembering only matters in
the context of promptness, that you remember when the time is nigh.
Miss the moment and the remembering no longer matters, or not in the
same way anyway (like *l'esprit d'escalier*). Keeping deadlines,
delivering on demand, and giving people a reason to trust you with
themselves: this is what remembering consists in. And I choose to
forget. And that's inertia; that's death, the default setting we'll
turn back to in the end. But writing is remembering, and, on some
basic level, I think thought is too. So for now I'll sleep, forget all
this, and you will too. Maybe I've forgotten that it's okay to forget,
but I'm sure I'll forget that too, once it's time to remember again.

The busiest parts of the city are the dirtiest. The playground of imps.
Vehicles bucking on bumpers upon bumpers; and drivers are not so
different. Everyone's strategy: cut into line, be ahead.
The smog causes a dull buzz below the folds of the forehead. I walked
on calloused roads with a smile in my head. It seemed to be a good fuel
for the core. On long and tiring treks along pavements with marred and
tainted dimwits, if one must pursue one, I suggest keeping a slip of
happy in the chink of the mind. Works wonders.

I don't mind playing with people who listen drone tracks on
YouTube for entertainment, because they're the ones who have interesting
thoughts to share.

I don't mind alpha beings of my social circle hexing me. I have
done a lot of bad things, and a little curse from them would only serve
as a reminder that I should do worse.

I don't mind being missed by some chubby lass who happens to be one of
the peers' leading darlings, even if she's just joking. I don't mind
because I don't believe her. She's just being nice. Sometimes, I would
like to think of myself as immune to such charms, but some charms
develop new kind of strains that pass through my defense system.

I don't mind not fitting anywhere with anyone, because no matter what I
do, there will still be empty slots for me to get in.

I don't mind being unable to patch this wanton bleeding with a remedial
touch, for there will be appropriate hands willing to do that. I'll just
have to hang on and look for them and hope it's not too late.

If you would tell me I am different, I would have to respond with the
most improper inquiry, thus: Am I *differently* different, or am I

the things i would say to my kindergarten-self are definitive on their
own. it's just that, this boy was past his time that he couldn't even look
after his own or smell his morning breath. he would brush his teeth. he
would smell of his parents' cologne, because to his senses,
they reminded him of people who loved his every cell. he could
tie his own shoelaces, and now look at him, tall enough to see what's
over the fence.

i am him. or more appropriately, i *was* him. to be honest, i white-lied
when i/he said a paragraph ago that his idiocy in the vastness of the
cosmic plane was noticeable, but such was not always the case. there
were holes in him which were passed down as a genetic malnutrition to a
much younger sibling, and had he been eager to fill them with something,
he would have been a hole himself. but he is me now. and i am getting
there, stronger daily, more unpredictable than my kindergarten-self.

And when something real cannot happen to people with glossy, fragile
skins, or the natural flow of things does not provide them what they
need or want, I have some explaining to do.

People, including you and me, embalm their selves with the platitudes of
comfort and lies, their disappointed when reality overpowers
expectations. It's always a nasty feeling. Do not force a lid onto a
boiling pot of stew.

However they defy their insides, it will always be too repulsive, and
instinctively, they will groan in disbelief. If they would find
themselves more miserable than before,
it could be that theirclothes don't fit anymore,
and they who have endured the
discomfort just to invigorate minds will no longer be known to the true
ways of the world.

So cold a gaze chilled the feet and quashed the appeals to move. What
freaky look this villain must have, impertinently so that it degraded
the chap to a decrepit slab of dung. It provoked the heart of the
panic-stricken victim to violent convulsions. The chap sought for warmth
in him that might thaw his frozen figure, but none of it was found.
Nothing but the peculiar sense of disability, as if the legs were stiff

Snitches and their knack for uttering in cursed tongue the strangest of
their gigs and affairs just to baffle those---maybe us---who are molded to
live only in normalcy or less. This is evident everywhere I turn my head
to, more so their ineffective disguise of their own tedious statures
jeweled only so as to steer the optical inferences from the truth.

I have tried to mingle with these porcelain-skinned hippos, observe
their mannerisms from a fence, and---and this is for the future
seedlings, so listen up---none of which are astonishing. I can get
more hype from staring at a full moon. That shit gets me hanging all the
time, not these bipeds. I will not be forcing an attempt sojourning
about their living fantastic lives as such a thing is plain stupid and

nobility. Plus, I can enjoy my own corner, with or without a

Sweat was smelly underneath the clothes. Indeed, it was a race against
the self, against his tigers that had lain dormant and have now trembled
awake---the tormentors versus the tormented. He perished in discomfort.
Knowing that his body had become the adversary did not help. Giving up
was not an option, though. He dragged on continuously, careful not to
lose concentration. With determination, he was convinced that this
stupid skirmish was his to win. Vengeance and its squalor would be
swift. The beasts must no longer clutch him by his entrails, and in its
spot, belch subsiding, solace would emerge.

You are an entity I hear as the headphones speak to me in lyrical glum,
you who have taken residence in the smug of a mind. I feel you as
glowing lamp or a growing lump homing for the core.

Too, I feel dispirited knowing your nearness is as far as you are, but
the distance does not always matter, especially when things involved are
beyond logical entanglement and scientific method. My eyes can only
discern objects up to about 10 kilometers, yet the syntax of the
physical stretch is making me sketch on the eyes. This itch requires
them to be drugged with special milk drops as the lactose in them is
rumored to reduce the redness of the sclera, although---who am I
kidding?

The mourning is over. The bills now pile up, and you have left the spot.
However, as long as memories remain mine, I'll seek more of you in my
clammy head, and less of the hopes that are stolen from me by the real
icon of you here in my computer, and by fate.

The last of the chills crept up the last strings caught in the cobweb of
a hair bundle. I am cold again; I thought the last phase of cold winds
has gone down the enema meteoron, but it seems to have returned,
checking on us if we have sunken enough to the lowest of our low. I am
cold, but I don't need anyone sharing my cot. It is small and narrow,
and I don't like sharing it with another human being. Besides, there is
always that option of peering down deep into myself, back to the past,
and it is proven to be more effective in keeping together the internal
heat than to have some warm flesh next to mine.

the hardest part of finding myself in my own dream was, my ability
to bend morphean gases was muted. in the arms of myself, i wailed in
fright as i tried to outrun whatever it was that was after me. imagine
me sprinting on a nether architectural abandoned ruins whilst hugging
myself. i was a straitjacket away from being a hospital fugitive, and
maybe the addition of such could have explained it better. it did not
match any interpretations, and so it must have surpassed anyone's
knowledge; however, i cannot be certain of this. and that, kids, was

I see you evolve every time I visit you here. I see you grow, as time
passes, more refreshing, the blur stuffier. The friendly aura is
understandable, but friends in any form or shape in this region are made
up of surges and of subconsciousness.

This is a giveaway: your soul rests upon the blinding neon lights, but I
don't believe in the existence of souls. They're just one of those terms
people use as an excuse to be hyperbolic about whoever is no longer in
the physical here. Whatever happiness or sadness or weariness you
consume consumes me as well. We are here, and it is in this isolation we
are linked.

Any temperament is the result of the pushing and pulling of my
imagination until it is almost imperfect. The flaws make you a better
person than who you were the last time I was here.

nothingness is not really the conventional idea concerning the lack of

Forward again through the slosh of nosy people who have always been
imprudent when they step on feet unknown. Watch their faces smirk as you
frown upon them. They never apologize, at least not with words. They
just cock their heads slightly forward, a palm up. *Idiots*.
Nevertheless, I could pass this as a reasonable excuse. Nowhere is safe.
A fact.

This is a daily routine to and from school. That inevitable commutation
from point A to point B. I study people from a distance carefully. I
could earn a degree called Bachelor of Science in Sociopathological
Polyphasing---whatever that means. My hands on my pockets, sometimes
always, sometimes never. There's no such thing as being too alert. It
isn't comfortable anywhere near these people, in this kind of density.

Fellow commuters do the same. They get lost. Lean on a dry wall, their
hopes fleshing out their glimpses until they bleed out their entire
sprites. In a place like this, I've always assumed a defensive tactic of
not giving a whole bunch of heck to strangers. It seems to work. I seem

I will tell you any of the jukebox jokes I heard from a recent elevator
ride, but it is too foggy today, despite the climate, despite the
counterclockwise rotation of an ethereal axis, to be telling local puns
to someone who has no basic interest invested in me. I recall your
fondness for stupidity-masked garbage-can comedians (which explains why
you like oscar the grouch), but I am more of a cynical ass-hat rather
than the funny guy you knew from years back.

"You are the love of my life," said no one, not even me. "---but i will
let you know every now and then that a good laugh makes it somehow a bit
bearable." It is a good point. I like how it is pungent on my tongue,
the way it clicks.

Every time I make my way down the staircase, the spirits of the past
keep pulling me back up to the first step. they know it will be hard all
over again.

(At the back, somebody is secretly paying attention to my maneuvers, but
he's just a furry douche. He is bound to be like that. He will end up
puking by the sewers one day and he will rejoice on ten meals a week. No
one actually minds him; that is, in the conventional sense of
mindfulness. He too is full of jokes. From birth until he gives his
entire existence to this branch of the hyperspace. You will like him
when you meet him.)

extensively stretched to induce a hard drive malfunction. however, there
is no hard drive; only a squishy organ of neurons lodged in its own
cranial asylum, always on the brink of lacunar amnesia. the ability of
how a person can remember to wait varies solely on the song being played
on that blasted stereo. no song at all means impatience exponentially
growing, invariably.

this has been too long a wait for precipitation, too tiring an amble
across the asphalt desert in search for an oasis. the batt on my phone

Saved hopes are the very atoms of a place in full oscillation, working

limbs for bliss.

Gone were the days that made me so proud about this place. Gone was its
magnificence. The city swells; in it are torn people wanting to survive
and to occasionally live. At even rarer instances, to laugh. It swells
past harmonics, past all this noise, this wasteful waves of losses until
it can no longer contain the blankness that would soon embalm every
corner as soon as it ceases to pursue living.

illuminated with gunfire, and everyone fell down. i did not know how
many were dead, but i was alive. when the spraying of bullets was over,

To let the joules die down even amid this season is pragmatic, but to
what extent is it considered to be sane still? I get the occasional
desire of diving in a pool of water. The reason behind this may have
something to do with heat being related to fire, and fire being quenched
by water, thinking that by diving into the blues will somehow lower our
body temperature. However, this concept is only true in some cases. Not
all the time does water extinguish fire, or in this case, body heat; is
the water in the form of steam? Is it boiling? Is the water a hard block
of polar ice? Think about it.

nightmarish distresses have me by the neck as each sends me to hysteria.
blood gushes to throat, vehemently throbbing. i am left immobile and
paralyzed, vulnerable to my own mind's freak shows. here are the latest
ones:

- A man in his suit named Lou stood sweating in front me.
From his pocket, he drew what seemed like a dagger and quickly plunged the
tool deep into his chest. He gurgled, wriggled, and died. Moreover,
that he was in a suit and named Lou could be the closest I can be of
getting Litt up.
- VIP pass to a photoshoot of a famous fashion magazine. Semi-nude
models sprung out of the wardrobe and into the set. Their eyes were
as wide as their grins.
- I poured hot water in a porcelain cup before thinking that "the heat
is stupid." I let the cup be fully heated before I poured out the
hot water. Then, I poured in ice cold water. The abrupt change in
temperature caused the cup to crack, crumble, and shatter in my

In the passing of time, I have read several articles about the truces
between the upper and lower layers of forgetfulness, and how each fold
is affecting the ones adjacent to it. But if I should re-type from
memory the first two sentences of each article, I could be wrong.
Memories are often misleading, and everyone knows that.

Sometimes I listen to music to help me remember what I should have
forgotten, a note assigned to each ego I have shed, one beat for every
tooth I have misplaced. There are questions, too, that are triggered by
some tracks, and usually, the answers to those are something about
learning (or choosing not to) from the sections we divide to belong on
the left side of spacetime line. As we skim the past, we will see traces
of sound waves that bring out the melodies we long to disinfect but
somehow cannot. Makes me wonder: Why bother re-tracking what is or are
not anymore?

faction of the self to set out on a trek away from the living
standardized by the norms of the environs. 
only a philosophy founded on empirical accounts could have supported this
belief.

"it might work," one would say. (*what might work?*
the crowd would ask. this time, however, one no longer pays
attention to the whims of many.) and to believe it to be the road to
recovery is one thing; it is another for it to actually work. if and
when asked, one would openly admit that without professional assistance,
the outcomes are blurry at best. if done right, it could act as a
placebo; otherwise, a paraplegia of sorts. it really depends, this
figure now thinks, on the setting of the journey and, ultimately, the
destination.

i took off, leaving a few sweetened nothings to those who saw me on
my way out, but there were busy spirits upstairs so absorbed in other
things that i did not mind saying goodbye to them. i thought it was
cool, disappearing like that, but it isn't. it was me breaking my own
fingers, thinking the spasms would go unnoticed; immature and unclean.

the 'spirits', via text, told me, "we didn't know you already left.
say goodbye next time, will you? haha. take care."

the message was so
striking i cannot help but feel sorry for myself.
again, my actions have
let down the important people in my life.

small regrets do add up to form an indelible one.
futureSelf, if you're reading this, don't do it again.

the point of buying movie tickets is to have the best place in the
theater, and in my opinion, that would be four to six rows from the first.
apparently, many still prefer to watch from the balcony, the point of
which i don't understand. isn't it the same as watching at home on a
42" tv? if i were to spend my money on cinema, i'd make
the most out of it by placing myself where the magic happens.

however, i didn't want to argue with the couple who dragged me to go
and watch the latest installment about mutants.
after all, my ticket came from their money;
and any intolerable situation that comes with good freebies i can
purge later over the net. call it whining or complaining, whatever
poisons your heart.

due to much contemplation, one eventually becomes wrought to the point
where the skin hugs tightly the flesh. it grips around the neck and
fatally damages the trachea. before submitting to the void, one expends
the last calorie on one final thought: this is just a drill, and the
sooner i comply, the better.

The hot eastern breeze brings me again the smell of the dying spirit of
a man who, at his drifting moments, prefers to be drunk than to be
sober. He sends absurd messages about the value of family and friends,
and the need to glorify a supreme being. Is this the manifestation of
his ancient doings, to be a sorry figure he inflicted upon himself long
ago, a silhouette among the sunny crowd that demands only pity because
he can no longer afford one for himself?

We throw first the ball far out the verdant field, hoping a loyal friend
would get it for us. But that isn't how loyalty is determined. And so,
having finally noticed that the ball is there and we are here, and no
one else would retrieve it for us, we ourselves fetch what we have
thrown. We are our own dogs, leashed, illogical. Why are we even willing
to do even simple things for a greater authority? And, isn't this
greater authority our own selves? We did not realize that early on. Too
dumb, actually, to have thrown something away in the first place that we
would want or need right away.

This old man had thrown away his one life, and now, it's almost too late
to think things over, especially that his mind smells foggy with brandy.

She sends an e-mail to her latest lover every time something important
comes up. She is with us, but her mind is across time zones, the globe
she spins as her own, wondering what he has bee doing. Is he eating junk
food? Is he himself a piece of junk? Will he be sharing bread to help us
out here in this tropical place? Her eyes dance to the bits of waiting,
but can only be so patient. She waits for him to go online every night,
and when he does, they would spend hours chatting about the things they
already know. Hours of canned convo on loop. Why? Because people are
dying to hear something familiar again.

Everything is quickly becoming foreign to everyone. Even the space is
altered constantly to blur tick after tick the visions of moments ago.
Details are microscopic as observed from a perspective. Despite this,
the world still feels the same, the grand blanket not threatened. Too
many earthly heartaches, afraid of the known and unknown and all those
in the un-categorized synapses.

She looked beautiful yesterday, but an hour ago, she decayed a bit. So
he must be updated, lest he recognizes this person of his interest no
more.

The gaps themselves serve as tips on how to quantify the seemingly
immeasurable stretch between two points. The tension does us a
disservice and at the same time connects us at some caring level: a
pull-here push-there mechanism we barely can integrate into our senses.
Start convincing ourselves to put aside these variances, and instead,
begin to nurture the remaining similarities, minute though they may be;
here commences the series of stimulation where respect for the other
becomes more pronounced through actions, growing little by little. The
liking of personalities comes afterwards, being able to forget to look
down on our altered views of living, finally agreeing at something
compassionate or unique or otherworldly. --*No*, we will not admit that
there is something more to this flimflam, but soon enough, we will lock
ourselves in distressing passion, and whatnot.

Do some bad things for your own detox, but ultimately, you should not be
so cruel to yourself. The frailty that is your own dumbness can subject
you to hazards, but this does not always permit you to search for your
things in the wrong places. In the mornings when the sun is hiding
behind the vapors, have an apple or a banana or a coffee, or any other
ABC's, because your purpose for yourself is to be in mint condition.
most of the time, it is Monday. Do not look for your undergarments in
the wrong pile of clothes. Have you forgotten where you placed them? Too
bad. Somebody might have already bleached your granny boxers for you, in
which case, set the said pile ablaze and seek solace from the warmth of
its fire.

i rattled the crisp carcass on my head along with me not only because i
needed it to confirm how dubious strangers can get (and i was right--two
individuals gazed at me in a bad way), but also it doubles as an
adorable protection from the sun (but i was wrong--my scalp almost
burned). a bird can perch in the nest of my hair, and i would not mind.
anyway, there was i walking towards a skinny buddy familiar only to keen
senses, for after all these months that i have not seen him, he has not
gained weight nor another strand of hair. he told me that not much has
changed since last we met: him, slim and peculiar; i, outstanding only
in implosion.

we both complained about the thinning of the ozone.
you see, in many ways we are similar. we grumble at anything of minute
importance, from the dots of our being to the relevance of government,
ans such and such. i was about to tell him this discernment, but when i
looked over my shoulder, the guy was gone.

the afternoon was deadly, nothing unusual. anything can disappear
and anyone with asthma would want to disappear. i moved on.

i went back to the old apartment, and therein stood a lovely parent
waiting for me. she seemed more organic now. buddy and hogan[^b-and-h] have been moved out.
our refrigerator was gone. most of the objects that we had
were no longer there. she sold so many things. the living room was the
only sentiment of this abode's previous splendor left, and even in that
moment, it echoed the chills of the occupants who once had been screwing
their lives there. "where is everybody?" i asked my mother. she did not
speak. maybe she was disappointed, too. this rest house, this anthill,
no more.

[^b-and-h]: Run free and wild, Buddy and Hogan, wherever you are.

I will fail to distinguish the abilities of devices, if any, modern or

me the will to make the first step, primarily due to the conflict with

any promises of coming up with an epistolary compilation plummeted to
naught when the receiving party, on thorough dissection of the contents
of the mail, chose not to reply. the sending party might have penned
something barely inducing a response, but how could they know? they are
not the smartest guild in this damned rut. their hearts convulse at
small inconveniences, their brains short out. fools!--they had to bother
the mailman for many months just to realize nothing was coming their
way.

it is all in the past now, and everybody changes places at some point in
life, builds new forts, or adapts into a new circle of unfriendly
neighborhood. the return address on that mail does not belong to anybody
anymore. and the mailman, now happier, has been untouched since.

a scene where i was running away from a man with a gun recurred. every
time i looked back, he could not be seen because it was too dark in this
long alley. when i looked down, my legs were running on concrete
treadmill. i kept running, but didn't move. i yelled at him to stay
back, but he just gave off a sinister chuckle, the only sign of his

I could hardly make out the figures of stoichiometry chalked on the
board, or hear from the soft droning the instructor's purr. There was no
dullness in any chemistry class I have been, until that moment, when in
a blink I found myself---quite instantaneously, as if bypassing the
physical laws of nature---lying on a bed. In that moment of my
teleportation, came in the room a girl of familiar shape. We used to
hang out together. We played with flames, but along the way an
obstruction was formed. It all just did not feel right anymore. Funny
how small things can make big differences. The flames were extinguished,
and it was all queasiness from there.

Anyway, she came in the room and feigned surprise. I was *not* in my
bedroom. But her walking in was graceful and felt natural, like I had
predicted her going in the room and likewise, she was expecting to see
me there, and that my being unexpectedly there was something easily
thrown out of the picture. We made out on the bed, which felt good. And
remembering *this whole dream* I had still makes me feel good, but not
in the way you are probably thinking right now.

**Scene 1**: It is tough to look at the songbook for a number for the jays to sing.
Your lungs don't hold as much air as you'd like. They go out when
the crowd doesn't have a clue on what you're on to, if you really
were in sync with the karaoke. On the plus side, your voice sucks.
Another party blending, human tapestries to shy away from. It is
altogether different in the rural villages. The audience there are
more tolerable.

**Scene 2**: A housemate dragged me in front of his girl to celebrate a two-decade
defeat. My eyes hardly peeled themselves as he prompted me to a glass
stall of many a love song.

**Scene 3**: Gut me not as I down my last meal in zero expertise. It feels good to
know that such food is possible in a lewd setting. I have always
thought of KTV bars as establishments erected solely for old timers
willing to empty their wallets in exchange for a quick relief. I was
wrong. Good grub, bad choice. Good drag, bad voice.

**Scene 4**: Two tables actively participated in a garbling chorale during the
happy hour. Tough battle.

when an earthquake of low magnitude shakes the
place and is felt by the millions of strangers prancing on afternoon
streets, go directly to the nearest wifi hotspot, ideally a coffee shop,
and hop online. but don't you just post a mindless "did you just feel
that earthquake?" status to direct the local netizens' attention to the
obvious. do not cheat nor settle for this mediocre chore. you, as a
trickster of various complex trades, are better than that.

instead, say:
"i witnessed something that trembled me to my knees. i was on the
twelfth floor when the ground beneath the cars of the street across this
building convulsed and split, and from the fissure, at least four iron
tendrils, each as long as a ten-wheeler, came out and started striking
and crushing all the moving objects nearby. every businessmen sprinted
off from the chaos; the hipsters held up their smartphones (run, you
bastards!); the lovers accepted their fate. when the ground quaked
again, the cleft grew wider, eating the street up (and all on it) until
the sidewalks became the dried lips of a gaping mouth. from this
opening, an abysmal cyber-cuttlefish slowly rose. as i type this, the
fins just passed by my window. why do i feel leaden? i'm afraid this
city will be baptized very, very soon."

1.  in pulling down the lever that opens the louvre, the light reveals
    unto thee the crisis of spatial contingency located in the gap
    between two households. this gap is an outside basement of ancient
    debris, an ecosystem for stray cats and other non-mammalian pests
    that, come dusk, bug you with eerie messages. this is your view when
    you get up late in the morning, when you recover again from the
    previous hours what you claimed you'd  have forgotten by daylight.
    reminder: push back up the louvre lever during bad weather,
    because there is a rain drain pipe about a meter away of which end
    opening conveniently faces your window. on stormy days, your view is
    niagara falls.
2.  what kind of room is this? a sliding door with a hook-and-eye lock?
    even the hounds can topple it.
3.  speaking of hounds, there are two of them of the same muscular
    build. the younger one frequently sprites on furniture and footwear
    and the trash bin, and leaves a mess when he's left unchecked. if
    caught doing misdeeds, i beg you, do not grab the broom stick and
    whack him like a golf ball. you imbecile, you irresponsible dog
    owner. teach him manners without using fear and violence. be cesar
    millan. besides, golf sucks. and golf courses waste acres of space.
4.  the only credit i can give to the entirety of golf is in the
    engineering that lies on the ball itself. its pioneers were smart to
    design onto its surface a tessellation (of sorts) of dimples that
    would make it fly efficiently in terms of aerodynamics.
5.  one more time, i froze in an un-cool way, the way in which i put a
    palm over my mouth, and my pupils dilate. it is hard to regain from
    a shocking incident. i shall narrate briefly about it, nonetheless:
    my cousin and i were eating our dinner together, talking about the
    richest drummers---because david grohl was on tv at the moment---when
    from midair and onto our food landed a rogue cockroach. it
    strolled over our dinner, and my pal started cursing at it,
    profusely so. the villain was uninterested in humanspeak. cousin
    spooned it out and placed it atop the table, still near the food,
    and stood up to get the insect spray. like i told you, the whole
    time i froze in an un-cool way, not because i feel icky around
    roaches, no. it was this bold move, to not give a damn about humans
    having their dinner, that insulted me speechless. BAH---the memory
    is fresh: the soft buzz of the wings, its hideous presence, its
    indifference. i know it's over.

Stooped on a seat and quiet was the only friend. Your drink was rattling
on the table turning sour. It was a cough of coffee from somewhere,
another item on my list of odd offerings from myself to myself---the
strangest one, by the way, is a sleeping pill. It's funny because it's
an antidepressant that opposes the main function of caffeine, and could
someone be held responsible if these were inaccurate? Yet, I would
rather gulp petroleum. I mean, I would *never* drink fossil fuel,
because that would be crude. My mother used to bring home Arabian
beverages, but none of them could restore the lost youthful vigor. 

My veins at the side of my head feel like vines creeping up a steeple of
nowhere-land, green whips lashing all at once a crack. 

And when Time slowly ripened---the boy ageing to a man, passed from one
to somebody's meager hands---the Life, if it were one, was
threatened, when the last option was to choke the limbered existence
with a fade from the changing smoke.

the flesh had avoided mingling, and now, it longed for warmth. i
strolled down the grime network of alleys and streets. at night in some
corners, an armed man waits for his next victim. one could die for the
simplest yet stupidest reasons. good thing i did not fancy the night
mistress that time nor did her darklings paid me visit. i did stroll at
daytime, safe and away from curs; and went out and met the disorder
pleasantly. i exist *here and now*, that means i took the *right* turn
homeward and slept through nocturia. 

some say the way to a thug's heart is to fiddle first through their
fatty liver and then their blackened lungs. others prefer the benign
processes of social merry-making in which only money talks. but since i
did not inherit the gambling traits of my father, this suggests that i
take the liver-lung option, unless there is a third, more viable
option: why bother myself of the disdain among choices, when not
choosing may be just as valid?

When you look at your watch, you perceive the duration of your stay. It
is alluring in itself: its hands beckoning your eyes to look at it again
when just ten seconds ago, you checked the time. Unless your reality
twists on itself in a loop, ten-second moment does not change much.

Alas, you have no watch, yet you imagined yourself wearing one. That
feeling when a concept materializes because (y)our mind can be, at some
instances, playful; when you are humming a tune and suddenly the radio is
playing it; or when the door reveals what's on the other side but you
already know what or what not to expect. This is the time you feign the
awe, and since no one will do it for you, might as well rediscover your
type of entertainment.

So look inward, and tell me what's in the stall. Do you see magazines
filed in a rack? Now, don't let your hands rearrange them in an order---usually,
the most informative ones in the front, fashion mags at the
back. No one cares about your pick nor your priorities. Or, do you see
your favorite electronic apparatuses? (Again, don't.) Do you see plates
of food? (Surely, you won't.) Is this your enjoyment? Would you like to
grab one for yourself? Do you buy your happiness? If, instead, you see
abstract objects---colorful and always psychedelic---it's because you
haven't been in extravagant shopping centers.

Everything might have seemed illustrious at one point in your life, but
I think it was a part of a long-ago blindness, when your status was
still surrounded in debris, and you and your friends played in front of
the rich man's gates because that was all this penury could offer.

i had a dream---in fact a series of dreams, but i can't remember all of
them except for this one. i was taking out a smelly trash when the
plastic bag broke at the bottom due to much weight, and all the rubbish
and garbage juice splattered on the ground. i picked them one by one and
put them back in the bag, which just slipped right out of the hole. this
went on for minutes, until i felt a squirming sensation in my mouth, as
if to snap me out of my focus. i spat on the ground. it was all saliva,
blood, and maggots. i spat some more, because the squirming would not
stop. still, blood and maggots. horrifying.

### Entry # 138: *afternoon ale-ment*
Date: Tue, 22 Jul 2014

a guitar man once told me that people find creative ways to authenticate
their unhappiness. i thought to myself, "do they also generate their
own festering?" 

i attempt this now, because my self as usual belongs to a different
place and time, the self that waxes some fake wings onto his back to fly
above the cityscape just to have a talk with you---

would you swear to tell me next time we meet on that alternative setting
the consequences of ignorance regarding the science of jesters
conscripting their fellow jokers under depressive fumes? humor seeks to
temper the blemished cheeks. yours, though, as i remember it, is beyond
despair. the way people snap their necks to your way just to claim your
cheekiness for their own, even for a while. or the way they applaud at
you every time you share a laugh. they are selfish. they only want to
have *your* fun for *them*selves. and by 'they', i mean 'we'. by 'we',
'i'.

and if i may, i want to tell you some things. don't worry, though. the
sun is high and the wax melts on my back. i am dizzy from keeping my
composure here mid-air. the harder i fight the fall, the dizzier it
gets. i'm not sure you can condone this, but this will be over soon. i
will tell you this in the most non-poetic method i can, as poets are
often misunderstood, and i don't want to be it that way.

...periodically, i wear jackets of different thickness to fend off the
cold that is never here. remember, the sun is high on my back. i can't
even imagine what winter feels like or what six sol-less months must be
on the skin, as i have lived my entire life in a tropical metropolis.
yet, whenever it is unusually chilling and/or i just feel fashionable, i
wear jackets.

why jackets? why of different thickness? (i ask questions i want to
answer myself. read on to not know why.)

the phantoms---phantoms being strangers enlisted under 'painfully
wonderful'---avoid making themselves visible, but when i spot one, i
acknowledge them with all the disease in my heart. i shiver. i steal
from my courage, and look. my hopes, on the other hand, strive not too
hard in the labyrinthine craft of the virginal, semi-acoustic,
like-minded imaginings of art and clarity of cloisters found both inside
and out of my pad. i need to have a third set of skin to protect me.
like the glossy veil that hugs a hardbound's cardboard shell. a cover to
cover the cover, you might say.

as long as the thought of any self-rubbing, self-squeezing celestia i
have down under my clothes, there would be no problem. as long as you
find the idea of it appropriate for you to hold, then i shall, with
all of my calories, stand ever so firmly with this your notion,
even if it directs me to my perdition.

immortality is a cheat index to fulfill a lifelong death wish. you do
recall, don't you? it is also the wax that holds together my
'flappiness' that is almost gone now, and yet here i am, asserting the
point still. you do recall, don't you? well, *i don't*, but it doesn't
mean it's not true in many cases.

*in any case*, i know this afternoon is spent yet again in trance, the
prismatic heavens dancing along my breadth, but i enjoyed it since i
have you to guide me safely into a landing spot as my wings finally
detach themselves off of my spine.

### Entry # 139: *mortals and pestles*
Date: Thu, 24 Jul 2014

Shortly after an earthquake dream, I wriggled out of the blanket into
the world downsized from its colossal stature.

Inside dreamland, everything is blown up out of scale, and the dreamer
will have to resort to other forms of traveling. Once, I summoned a
firetruck and boarded it. I escaped a traffic jam but was later flagged
down by a traffic enforcer. What said he? He scribbled on some
ticket-pad as I reasoned my way out of this mess. "But Officer, this
must be a dream?"

I resumed much later my choking seizures, because that is how I deal
with the contingencies of my itchy closet life.

Mortality, if anything, is a bitter potion I have been drinking from the
fountain of my grandma's garden. It helped me flush down the lipids that
were passed to me down by her black sheep offspring through genetics,
which were then stuffed in my atria at the dawn of my existence. I don't
know what to make of that, but it was boiling in me. That was a long
while ago, though, at least several hundred honeymoons into the past.

And if the ground shakes again the next time I lose consciousness? Or is
the inversion of this that I must be aware of?

Everybody would shift from side to side, their pelvic bones gyrating
without me, retracing lost steps on grand parquet still without me. I
would have to dance alone to safety. However, this is nothing new to me---a task from my routine, it simply is.

I don't like how this is gradually becoming a burden when I really think
it isn't, and I can't be certain anymore whether meteors are worth the
synthetic stigma of aspiring spacepeople. Or of astrologers who think of
them as the trails of omen.

The collected horns of traffic rising up to the challenge went on
tirelessly. Another day to get by. I knew that I must look in every
direction before crossing the street. At one moment, a truck étude blew me
off as if to say "Speed up!"
The driver did not wave a hand when I looked up at him through the windshield,
but, in a raspy yell, said some bad things. This must be the workings of
having to wake up early in the morning, groggy still and breakfast-less,
to deliver big things big people buy, in order to live by until the next
paycheck. I forgave him for being crass and out of mechanical
practicality. I could have flipped him the bird, but that would not have
taken the both of us anywhere. 

As I walked on, I saw a tramp waving at me. He is fat and ugly and
untidy. His smile was devilish but kind. I did not give him any spare
change. He quickly averted his attention toward another soloist about a
few meters behind me.

There was a time in the past when I imagined myself walking the streets
of Manila, with a placard containing cryptic message, begging for alms.
What could the reasons be that I had to escape all civilized endeavors
and be a vagabond? I wanted to know how difficult it must feel knowing
that pedestrians would never look at me the same way. Also, could I go
under the radar long enough for everyone to forget I ever existed? It is
possible, I thought, since authorities pay no attention to missing
individuals of little importance to society. Make no mistake: this was
out of curiosity and not of deluded romanticism.

I guess, I just wanted to travel by foot, see where my legs would take
me.

**she danced with the 17 roses unceremonously.** there was a hint of
contentment, though. i think the 13th and 14th roses are her flings. i
can tell by the way her lady friends shrill their *kilig*. she must make
a choice soon, though. it is a fickle thing, *love*, especially at such
an age when the body dictates the mind and not the other way.

she is my second cousin. in the clan's customs, everyone should know
everyone, but i have been too busy with the immediate radius that i did
not bother expanding my social circles. because i see no good point in
it, pretending to want to be around a relative i barely grew up with.

and yet, i was watching her enjoy herself.

they hired singers, too. i forgot what the guy was singing in this part,
but it was very good. the quality of his quips? inversely proportional.

in between dances, my table mates and i would excuse ourselves for a
breath of air. outside the venue, there's a photo booth. we went there.

my hair was unruly, as always, but it was the first time that night that
i saw how terrible the case was. i could pass as the next vocalist of
The Cure. we took pictures anyway.

**back inside**, they already serverd the dessert. it was a
bland gelatin, yellowish in color, almost like a pus. would not be
surprised if it tasted like one too.

my seatmate, Gary, turned to me and said, "everyone is about to cry." i
looked up and saw why.

when the debutante threw her arms around her father, heaps of the crowd
wept. he's the 18th rose. the last dance? aunt says he's been diagnosed
with stage 2 prostate cancer. says his days are numbered.

she has every reason to cry.

my eyes were itchy. must be the dust.

**hotel food is always rubbish.** always prepared sans passion. i have
watched too many cooking shows, and that must be the reason why i expect
so much every time.


**soon enough**, the old man was drunk and making noises again, as were
his table mates. thirty minutes before the party even began, they were
already drinking shots of double black. he brings shame wherever he
goes. there's that.

**does anyone wish people stopped attaching definitions to a certain
name?** i do. in my dream, i am always not me, which is good.

**a good drive** is doing at least 60kph in EDSA. EDSA! i am talking
about the most notorious avenue in the country being a free road!

driver, step on it, would you? get me out of here.

double black, per the suggestion of our resident ortho, must be tried by
anyone who fancies a clean hit, because "it's smoother than the black
label when it comes to sensation."

i was going to ask him to expound on this topic, but seeing the
speedometer swerve between 99 and 101 while cruising homebound on skyway
should be enough for me an evidence of his DUI as i leaned my head back
and closed my eyes.

bus stops full of air and smoke and not of people standing beneath,
because they no longer wait in safe places. they would rather jump
aboard anything that whooshes by above 40 kph than fan themselves in
boredom near suspicious-looking smugs. if you flag down something, be
prepared to run after it. it does not stop for anyone, and who you are
going to be after this commutation determines a good, at least decent,
fate only if you were alert. attention here is crucial. as is everywhere
else, i suppose.

it is rather simplified, i guess---the clouds spinning
invariably to form a greater cause of casualty, wherein the issues
involved do not attenuate the fear of getting struck by the heaven's
bolt, let alone help one to crawl back under a shade; that in this
dreamy hour, all rambling and rain-swept, i step back to the discomfort
of my moving legs, my first walk to my first school. it is just a lane
away from here. not too far. but to the calendars on which my memories
are taped may already be pushed way back in the distant space; and
need i some treading to reach it once again. again, for the sake of
doing something.

the learning center has been shut down for years. beyond the gates, last
i checked, were the peering capsules that used to modify the future
heroes whose guardians did not mind throwing away their money to the
modes, albeit ridiculous as i have learned in the grapevine, of
education that was never saintly contrary to the used-to slogan. as a
child, i was not informed of the ways of payroll. no child should ever
be burdened of it. here, i only learned the fundamentals.

my first school teacher, Carol, already a divorcée when i met her, said
that i was a brilliant kid. she stamped my hand with a purple star
labeled *very good*. i knew that apple was red, and that one apple added
to another makes two apples. rough guess: i was not born stupid.

it smelled like an infirmary, her small office, although at the time, i
did not know what infirmaries smelled like. the janitors, perhaps in
seeing that they would be mingling with kids everyday, had to sanitize
everything to bleach white. the basic stench could have fried our little
neurons, but i need a good source to back this up. it remains an
observation, untested in the laboratory or at the field of ascetic
hypotheses.

father told me her son died due to food poisoning. out of neglect. which
is why her husband decided to leave her for good. 

teacher Carol erected the center in memory of her dead son. thinking
about it now, it is weird, since the back story was unfit to support the
beams of this mini-institution, the slow degradation injected to the
thoughts of young enrollees, i included. the legacy lived on in spite of
it. the valedictory speech that excluded any formal attempts of
greeting, reduced to a simple nod to while away the persecutors perched
on their seats.

however, coming to grips, yes, this is it: mi último adiós, to the
necessities unfailingly dismissed by the order of hand landing briskly
on their cheeks.

it is often without good reason that i tend to push the things needed to
be done further into the calendar until pressure builds at one corner,
but today, four days from deadline, amid the tangle and toss of Recto
("rectum of Manila," Sionil José once said), i finished something
significant. i don't feel proud, though. just tired. and weary.

they say that delaying the accomplishment of a task improves the
quality of output. practitioners from the
medicine field might not agree on this.

din regurgitates into being much "oblivionism", a state in which no
other states exist except nothingness itself. and maybe train tracks,
and the train on it, and the people aboard the train. are they part of
this whole new nothingness experience? maybe, of the entire
consciousness where the 'soul' arrives.

every station is a new quest to find ways of austere astral jaunts, to
seek thrills that are slowly consuming. i think if alchemy were real, it
would be the grounds of metaphorical truths. or rather, it is only true
in metaphors.

nebulous cries dissolve in time, and as they do, they are converted to a
new form of energy, as if lead being transmuted to gold, poison to
elixir, burden to enlightenment.

i, mor(t)al, am running alongside a train trying to outrun it, all the
while singing a christmas carol. in here, however, one has no lordship
over one's speed. one simply witnesses oneself play for the theatrics of
one's mind.

i find it less odd to know how slow i am in a race against a machine.

i woke up feeling golden, which is not startling.

### Entry # 148: *for someone who dismisses horoscope, this is it*
Date: Wed, 13 Aug 2014

we can stay and be friends. 

we'll watch together other sunset photographers fill their portfolios with
overused motifs and themes---the same fibonacci of flowers against a
tangerine opacity---but let me not blame them for marveling at the
picturesque facets of nature, how they point their cameras westward
feebly, funny because it could not be helped. i can imagine how helpless
they must feel, unable to temper that desire to document all that is
beyond their hands, as most of the time, i feel that, too, when putting
to words my thoughts on certain aspects of living. humans can capture
through manic simulations that elusive beauty of nature, although our
copies only asymptotically arrive to what could qualify as good. give a
few more years, decades.

from our vista that is like no other, watch how bats flutter at the low
altitudes of the metropolitan squabble, and wonder, as we should, where
do they go to sleep? do they have caves here somewhere (perhaps, beneath
a footbridge) made out of guanos and stalactites? i'd like to see that---with you,
of course. i think of their migration from provinces to the
capital, clouds of them filling the skyline of roxas blvd. motorists
would stomp on their brakes, and cars would pile up from baywalk to
nowhere, all of them looking up at squeaking portents, flying bats.

in this note, i'd like to know if manileños are a curious lot? i mean,
to the point of giving in to the cessation, just to watch (with us, of
course) any motion of ill omen.

but we are too absorbed to be anything else. only seldom we focus.

cities are full of noise. never has telecommunication been so important.
white screeches and negative feedbacks, night lights blotting out the
stellar pyre: anti-magic in the form of hidden humanity, anti-motivation
in the form escapism. nonetheless, both cannot be heard nor seen, even
if one pays attention.

too much for too long, the blankness in expression expresses that much
diffidence pervading throughout the air, reaching zeniths, but not way,
way up and out. we nominate which of our scriptures would ascend in air
to be carried to places, the best breath we can part with the wind. it
is up to the newest methods we have at our disposal if such texts and
tones will land on their destinations. even then, we are barely
understood. as peers, we have been out of touch. as colleagues, we are
too arrogant in advertising ourselves. in the end, we wake up to the
same monotony that cannot be auto-tuned.

however, stay---for the vodka ever so vivifying; for the superlative
factors that we have yet to seek, many of which do not belong anywhere
and anywhen else but here and now. the future might not be as amazing as
it looks, and the past, despite my previous convolutions, apprehensive. i
hope we can visit soon a big observatory, that i can disprove myself
these allegations.

when i seek peace at the roundabout, i do not expect that something good
will come out of it. as a matter of fact, through the years, i have
leaned on an incline where bad outcomes outweigh the good. if a man
would jump out of a corner with an ice pick on his hand, then i know i
was not wrong in thinking of the lurking harm that riddles the unseen.

when i seek peace on my bed via slumber, then it is another experience
altogether. yes, it could feel swift, but it should not be as
detrimental a sensory as the one above.

it has been bothering me, however, for quite some time now, when the
solemn act of sleeping (alone on a wide bed, preferably) cuts into the
known dimensions of space. physically, it is not possible, or at least,
not yet to laymen. but that is what i hope to achieve: to rip through
the rift and jump to the morrow in the most efficient way. meaning,
arriving at point B from point A expending minimum effort. 

i lie there, eyes closed, illusions of time are chucked to the null. it
does not matter when i retire early or late at night. my body clock
wakes me up at the same hour: 10 AM.

time supposedly is a man-made abstraction, a term coined to describe the
passing duration; a word that tells something about an organism's age in
a language humans can understand; represented as *t* in calculations. if
i were to talk about the virtues of time, wouldn't it be just a waste of
it? but how can such non-material concept be wasted? most importantly,
did i oversleep again?

to transfer all the bile polluting the organ beneath the chest out of
the system; the fluid finds its way somewhere non-hepatic, somehow. to
transfer it all from the random sketches of envy and venom to the fangs
of a lower serpent, and out to the bunks of the underworld waiting, if
only that were anatomically possible.

i haven't been to an ocean's floor. more so, it is not dead. even more
so, it does not wish to receive my refuse, and at the same time, i don't
want a trace of humanity among its dark depths. and yet here i go,
casting now and casting more. every segment is an episode of quivering
motion. this is dilemma setting in. either that, or i, at this
unfortunate slice of moment, am too blind to see what is visible to
many, too dumb to derive a conclusion based on the provided evidence.
whichever holds true, and truth being one coming from a third neutral
perspective, for the time being, i assume the former.

i know what you (future-me) are thinking. you think i have overruled the
impossibility of mistake by disabling that which only mechanically
functions nowadays. then, you are wrong. your instructor, flawed and
hemispherical, does not benefit from the perverse discretion of
isolation. for all i know, it is a symptom. you are fermenting your own
in a vat, full to the brim with nothing but. 

it is fermented: the blaring news. and now you know.

...

gist in one question: how do i deal with such intemperance?

...

sometimes, i wonder if there's a benefit in addressing the current
problems to a person from a different spacetime, and if such benefit
would be immediately, effectively, noticed by the one who is babbling
(me). that no matter how hard i suppress dem feelz, they only flow in
every direction but inward. 

lo, this is another low, the newest actually, delivered unto me in a
quick fire through the account of a similarly aquatic drone, but under
no circumstance is it intentional. my part here is atlantic.

abundance of a source, as long as it is free and safe, is never the
subject nor the issue. you know how the
imps whisper into the ears of winos but not nibble at the rim of the ale
bottle? there are no 'dirty' things. there are only \'dirty' people.

someone once told me that a shot is enough to displace one's beliefs,
depending on the quality and content. i held on to this, although i've
never dreamed of evolving into an active bar brawler. i am a lever not a
fighter. by that, i mean i am more of finding leverage in other means
rather than submit my physique to a process of reduction. if, however,
the only way to deal with the situation is a hand-to-hand combat, i'd go
and give it my game.

the problem is, i seldom go to bars, because they are all filled with
noisy people. noisy people alone are fine, but noisy people quarantined
in the confines of alcohol -- that is a different brooding. i've seen in
those spaces how my contemporaries were bred further into bad
socialites. therefore, the chances of my hitchhiking onto a fist-fest
are slim. there in bars, my blood boils for some reason, my veins pop,
my teeth grind my teeth. this is unnatural. my temper is not usually
disorderly. besides, i am too broke to be wagging my tail bone
around, pretending i need new phone pals, because i don't.

i wheeze, but i strive to smile and be thoughtful. and my poor metallic
curse cures itself poorly; and that's how things are *here*.

the last time prior to checking out of a reggae bar, i stomped too hard
on the pedal of a bass drum. i questioned too why the featured bands
imitate a jamaican accent. one of them looked very oriental, his eyes,
and yet he formulated his voice to sound differently. *be yourself*, i
thought. amid the kung-fusion, i sat placidly with a free beer in hand.
who was i to contemplate?

friends let their friends get left behind, burning at ice palaces, not
looking back, apologies fleeing from the stares, for they have stolen
something they couldn't return, because they thought i had embarrassed
them. the only way to confront this was with a mild sedative.

nevertheless, my goodness is still in tact.

it might take me a long time to go again where the mass is happy while
the roads are splitting open, the ceilings ablaze with phosphorescence.
at some corners, there would be voyeurs asking for bruises in some
conduits, and accidentally eyeing on them makes me uncomfortable.

so, i've never been this eager to feel so mega after feeling so milli. i
try not to be impulsive.

it was almost an honest moon, stars striking our cordial conversation,
when the one-sided attraction lost my favors by a rub. i always kept a
fact sheet of data to present to a future ignominy, however unpromising
the fluctuations had been, to be as scientific as possible. but is it
really possible to be scientific in dealing with these kinds of things?

in many attempts, the prowess extraordinaire of the limbic system
transcends logic. this abstract made the scene serene, almost palpable.
somewhere were the lost pieces of fullness as evidenced by how the way
the lips once parted in marvel. all the data confirmed the sense that
both internal and external realities are amalgamated into a, usually,
post-nocturnal nicety---truly a far better embrace of *the* truth,
albeit stupidly so.

your poise croons under the bridge, throwing rocking bits to strangers.
those you have hit will puke into the river below in agony. the river
becomes rueful because of this. but, you take your needs and nutrients
from the river. the murky water you drink worsens your poise, further
desolating whatever still remains of your inhibition. sometimes, you
wonder if there's a way of elating out this cycle.

anguish corrupts worse than any carnelian lethargy, but, as i have
experienced, a lot of looking inward and meditating in the trenches of
thoughtless words, there is a chance to weaken altogether the sensation,
or at least turn some of it as excess heat. peering down on myself from
an altered perspective might sound obtrusive, but in examining why and
how my core diminishes from time to time gives me sense in a way. we
have altars no other being can hold. we have temples; and within those
complex, we can make anything out of something so perilous.

You define the counterargument for the stakes that firmly hold the
discipline (or the absence thereof) of being an urban crook. And this
without hesitation is my main absolution as to why am I in front of you,
kissing the gratitude onto your knees one small, dutiful peck at a time.
Maybe you would pat my forehead as if patronizing the humility of my
expression, but whether this will be the case, I have long since thrown
my speculations out the proverbial window; and I have since then assumed
that you must be a great thinker in the previous arrangement of your
very atoms, for you (and only you, of all the beings I have met) only
deflect any stimuli of hooligan-ness away from you with garlands and
grace. Personally, I don't think of it as a bad thing.

In time, everything will forge again routines, and those will break into
fractals; and all shall be back to their excellent simplicity where I
would like to find myself stuck. Maybe, you'd be there.

block of hindrance is in front of me. i am done submitting applications.
the next step is to do it again the following day, wait for response,
get back to the new house, and live with new people. and in the
meantime, i can take solace in the brain-firing convulsions of dota[^dota].

it understands the nature of being in the know-how, i mean, this special
canine that i have in my hands, it sniffs the fire, be it provincial or
sentimental, and somehow, it knows what to do with it. i think of it as
a rare phenomenon: a smart, ambitious dog igniting amid several knots
of mischief its curiosity one sniff at a time. for a species to evolve
into a self-destructive maniac like humans, it is deemed important to
have that drive to know more of oneself, one's surroundings, tools, the
world, the space outside the world, and whatever forces, laws, and/or
momenta that govern habitability in the plane on which one experiences
realities. and, somehow, this dog "has it all".

laughter fades at the smallest hint of crass misdirected while i

excited grin---says more of the chum that has found its Imaginary
residence.

i find the tactlessness of people out of time and out of place, since
most of them are fueled by ancient vendetta. this is why one (or
probably all) of my friends is a toilet.

i don't usually not dodge persons but smiling---the feeling is

among the weeks that have me anchored to a(nother) foreign house not
ours, it could not get any duller than this one, largely because of
monotony. it sucks to be *and* not to be tethered to the webz,
especially when mad thoughts are flung my way for no good reason and
with no readily available medium to divert it to.

the old man comes
around for a drink, but i despise having to share a drink with him. he
gets too hyped and cannot control what he says and how he says them when
the spirits have come to meet him dizzy. last time, i just stared at the
night sky while he was babbling with his cheap principles, and i could
not even recognize the big dipper. the incandescence of street lamps
have washed the twinkles of stellar dots. being around this old man when
that happens is something i did not dream of.

dreamed of my brother the other night. he had shorter hair. he had
styled it so that the front bundle was spiked outwards. anyway, life

Oh, weathered in the most natural position you can assume, epidermis
cawing for the monsoon. You court the dregs of precipitation before its
droplets even land on the garden.

Greetings from the light brown earth scorched under the gradual movement
of solar impatience. Light brown to dark. Dark brown to darker brown.
Like how it is in the early levels of Blendoku. The shades step down one
point from detachment, towards the pit.

Waking up to a body enfeebled during the wee hours of morning as if
sleep had become fatigue. Corpulent figures from dreamscape seem
augmented to fit the large space of imagination. Walking up the patio
and you find the door locked. Waking up to check your pocket if you had
the keys, only feeling stupid after reality had set in.

Dehydrated and weak and irritated by the blatant insinuations of
Belphegor, it that none of your delegates would want to know of. You
barely managed to pull yourself up and attend to your bodily needs. At
times like this, you wish there was an anatomical valet of sorts that
would carry off of you your piss and shit without you having to go to
the loo.

Consequently, your mind wanders to another unrelated idea: you think if
only you could pull your heart straight out of your chest without being
messy, and try to see if this tireless, selfless organ really is the
epitome of all that is, was, and will ever be romantic. No, it cannot
be. In a few forceful forthbringing to fruition, the day will have
reached its hottest. Smile because the time is not yet. Pull your eyes
shut again and sleep again.

This time, it is about your molar: it wiggles in its place, and you pull
it out of your gums. This tooth is habituated by larvae on the underside
of it. Waking up so anxious to mumble, "Oh the Anguish!" And so against
the mutiny of odds you proceed. You crush the joblessness behind a
skinny electronic with relative ease, only this time, you shuffle
between review materials and the cacophony of those two lovely hounds.
Blessed beings they are, might I add, although you wonder if they were
asking for a mild touch.

(Somewhere therein is a pause disguised as a sigh, a pause to be
grateful that it will soon be over.)

You are bored and you tell no one but the passers-by about it. And so,
out of the blue, you make up at least three stories to inconvenient
them, which are the following -- 

**One**: *My nana used to call me a constellation boy, and wow, how it
snacked on my being. There were instances that I would look into her
eyes, and would see mierda swirling through maelstrom. Apparently, my
back was perforated with scars from bed bugs and prepubescent zits. I
did not know how to deal with bed bugs and back acne at the time*. *I
beckoned the presence of a parent to tell off my nana, but no one came.
I don't blame her, though, my nana. My back was indeed a Picasso's
painting of pus.* 

**Two***: It is in looking inwardly that I visit the places I have never
been, or places that could never be. Imagination, although at best a
fickle aspect of the human condition, takes me anywhere. I hope I can
really travel soon, you know.* 

**Three**: *I once put my arm 'unknowingly' around the person I was
dating, and she told me that I was a Scam, that there is no such thing
as 'unknowingly' putting one's arm around the corporeal being of
another. I saw her smiling, though. Does that mean anything?*

---Such downpour of mad prose skills can flood España Blvd in seconds,
but to your dismay, none of them gives a damn about your orations, and
so you snap out of it. 

(Another pause. This time, covered in slumber.)

Waking up to an unknown rage seemingly so self-sufficient and
sycophantic that it takes only a few moments to figure out that there
sits a vermilion on the sclera of the mind's eye. 'Tis the weather again
you are rambling about. Well, it must be it.

Short stories of Borges did not help last night. Rain dance to the
melody of Alesana's *Ambrosia* did not help either. What could be that
one thing the might assist you in fending off the persistent tapping of
ennui and enigma? Eight glasses of water? Ten? No matter how hard you
wish for the sun to go away, it just won't. It stays in its rightful
place up in the sky, flashing. It makes you think: a prominence *is *the
sun's way of smiling. It makes you stutter. It blinds you of the
morrow.

i bide the rigors of impunity with the tempest of glance, but in accord
to that personal action which barely, if at all, alleviates the
pressure, i am aware of the recent "ghosts" assailing me at the dead of
night. however, i will only acknowledge them while they aren't here yet,
and in ambiguity.

forgive me cardiologists for i have sinned. it is not
a matter of health but the absence of it. it is not about the elements
of dissatisfaction that continuously edit into me how and why i may not
be going the right way, although that could fairly be overridden with
exercising the will. while the heart is overly stated in literary air

i did not know what to make of the situation, the postponed surprise for
people who initially said yes but in the end backed out, that in that
moment when i saw again him after many years, the celebrant's figure
shocked me. from 90 or so kilograms, he thinned down to 40-something in
a short period of time.

i remember him making fun of me because of my feral hair-do, suggesting
that i'm two white strands shy from being a 'dyslexic scientist'.

while whole point of this festivity is for him to regain his previous
health, i doubt the medicine field has developed perfect treatment for
his acute syndrome. i wish him well. i wish him...contentment.
