An incomplete list of blogs that I find interesting currently.

[Ava](https://blog.avas.space/)
: writes about their hobbies and projects, tech, health, Right to
Repair, Car-free Cities, and other things that I vibe with.

[Em](https://www.conscienceround.com/)
: likes writing, and people, and maybe writing about people, that maybe
gut-punches the reader, but not in a horrible way.

[False Knees](https://falseknees.tumblr.com/)
: is an Art Tumblr, containing mostly webcomics about birds.

[Gemma Copeland](https://gemmacope.land/)
: is interested in and works on many things, including "imagin[ing] post-growth
futures," something I also find myself thinking about on a regular
basis.

[Hund](https://hunden.linuxkompis.se/)
: is a "slow-tech philosopher" who is into computer stuff. We
align on many things computer-related, but I always find
something to learn from them.

[Hundred Rabbits](https://100r.co)
: is a two-person artist collective who, most of the time, operates on their
sailboat Pino, making art using some of their homebrewed FOSS.

[Low-tech Magazine](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com)
: explores "past and often
forgotten technologies and how they can inform sustainable energy
practices" from their solar-powered server in Barcelona.

[maia arson crimew](https://maia.crimew.gay/)
: writes about cyberpunk, hacktivism, and other technical articles. I'm
interested in their thoughts about cybersecurity in general.

[Matthew Cambion](https://starbreaker.org/)
: contains, like many of us, multitudes: a metalhead; generally
irreligious, anti-authoritarian, and anti-capitalist; and also an
incorrigible geek (all his words).

[Mandy Brown](https://everythingchanges.us/)
: talks about the more progressive practices that we could/should have
in our workplaces.

[Manu Moreale](https://manuelmoreale.com/)
: loves (maybe) the Venn diagram of minimalism and web development,
and often talks about the overlap of the two.

[Sol√®ne Rapenne](https://dataswamp.org/~solene/)
: likes to share her findings on niche operating systems like NixOS
and BSDs.

[The Amphibian](https://www.marianilad.com/)
: is written by Maria
Nilad, a Filipina poet and essayist who offers "medicine and solutions
in equal measure, for anxious environmentalists, cynical humanists, and
kin-makers of all kinds."

[The Perry Bible Fellowship](https://pbfcomics.com/)
: is a webcomics drawn by Nicholas Gurewitch with good art laced with a
tinge of dark humor.

[Winnie Lim](https://winnielim.org/)
: tries to lead a purposeless life and writes publicly about it such
that I question myself when am I going to be deliberate about my
aimlessness.
