## Abstract

In this article, I talk about my personal experience using FOSS, how it
affects my regular choices when obtaining a new piece of technology,
when going about my daily life, and how it might (or might not) affect
the society at large, especially if it is to be pitted against the
"convenience" delivered by Big Tech products and services, all within
the context of where I live in, the so-called Philippines.

## Niche as function

Using free and open source software (FOSS) outside of software
engineering career is a niche of a niche in a developing country like
the so-called Philippines, kind of like riding [a singlespeed fixed-gear bike](/50)
with at least one brake (I have two, front and back, "just to be
safe"). Even so, the tiny space is not claustrophobic (both in FOSS and in
my fixie example) because it is more of a rabbit hole leading to other
interesting fields, which I would not have reached otherwise.

Where I live, if one could afford a personal computer (PC), one expects
Microsoft Windows as the operating system. If they are rich enough,
though, they might opt for a Macbook, and thus macOS.

But with the wider accessibilty and more affordabilty of smartphones,
many people are content with just these mobile devices for their
computing needs. And who would not love having their own portable PCs in
their pockets that, for as cheap as a *very* light snack, can have
mobile data to connect it to the internet?

Sadly, smartphones, and most of the applications in them that have
internet access, have little to no incentive to respect the
owner's privacy, defaulting to collecting as much personal data as it
can send it to companies for further analysis. They analyze these
aggregated data to serve their users with personalized ads, which in
turn would keep them on the platform, so they could gather more
data, and the cycle continues. At one point in this
country's electoral history, Cambridge Analytica helped elect Rodrigo
Duterte, our Trump homebrew but laced with more Chinese
Communist Party spice than Trump himself would have liked. For more info
on this, check the following articles:

That said, smartphones are not *that* bad. They are high tech tools that
can do many things at once, like connect people across huge distances,
perhaps doing virtual things simultaneously like playing online games.
And for many things, they are great! I, for one, need a smartphone if I
were to continue having private and secure communication with end-to-end
encryption with friends and family, which, to wit, cannot happen on
most, if not all, basic and feature phones. On the other hand, Big Tech
companies have the incentive to use smartphones as direct point to
extract resources from the working class, be it in the form of time,
attention, data, or all of the above, with which to concoct more
profit-making and power-consolidating schemes.

Interestingly, both the proprietary software and hardware, especially
in the realm of smartphones, are designed to be that shiny object that
is increasingly hard to put down yet easy to pick up. I know the feeling
since day 1 of me having a smartphone.

## Cult of ambition

I inherited my first smartphone, a cheap one with no-name running
Android, from our [engineering] undergraduate thesis titled,
"Microcontroller-based Bluetooth Surveillance Robot Using Machine Vision
System" that my groupmates and I conceieved to "modernize surveillance
robots" with the help of the smartphone (serving as
control and monitoring device) via Bluetooth, WLAN, and/or Internet.

Looking back on it now, it was dystopic. But if you're an engineering
student in a state university in a developing country, nothing is driven
unto thee as hard and as graceless having ambition. Without it, "Who are
you?" And so the thesis projects from our batch, and the ones that came
before and after us, were nothing but ambitious attempts at engineering,
mainly to please the ambitions of our instructors and professors who did
the same with theirs, but also to have some grand-sounding mouthful
string of text to put to our CVs when we would finally apply for jobs.

Ambition is nice, one would think, but to prop it up requires a solid
foundation.

Take our aforementioned thesis, for example. The knowledge
we should have had to make it all possible---including, but not limited
to, working grasp on *and* access to microcontrollers; some computer
programming; computer networking; working knowledge on robotics and/or
mechatronics; basic welding for metalwork---was not
taught to us because of lack of resources: university funding for
necessary lab equipment; more engineering instructors with the technical
know-how; personal computers and/or smartphones for students to access
materials from the internet; etc.

Yet, to graduate from college, i.e., be finally "free" and start
working, we were forced to participate in this culture of ambition---a
recurring theme in Silicon Valley tech companies, I would find out
later, filled with rotten techbros---instead of looking for interesting
ways appropriate technology or permacomputing can affect our lives using
existing tech. And to participate, many of us, our team included, had to
outsource the technical aspects of our theses that we knew nothing of to
an enterprising group of tech-savvy people whose business is/was to
design and build college students' "vision" to life. It was not
affordable *at all*. Side note: I don't know if that particular business
is still operating, though I suspect that if you ask any graduating
engineering student from a relatively reputable engineering school, they
would point you to at least one such shop. Also, before you call me out
on violating academic integrity, please check your privilege; "cheating"
is nasty and I don't condone it, but it has been a way of students to
escape the unfairness and injustice that's innate to our current
education system.

I briefly talked with such enterprising tech-savvy people, and at the
time, they were visibly unexcited with the work even if they were, I
think, raking in decent money. Much, much later, I would realize under
different circumstances why: *work* is flipping work, an elaborate
fuckery compounded by misuse of tech, that I would rather not engage in.

But I digress, I digress.

My first smartphone was so cheap it was a small accident away from being a
glorified potato. But for all its unremarkability, it did okay. It had
four-inch capacitive touchscreen, had Bluetooth, connected to wifi, and
had a headphone jack. And most important of all, it worked---our whole
thesis project worked---during thesis defense. I inherited it because at
the time, all my group mates already had a smartphone of their own, and
definitely better than this one.

## As a journeyman

Most enterprising tech-savvy people would not want to extend software
and hardware support for it, let alone bring it back to life. I can't
blame them. Such endeavor requires effort, resources, and time,
something that many of us, myself included, would rather spend on
shinier, newer, and probably objectively better things. And tech
workers, you know, have been conditioned to follow where the obscene
amount of money is. I say that last sentence not to slight them, but to
remind myself also why I am trying to shift into a tech-adjacent career
for the supposed non-trivial pay.

My tech journey after that first phone went boring fast. Years prior,
my college friends would get riled up and geek
over Nokia 5300, and how one of them hacked something in it to access free
internet via WAP (wireless application protocol). The excitement that
pulled us together---it took a long time find that for myself when
working on the things I own.
Now, I'm thinking if getting bored with tech is a
good thing, because that would mean I get to do other stuff Outside.

I vaguely remember what got me into FOSS, to be
honest. It's likely because of some random comment someone on the
internet made about something cool, like the [Tor project](https://www.torproject.org/) or, more likely,
[TAILS](https://tails.net/). Whatever it was, it was my rabbit hole into
FOSS, a path that gets narrower as I proceed and branch off. So much
ground to cover. It doesn't end, the learning; and it could be the answer to
the boredom I've been feeling about tech in general.

### Politics

Now, many years into my FOSS journey, niche as it is, I have somehow
found friends who share the similar sentiments. Unsurprisngly, we
also share similar political leanings, which, let's just say, is mostly
anti-establishment. Believe it or not, one's personal politics does
contribute to how easy or hard it is to transition to using FOSS. Many
things in life, including and especially tech, cannot be divorced from
politics with a wave of hand or by simply ignoring the nuances.

As an anecdotal example, I heard that authoritarian leftists in the
country (whose politics I denounce, for the record) working underground
use a mish-mash of Linux and FOSS apps as their tech stack to operate,
while I have yet to hear the same thing from the State's military and
police. In fact, the latter, from I what limited info I know, crawl and
scour big social media apps like Facebook, because, let's face it, these
platforms are treasure troves for personal and/or incriminating data.

### Choosing Linux

Anyway, deciding to use Linux as my main OS was a major turning point in
my FOSS journey. And it was not done overnight. It took many months of
research: what Linux distribution (or "distro") would be the best
starting point for those switching from Windows; what hardware would be
best for such distro; what apps to use; etc. From what I could glean
from those who have been here before me, the Linux landscape is more
forgiving now compared to ten or so years ago. That means even when
operating from a framework different than the traditional ones with more
profit incentives, FOSS (and most likely free culture) can be and has
been fertile ground for innovation and development. The fruits of labors
of all developers and designers *will* reach the masses, if they have
not already, and everyone will be able to use them for their daily
computing needs, no matter the complexity.

Even from the get go, I was already shopping for lean Linux (Leanux?)
distro, because I've seen the baggage of a bloated OS and how it "gets
in the way" of Productivity. I would eventually look for leaner
programs, which is how I came to know and love [vim, the text editor](https://www.vim.org/)
and other text-based user interface (TUI) programs.

## Requiem: right to repair

More curious things happened.

Getting into FOSS has empowered me to
configure the system to something I like, from customizing the look and
feel to even blocking ads at the OS level. Many FOSS communities
encourages to tinker with your own devices, and would also remind that
you make back-ups before doing so. This mindset then led me deeper,
beneath the software---to the bunch of semiconductors and pieces of
metal that does the computation. Small steps like swapping RAM or
replacing the hard drive, if both is even possible on the computer, can
be exhilerating for a non-technician like me who just wants to not have
to buy another computer if/when this one stops working for some reason.

Exploring this has intensified my support for our right to repair the
devices we own. Software depends on the hardware and maintaining the
latter is just as important as that the former.

Repairing stuff, however, is neither new nor that radical concept for
me. In developing countries, repair is just a way to extend an object's
life. Repair is not necessarily seen as a political act, although it can
and has been; it is another service that someone might offer as a
non-expensive alternative to buying new. Here, technicians for all kinds
of tech are abundant, at least in major city centers; and so having
one's broken stuff repaired will not break bank.

Still, when I read about how Big Tech overseas design their products
with planned obsolescence, I wonder what kind of world do the top
stakeholders of, say, Apple, imagine when they ship AirPods, which,
according to [iFixit's Airpods Repair](https://www.ifixit.com/Device/AirPods)
page, scores *zero* out of ten in terms of repairability.

The wastefulness of Global North negatively impacts the overall quality
of life for those in Global South. The neocolonialism of the former
continues to carve out non-renewable resources from the latter, powered
by modern slavery and multiple environmental catastrophe.

## Smash convenience

STEM makes great strides forward. Scientists and engineers go on to make
better technologies to improve our quality of life. It affords us a
degree of convenience. But there can be such thing as too much
convenience. We risk losing our ability for problem solving, which we
would leave to those who know how. And it is not affordable *at all*,
remember?

We place too much value on
convenience at the expence of other lives, even of our lives; we just do
not know that yet. There are a lot of boring and menial work that we
would rather outsource to the machines, but I think we're still far from
full automation. For example, recall the humanoid bots at the Tesla
event last October 2024, after which TechCrunch reports: "[Tesla Optimus bots were controlled by humans during the ‘We, Robot’ event](https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/14/tesla-optimus-bots-were-controlled-by-humans-during-the-we-robot-event/)."
Tesla's tech, in reality, could not have worked on its own without human
intervention.

Currently, I am *trying* to pivot into a career path that ensures
privacy and security of people, with the hopes of one day giving back to
my communities. The technological landscape of the future is too murky
to be left alone to the surveillance of states and corporations, both
banking on us to choose the easiest paths. I'd rather be the tech worker
that sides with the working class, not as another pawn of the capital to
further enrich them. For now, though, I'm looking for other ways to
smash the looms, so to speak.

If Luddites smashed the looms as a protest against their working
conditions, what does it mean to be a neo-Luddite? To me, it means using
a wide range of tech---from the simpler Unix command line tools to the
more complex self-hosted open source large language models; even opting
for "(s)lower" tech ones like second-hand city bicycles---NOT to serve
the already huge conglomerates whose state agents' boots are upon our
necks. More modern interpretations to "smashing the looms":

- rendering the tools of surveillance capitalism obsolete;
- making the source codes for ALL proprietary software free and open
  source;
- pirating and sharing proprietary tools and their blueprints and
  schematics, and/or repurposing them to create something that doesn't
  necessarily have inherent Productive Value;
- repairing and maintaining tools for as long as possible, be it
  software or hardware;
- changing the narrative about what is and is not possible in the tools
  we use today by starting with taking the mic from the oligarchy;
- [SPACE LEFT INTENTIONALLY BLANK; How would you smash the looms?]
