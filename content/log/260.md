## Brief review of *My Friends in the Barrios*

[Dr. Juan M. Flavier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Flavier) offers
insights from barrio people
who have their own unique wisdom stemming from the life that is simpler
than urban life. Still, the problems that assail us are similar and
interconnected, no matter the environment.

Even though the book is light read, it is packed with insights that
city-dwellers could learn from.

Base on my experience, STEM people would readily dismiss such insights.
Flavier, as a man of medicine himself and having lived in the barrio,
does well in bridging the scientific with the traditional wisdom, and
distills the interaction into something that many of us can relate to.

BONUS: This book includes beautiful line drawings by one Tanchi Mendoza,
depicting different barrio scenes. The sketches remind me, in a good
way, my elementary textbooks.

## Duterte arrested for crimes against humanity

On 11 MAR 2025, former president Rodrigo Duterte was served warrant and
arrested for his crimes against humanity. See relevant articles below:

- ICC: [Situation in the Philippines: Rodrigo Roa Duterte in ICC custody](https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/situation-philippines-rodrigo-roa-duterte-icc-custody)
- Reuters: [Philippines sends ex-President Duterte to ICC over 'drugs war' killings](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/philippines-edge-prospect-arrest-ex-president-duterte-over-drug-war-2025-03-11/)
- AP: [Philippine ex-leader Duterte is being flown to The Hague to face charges of crimes against humanity](https://apnews.com/article/rodrigo-duterte-manila-philippines-icc-9b9d08b8832b43282db53418535fb245)

- Rapper: [Duterte’s arrest was ‘by the book,’ within ICC’s liberal rules — experts](https://www.rappler.com/philippines/experts-analysis-duterte-arrest-valid-within-icc-liberal-rules/) ([Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20250314114733/https://www.rappler.com/philippines/experts-analysis-duterte-arrest-valid-within-icc-liberal-rules/))
- Manila Bulletin: [Ex-president Duterte arrested for crimes against humanity—Palace](https://mb.com.ph/2025/3/11/ex-president-duterte-arrested-for-crimes-against-humanity-palace)

At best, we have mixed reactions. Amid the turmoil surrounding Duterte's
arrest, could some of us find [joy](/joyful-militancy) in this performance?

Some friends celebrated when this news first broke out. Along
with links to the news, they wished us a good and hearty lunch, implying
that we should enjoy this moment with them, if only in spirit.

The vengeful spirit in me wanted to rejoice with them and with the
families of victims of Duterte's [bloody drug war](/drugwar). But
instead, we tried wallowing in the short wave of good vibes, which are
hard to come by these days, this fiasco seem to elicit from progressive
people close to us.

However, many of my friends remain torn on the matter.

For one, many of Duterte's critics all over social media are already
celebrating, because of the supposed justice "we" have already achieved.
We need to be cautious when we promulgate these types of narratives.

We must think about the following:
- **Is justice already achieved?** As far as we know, the trial is
  on-going, and decision on this case won't come out until much, much
  later. For context, the Pre-Trial Chamber I of the International
  Criminal Court set set the confirmation of charges hearing for 23 SET 2025. For all we know, the guy might not even live long enough to know the verdict.
- For those not impacted by the violence of Duterte's drug war, **are we
  not [tokenizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokenism) those who
  are?** When we revel online on Duterte's arrest, are we doing it in
  solidarity with the families of victims of the drug war, or is it
  merely performing for our audience?
- **How else might we combat the disinformation and propaganda machine
  of Duterte et. al.?** Do we really need to "fight fire with fire"?

In the end, it does not matter whether Duterte is delivered to the Hague
to face accountability (in whatever form that may be). The whole process
still will not repair the harm done by the extrajudicial killings that
his power has/had enabled. Him facing justice (via video conference?)
does not resolve the stigma against drug users, and certainly does not
sway our collective beliefs towards
[abolition of incarceration](/abolition) and into a more
[transformative alternatives to justice](/transformative-justice).

But more important than what I think, we should allow the victims and
their families have some sense of justice as well. If this gives them
hope, they deserve to latch on to it.

## My first time in National Museum of Fine Arts

It was my first time ever in [National Museum of Fine Arts](https://www.nationalmuseum.gov.ph/our-museums/national-museum-of-fine-arts/).

Getting there by way of [public transportation](/transpo) is neither
easy nor pedestrian friendly. We think the entrance should be
hedged and/or canopied with [more] trees to soften the glare of the sun. But at
least there is no entrance fee at the time of writing this.

With all the walking in and out of multiple halls and exhibits, we
wonder whether it rejuvenated our hearts and soles. I personally did not
feel any eureka moment propelling me to do something creative, except
this write-up maybe?

It's also...draining to gaze and study paintings. Just paintings, likely
hundreds of them of different sizes. I know it is only *a* medium through
which artists could express themselves, but after hours of frolicking in
poorly lit halls, "Oil on canvas" had become monotonous.

### Ternocon 2025: Filipiniana X Obra

Aside from my being first time there, this exhibit was one of the other
reason we pushed with the visit, and a refreshing final stop at that.

This exhibit feature the works of different designers who made three
different wears---[terno](https://vogue.ph/fashion/the-terno-today/),
[balintawak](https://philippinefolklifemuseum.org/portfolio-items/balintawak/),
and
[kimona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_and_clothing_in_the_Philippines#Kimona_and_Patadyong)---all
of which must be inspired
by single piece of artwork of a national artist.

## Walk with the neighbor

One night, when I had just gone out to walk the dog, our neighbor
approached us and started to talk.

Understandably, she was more drawn to my dog-friend, whose age she
asked.

I said, "Around eight. You could see already the fur turning white on
the face."

Neighbor then reminisced her dog who passed at a young age of one year
old. I listened to her memories about how the pup would greet her
everytime she came in from outside.

We shared a short walk before we had to turn right to some street, and
she had to cross to the other side.

## Brief review of *Strange Intimacies*

Zea Asis's collection of essays reminds me of the writing of Joan Didion.
Hers (Asis's) is a mindful, soulful examination of self and others through self.
And reading her words I would liken to drinking cold tea after going
through the messy parts of outdoors.
