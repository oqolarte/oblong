A project is a vow that must be done by those who agree to engage in it.

Project management is the process of completing a set of goals
within constraints, usually time, budget, and quality.

Stakeholders are the people and entity directly affected by the project.
Including the project manager, vendors, contractors, consultants,
end clients, end users, etc.

Project manager is the one at the center, the gravity
(or glue, whichever works) that keeps everyone in tact.
They also (try to) maintain the project's conceptual integrity,
a state in which stakeholders both understands and agrees
with its goals, principles, direction, and priorities.

will always conspire against everything that's been set up.
4. Executing
