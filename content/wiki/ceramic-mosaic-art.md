## Best practices for mosaic QR code

1. The distance between each tile should either be zero or the same
   color as the tiles next to it. It is best to avoid white space
   between two black tiles
2. There shouldnâ€™t be a lot of bevel on the tiles. It could reflect
   light and make the lines between the square parts stand out
3. The colors must contrast well. Before making a large, sophisticated
   QR Code, test out a similar smaller version for scannability.
