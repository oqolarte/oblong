## On existential dread

Recently, my mind goes to places that can only be classified as
existentially dreadful, and not knowing the reason why adds to the
despair that I can't help but feel.

It has manifested in at least one dream (nightmare, tbh):

I found myself in a city center with tall buildings. One or two of the
buildings nearby started groaning, and when I looked up, it began
collapsing. As the buildings crumbled around me one by one, I started to
run. But we all know, like oil and water, running and dreams don't mix
well. I was going nowhere, no matter how "fast" I moved my legs.

It's as if a cosmic entity has pinned me with its tendrils into my
proper place. I will oblige, I think, but first I must snap out of it.

But to wake up, I discovered that it must be a conscious
effort: something from within must have been stirred, and
one must have been brave enough to stare into the abyss long enough to
recognize its outer shape, to make something out of it, to do something
about it. It's a very long process, one that involves uneasiness and
jogging in place in sandy Plutonian shores.
I was successful once, when I quit smoking many years ago.
Sometimes, coming around is a collective effort, with loved and trusted ones.
Wait, are we still talking about my dream?

## I have reached my buffet quota

Christmas "parties" are everywhere at this time of the year. One of the
cost-effective ways to celebrate them, according to some employers, is to
have a buffet in known diners.

In the past week alone, I've been in two buffets, both of which were
sponsored by my employer, spaced only three days
apart. Another one is being brewed this week, to which I politely
declined, quipping that the last time I burped, I tasted cholesterol at
the back of my throat. The joke garnered two laugh reacts from my
colleagues.

Buffets in the Philippines are known to be eat-all-you-can, a
bastardization really of waste-what-you-can't. Of course, this is not
unique to Filipinos; many people elsewhere throwaway perfectly edible
food.

And diners will
inevitably waste food despite the numerous signage that discourage them
with a hefty fine. "No leftovers allowed" is often juxtaposed with
plates of meat and carbs and sauce that no longer have a space in
anyone's stomach, each a victim of *takaw tingin*, a local idiom to roughly
mean "food greed."

I have cleaned my plates, emptied my drinks, had my fill.
I'm done with that. At least, for now.
