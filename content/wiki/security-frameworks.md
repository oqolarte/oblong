Security frameworks are guidelines used for building
plans to help mitigate risks and
threats to data and [privacy](/privacy),
such as [social engineering](/social-engineering) attacks and ransomware.

They have four core components:

1. Identifying and Documenting security goals
2. Setting guidelines to achieve security goals
3. Implementing security processes
4. Monitoring and communicating results

## NIST Risk Management Framework

https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/risk-management/about-rmf

1. Prepare: Activities necessary to manage securiy and privacy risks
   *before* a breach occurs
2. Categorize: Develop risk management processes and tasks
3. Select: choose, customize, and capture [documentation](/documentation) of the controls
   that protect an organization.
4. Implement: security and privacy plans for the organization
5. Assess: if established controls are implemented correctly
6. Authorize: Being accountable for the security and privacy risks that
   may exist in an organization.
7. Monitor: be aware how systems are operating

## NIST Cybersecurity Framework

https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework

Action-oriented approach to security, and has 3 elements:

1. Framework Core
   - Identify (ID)
       - Management of [cybersecurity](/cybersecurity) risk and its
         effect on an organization's people and assets
       - Keywords: Asset Management, Business Environment, Governance,
         Risk Assessment, Risk Management Strat
   - Protect (PR)
       - strategy used to protect an organization through the
         implementation of policies, procedures, training, and tools
         that help mitigate cybersecurity threats
       - Keywords: Access Control, Awareness & Training, Data Security,
         Information Protection Processes & procedures, Maintenance,
         Protective Technology
   - Detect (DE)
       - Identifying potential security incidents and improving
         monitoring capabilities to increase the speed and efficiency of
         detections.
       - Keywords: Anomalies & events, security continuous monitoring,
         detectin processes
   - Respond (RE)
       - Making sure that the proper procedures are used to contain,
         neutralize, and analyze security incidents, and implement
         improvements to the security process.
       - Keywords: Response planning, communications, analysis,
         mitigation, improvements
   - Recover (RC)
       - Process of returning affected systems back to normal operation.
       - Keywords: recovery planning, improvements, communications
2. Framework Profile
   - This step aligns business outcomes with cybersecurity activities.
3. Framework Implementation Tiers
   - Maturity levels: Partial, Risk informed, Repeatable, Adaptive
   - Determine first the current risk profile. What, then, would be the
     Target Risk Profile detailing the acceptable levels of risk?
     Security plan is the set of processes required to transition from
     Current to Target.

### Key actions to implement a cybersecurity program

1. Identify business outcomes
2. Understand threats and vulnerabilities
3. Create a current profile
4. Conduct a Risk assesment
5. Create the target profile
6. Decide on the target profile
7. Determine, analyze, and prioritize gaps
8. Implement the plan

## Cyber Kill Chain framework

The [Cyber Kill Chain framework](/cyber-kill-chain) is designed for identification and
prevention of network intrusions.

- Reconnaissance
- Weaponization
- Delivery
- Exploitation
- Installation
- [Command & Control](/c2)
- Actions on Objectives
