## Why

My significant other (SO) is closely related to a desaparecido (desap), someone
who is forcibly disappeared by the state. And since that fateful day, SO
and their family has been rightfully grieving.

People in what I would say chronic grieving tend to not prioritize
addressing their libidos. And that is understandable. As in the case of
SO, they are looking for their desap, which entails intense emotional
labor.

## Loneliness

There is a wave of loneliness that comes to me everytime my libido
strikes yet again. Having a partner with lower sex drive AND knowing
that the state has done us (all of us, actually) bad things, including
but not limited to a loved one being desap, that
probably killed our sex life.

The number of paths, and their divergence, also saddens me. Maybe, I
would rather deal with this funk rather than deep-dive eventually to
full-blown depression if/when this goes on. There is always porn, and I
have busted quite a few *insights* consuming that, but sustaining on it
alon is unhealthy, as it rewires my brain to lean into stranger
fetishes, perhaps reinforcing some misogynistic tendencies.

## Other ideas worth exploring

- Not having enough means to survive puts undue stress to a person's
  psyche. Women have it harder, as they have to also defend themselves
  against sexual violence and abuse on top of addressing their basic
  needs.
    - Adjacent to this, some people---most highlighted, I think, are
      women---sell their bodies for sex. Sex work is an old kind of
      work, because apart from the need for food, human bodies
      apparently must also heed the calls of procreating, but not
      everyone is lucky enough to have someone to share a meaningful sex
      life.
- Can [ethical non-monogamy](/non-monogamy) be the answer to this? That
  is, should people start believing that romantic/sexual love cannot be
  shared between one other person only?
