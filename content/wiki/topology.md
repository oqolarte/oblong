Topology is a field of [math](/math) concerned with properties of shapes
tha stay the same no matter how you squish or stretch them,
as long as one doesn't tear them
or glue things together.

When two continuous functions from one topological space to another
can be "continuously deformed" into the other,
such deformation is called homotopy.
