## Brief review of *Fermat's Enigma*

Author Simon Singh makes sure to shine light on the lives of the
mathematicians, even including portraits, starting from Pythagoras, who
have helped Andrew Wiles complete his work on Fermat's Last Theorem.
Also, who knew that some of them had tragic lives for the simple act of
following their passion?

It's a miracle that while Wiles wiled away fellow math wallowers as he
worked on this theorem in secrecy for seven years, he didn't left a sour
note of "not having enough paper to write proof" and promptly die.

Reading the proofs in the Appendix reminded me of my geometry classes
under Mrs. E during third year of my highschool where she taught us hwo
to construct basic mathematical proof for the theorems we used. I recall
that nice feeling when arriving the logical conclusion of a proof, that
clicking of something when it finally makes sense. (Thanks, Mrs. E!)

## Spending the holidays alone

Honestly, I don't feel lonely which can only be a positive thing. But
more accurately, I haven't been feeling anything recently: just reading,
existing, languishing, from this day to the next.

A friend was hospitalized (she is now fine as of writing this) and I
agreed to take in their dog for one night. The dog created a noticeable
imbalance among my furry friends living with me. Everyone was on edge,
including myself; and I needed to be the one who must manage everyone's
disposition? That's interesting.

I biked to Cubao to buy pen refills and go out on a date with myself.
Browsed some non-fictin books, but the store was unusually crowded at
the time, filled with people recommending which ones their friends could
read next. People-watched for a moment while snacking on burrito, before
deciding its better to do it with someone. That's interesting.
