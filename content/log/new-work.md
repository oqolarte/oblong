**_Concrete jungle where dreams are made of._**

On the fourth Tuesday of March, One Year After Lockdown, I received the following messages (lightly edited for readability, emphasis mine, one SMS per paragraph):

> Can I call po? This is from Energy Development Corporation.
BTW, I'm Mr. Gregorio Magalpoc of the Energy Resource Department.

> We are looking for *highly flammable* and *electrocutable* people that may be of good help in our company. 
BTW, you were recommended to us by your uncle from your great fairy god mother.

> Hello pogi.
Sagutin mo naman yung txt ko.
Parang wala naman tayo pinagsamahan.
*Tanda mo ba nung bumibisita ka sa bar?*
Sabi mo dadagdagan mo yung pang noodles ko.
Di ka na bumalik.
Paborito ko pa naman yung Payless, kasi mura.

I had to read everything more than twice.
I only know a few people who have the gall to message me with these kind of humor out of thin air.
I call it humor because, all things considered, I did find them funny.

When I picked up the call, Ja had an offer.

The following day, I chatted with Ro and Jo, Ja's people, over Zoom about the offer.
