As a non-Swiftie, I had to listen to this much-awaited album drop before
I could roast it *respectfully*.

Album's imagery does not match the sounds. Not that it should, but when
you spend so much on marketing it a certain way, shouldn't you at least
sample the music from that era?

Lyrics do not seem to pay respect either, but the flow of words does
feel familiar. For example, we should know by now that Swift is a fan of
listing things, so much so that she actually has a song called "Wi$h
Li$t."

"Opalite" to me is the only binder in this album of barely banger tunes.

**Rating**: 1 üç∏ out of 5
