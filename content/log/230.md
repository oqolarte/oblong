In a day! Including three rats of varying age and size, and one shrew.
All of them I have found in different stages of decomposition, in
corners one would not necessarily expect them unless one follows the
thick rotting smell.

With a handful of cats and one big dog, all of whom in need of expending
their energy, this has been part of their game:
the sound of fear from tiny squeaking animals and the
smell of death and decay that comes after each of their invisible yet
violent death. Life in the old house is bound to witness its humans
digging graves for the deceased in compost pits, in which the bodies
would hopefully give life back to earth in the city. Our resident flora
has had no choice but to be a de facto cemetery.
