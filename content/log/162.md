- Added a whole new section, [**Wiki**](/wiki), or my Super Second Brain.
  It contains my notes on many different topics that I'm now making
  semi-public.
- On that note, I added the [Wiki Meta](/wiki-meta) project page to
  briefly outline the implementation (read: hack) of this wiki.
- And other minor edits for aesthetics.

This quick update brings attention to the way the birds chirped and how
they might have sounded serene. But the cage around them and the Urban
Mess beyond has told me that they can be your Muse for _____ pesos only.

# Music

For the month of Jan 2024, these are the albums I listened to.

| Album Name     | Artist        |
|----------------|---------------|
| Nobela         | Join the Club |
| Computer World | Kraftwerk     |
| Kala           | M.I.A.        |

Listen to *Nobela* if: You like your OPM flavored with 2005 alternative
rock that's semi-obscured by the fame of its contemporaries. Underdogs
like Join the Club had been a fave among angsty teenager of that era.

Listen to *Computer World* if: You are almost always breaking out into a
dance number each time you hear an EDM from the 80s, but can't because
you now have aging bones. You swear that their great
track, *Computer Love*, might have been the trigger to wake the sleeper
agent in you.

Listen to *Kala* if: The electronica fuses into hiphop to make that
familiar buzz, and you're not bothered by it. Why would you be? It
sounds catchy and doesn't choke on typical machismo.
