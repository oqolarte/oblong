## Brief review of *Children of Dune*

This is the 3rd book in Dune Saga by Frank Herbert. Took longer than
expected, because honestly, some parts were boring. But I guess they
are necessary for the world-building, especially there are many
scheming characters wanting to take power.

## Hobbies

Another con of having a corpo job is chopping time off from hobbies.
There is a good likelihood that I might be getting back to work early
JAN 2026 and, to be honest, I am not excited about it. But I *must* earn
somehow, right?

## End of the year recap?

No, I don't do that.

But I will say I am grateful for all the things---good and bad---that
happened to me this year, because each one was an opportunity to learn
something about myself and the people closest to me.

## Music

For the month of DIS 2025, these are the albums I listened to:
