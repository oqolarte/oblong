This should prevent others from copying/adapting my work *and then* closing the free flow of information by slapping a different copyright license.
I also removed the icon.
All this nuisance, I hope that it matters.
- Added my CV in the [Index](/), in case a prospective employer wanders in.
- Added new segments to [The Site]({{< ref "/project/site.md" >}})
- Removed the navigation menu. The major sections can be accessed in the Index, and at the end of each Page.

When we visited Isya's Inay[^1] yesterday in Marikina, the lunch was already waiting for us.
Beef pochero did us in, but only enough to go through another helping in the evening's partaking.
More enriching was their rice, imported from Abra up north of Luzon.
I have to know what it's called, so we can scout it from nearby rice suppliers.

We watched Christopher Nolan's *Tenet* after lunch.
Actually, Isya and I had already seen it a few days prior;
we're just rewatching this to hopefully answer some of our questions the movie's convoluted plot.
As you may know, Nolan's films require more than just one viewing.

In fact, Isya and I are planning to watch another Nolan's, *Interstellar*.

[^1]: *Inay* is their term of endearment for their paternal grandmother.
