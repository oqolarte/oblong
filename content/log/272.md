*In which I guide the reader from introversion to public performance*

## Reading and thinking and talking

Currently, I am still reading for fun, because reading is one of the
most accessible hobbies that does not need one to spend a lot.

I pause to pose questions, even without specifics, to no one in
particular: this is how I engage now with the text, by having
pseudo-conversations with the author, with an imagined audience, with
myself, or with all of them.

Thinking passionately muddies the already muddied life. Because logic
and reason are supposed to lead us to Good Life, we
still cannot have nice things in the mundane.

Amid boredom, instead of creating stuff for fun (writing, woodworking,
cooking, etc.) I sometimes opt to dive deeper inward.

Does void attract spice? This travel to the space within is
introspection: curling a healthy blend of tradition passed down to me by
my elders, of developing data from the emerging science and technology,
and of the maturing ethics that sometimes help me discern what's good
and kind based on a given context or setting. When I surface, I hurry to
jot any findings, lest they go up with the big maker, shifting away
beneath the sands of time. Herbert's *Dune* series might have answers,
but I am still finishing Book 1 as of writing.

## Going all out with a[ny] creative endeavor

This morning, while walking the Dog, I remember Spot PH's interview of
Phillip Hernandez, an online comedian, in their piece, "[Davao Conyo: Portrait of an Introvert As Internet Star](https://www.spot.ph/arts-culture/arts-culture-peopleparties/109902/interview-with-content-creator-philip-hernandez-aka-davao-conyo-a5353-20240901-lfrm2?s=t72h78lva56q2fmts5oenfcpaq)".

According to the article, "Upon saving up â‚±100,000 from his content,
[Phillip Hernandez] quit his day job as a home-based virtual assistant,
focused on being a full-time creator, and eventually moved to Manila."

I thought, "What's stopping me from taking a similar risk to follow a
creative pursuit?" It does not have to be performing for the public's
entertainment, although I do not close such opportunities.

The answer, I think, is still in the process of gelling, but the seed
is rooted somewhere in the nature-nurture duality of my---or anyone
else's---upbringing.

## Pretending, performance in Philippine politics

Saving the most boring fluff for last, my reaction on a reaction about
who should be allowed to run for PH Politics.

I disagree that only those with background in law, political science,
and economics whould run for public office. Those three fields offer a
narrow and shallow perspective of what could be the so-called
Philippines.

Ideally, we would not have to put our fate and faith in the hands of few
politicians and so-called justices, but we have to acknowledge that this
is something we are forced to work with (or around).

Qualifications of a would-be public servant should come from diverse
backgrounds, a huge chunk of whome should come from blue-collar working
class. (This recent election, we saw the candidacy of Leody de Guzman,
Ronnel Arambulo, and Danilo Ramos who are labor leader, fisherman, and
farmer respectively, among others.)

If there is one class of people I would personally bar from entering
politics, it would be the actors, celebrities, entertainers and other
similar "careers" whose main job involves charming, performing, and/or playing
make-believe for a huge audience. (Are theater actors counted? Let me
know. And don't forget to smash that LIKE button...)
