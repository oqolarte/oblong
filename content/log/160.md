Night walk with [the dog](/feb2022-photos/#day-17), after spending the
whole daytime glued to the work computer, heals all organs battered by
the Grind. The cool evening provides a nice ambience while the
almost-full moon watches over its constituents. Earlier, on my way home
from office, I couldn't help but "dedicate" the same moon to my partner
when I saw it glowing in the sky. It is but a harmless romantic gesture---the
celestial object belongs to no one and thus cannot be served from one
lover to another.

My companion and I are like the Earth and Moon, always tugging at each
other as the larger of the two guides its partner along a predetermined
path. I should be a responsible human to this dog by teaching it how to
behave properly during walks, e.g., to remain calm, and to walk along or
behind me. And to that, I say what I say to Death: Next time.

On our usual route, we come across a night jogger twice whom, on
both occasions, we witness zig-zagging. Are they increasing their number
of steps without changing their usual route?

Tonight, the miracle is not in the nigh-absence of motorists, but in the
possibility of attaining this Quiet amid the urban mess of ______ City.
When it's like this, don't make me hate it.
