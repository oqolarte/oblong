Greenwashing happens when companies try to solve climate crisis through
public relations, e.g., producing "[sustainable aviation fuel](https://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/sustainable-aviation-fuels-arent-the-answer-flying-less-is/#:%7E:text=Second%2C%20SAF%20are%20misnamed%2C%20as,SAF%20to%20meet%20aviation%20demand)"
to make flying greener, when flying less is the better solution.
Of course, this is a business decision, behind which is the [profit incentive](/capitalism).
