## Intro

Capitalism is, whether we like it or not, a strong idea that most of us
[are coerced to] agree on,
[an elaborate Ponzi scheme](https://crimethinc.com/posters/capitalism-is-a-pyramid-scheme) that shapes our
lives and the space around us, extracting from us to feed
the profit incentive---an endless growth on finite resources which, in
reality, cannot be sustained.

For those against it (AKA the working class), we cosplay
capitalism because we need to get paid to meet our needs.

## Destructive nature of capitalism

Capitalists have always been business-minded people. To them,
profit-incentives are found *especially* in crises: pandemics, natural
disasters brought about by climate change, even loneliness and death.

It has ended so many lives, and yet it is not [our deaths](/death) that
the elite class fear but our lives. Alive, we can be learning and
[kicking to topple the oppression](/direct-action).

When we no longer think of profit as the sole path to growth; when we no
longer sacrifice lives and the environment to "meet this
quarter's/year's quota"; when we, in fact, remove the notion of Profit,
let alone the act of chasing it, then we would be freer.

## According to Marxists...

Marxists believe that [transformation of society](/revolution) will pass
*through* capitalism to transform to socialism and eventually to
communism. It's as if state and capital are willing to shed its power to
make way for something else. In the hundreds of years since Marx(ists)
came up with this shit, history shows us that the powers-that-be retain
its control by status quo.

## Anti-capitalist affirmations

And now, litanies against capitalism.

- I am allowed to spend my time creating things, even if they are not
  beautiful.
- There is [no such thing as a "real job."](/anti-work). All forms of
  work are real and valid.
- There is nothing that I need to accomplish to be worthy. I am already
  worthy.
- Doing nothing is good for my soul.
- I am not defined by what I produce.
- My worth cannot be measured by my paycheck, my job title, or a list of
  professional or academic achievements.
- I do not need to monetize my hobbies. It is enough to spend time doing
  something I love.
- I will not let society decide what success looks like. I can define
  what successful life looks like for me.
