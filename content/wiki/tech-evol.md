The rapid evolution of technology has brought about
significant changes in the way we live, work, and interact with the
world around us. Globalization is, largely, made possible with the
exponential development of tech; and with it came also the globalization
of information, which arguably is one of the best things that happened
since the conception of quantum physics. Internet, specifically, was
dreamed to be the democratization of information, and this, as we know,
would change our lives.

From the early days of mainframe computers to the current era of
artificial intelligence and the internet of things, technology continues
to mold the spaces around us, including our relationships with other
people. In this technological growth, however, ethics has been slow to
keep up, leaving us with privacy and security
concerns, among other things, as an afterthought.

This is a problem. When ethics is not part of the design process, the
resulting tech can and will be used for other, more harmful things.

Never has it been easier for corporations and nation-states to conduct
mass surveillance, especially when it is so beautifully designed and
packaged that we cannot help but jump in and use it, like for example,
social media platforms, or the sleek smart gadgets with which we access
said platforms. These platforms collect our data without our consent!
These data will then be stored in their data centers, to be processed
later for various purposes that we won't even know until it's too late.

Consequently, it is becoming more difficult to opt out of these
"services." Big Tech companies and authoritarian regimes have pushed
back on efforts that preserve citizens' personal privacy and security.
This is intended.

We are here to help. NBTV is replete with explainer and tutorial videos
on how to reclaim our privacy, little by little.

## WHY (Privacy)

We can all have have honest and open conversations with people we care
about within private spaces. Here, privacy means having the choice with
whom to interact and where.

Perhaps one of the bane of social media platforms is that many of them
exploit our need to socialize to encourage oversharing of personal data
to the public. This normalization of oversharing, then, transforms the
need for privacy as *counterproductive*, because somehow, it is becoming
bad when one has "something to hide."

Privacy is often confused with secrecy.

But they are two different things. Secrecy is usually about withholding
information to control where the power flows. Thus, keeping secrets is
not at the foundation of *any* healthy relationships.

### Quick tips

1. Encrypt your data as much as you can when it is being stored at rest.
2. When your data is transiting over the internet, make sure it's also
   encrypted using TLS/SSL.
3. In digital communications, we recommend using messaging apps with
   end-to-end encryption turned on as its default.

## WHY (Security)

Security, as with privacy, is not something one adds on ad hoc.
It has to be included in all stages of development and implementation.

One way to do this is by adopting a security mindset, which
encourages us to think like a would-be threat actor and
identify potential vulnerabilities in the systems around us. This
includes digital systems, but also physical systems, such as our homes
and personal devices. By taking a proactive approach to security, we can
better protect ourselves from potential threats and ensure our privacy
and safety.

Side note: It is also important to remember that there is a range of
abilities that we must keep in mind when designing and implementing
security solutions. Just as privacy and security should be embedded in
every stage of a project, *accessibility* should alse be embedded in
every tech-related solution.

## Rebel against tech?

In the 1990s, Cuba experienced a severe economic crisis that led to
widespread shortages of basic goods and services. In response, Cubans
turned to innovation and creativity to meet their needs, leading to the
emergence of what Ernesto Oroza calls "technological disobedience."
This movement involved the
creation of substitutes for goods that were no longer available, using
whatever materials were at hand. While this movement was driven by
necessity, it also highlights the power of creativity and innovation in
the face of adversity.

In the digital age, technological disobedience can take on a different
form. We don't need to throw away our digital devices; doing so can only
marignally help.

Even the Luddites wanted technology to be deployed in ways that made
work more humane and gave workers more autonomy. Their
goal in smashing the looms was to challenge not the technology itself,
but rather the social relations that governed its use.
In the same vein, what can we do to reject not the technology, but the
harmful effects that arise from when powers-that-be misuse it for their
own gains?

With the rise of the internet and social media, we are
seeing new forms of censorship that are not necessarily overt, but
rather subtle and insidious. As technology continues to evolve, it is
important to remain vigilant about the potential for censorship and
surveillance, and take steps to protect our freedoms.

At the same time, we must be aware that technology is not a panacea for
all our problems. While it can provide solutions to certain challenges,
it is not a substitute for human creativity, ingenuity, and resilience.
This is especially true in the context of complex societal challenges,
such as climate change, biodiversity loss, food insecurity, and poor
energy access. Technology is, to put simply, a set of tools to achieve
goals. The human factor behind and in front of those goals determine its
development and implementation.

As we go through this ever-changing technological landscape, it is
important to maintain a critical perspective and recognize the potential
implications of new technologies. We must be willing to ask tough
questions and engage in thoughtful dialogue about the role of technology
in our society.

We can start small by asking these questions:

1. What privacy-respecting tools and pieces of software can I gradually
   incorporate in my daily life?
2. How can I engage my friends and family to engage in this dialogue?
3. Since not all of us can be "tech-savvy", how can we find people in
   our community to trust and consult with in matters of privacy and
   security in the tech we use?
