## To Edgar

I was mulling about my relatively brief interaction with you, Edgar. I
lit an incense to mark the occasion, and there by your spot in the
garden I staked it. My descent to unnamed pits had begun when my solace
was transmuted to a golden feeling that whispered good memories and
showed me the depths of such bosom and kindness.

Sometimes, Eddie Boy, I think of your silliness and how you were gone
too soon. I have not catered to a huge cast of cats in my life so far,
but no one has come close. Maybe that is an unfair assessment for the
others, but you showed me that love and friendship can be deeper than we
were initially led to believe.

## Household funk

No one can hear the summons of the void but, feel the surrounding parts
maybe. Is this it? This hollow feeling despite the good food, good
company. The emptiness is neither harmful event nor is it anything
really other than that---blank space, no mind of its own, without doubt
and sinister. Yet here we are. Trying to make sense of what is or is
not. In addressing we arrive at a grey area, something tangible that we
can accept for now, because it definitely is much better than the
"chicken mami" without the chicken!

This funk reminds me of that Valentine's day from 2019.

## Valentine's day, 2019

From the drafts:

With a slew of terrible things happening today, partly because of me,
mostly because of the world around me (of course!), I have been feeling
down for the most part of the day, with sad tears even.

I hope I didn't put that lightly for the future readers of this note; I
am capital-T *Truly* down. I would've said Depressed, but I'm not
qualified to diagnose myself as such.

I'd like to hope for better days ahead, but the days ahead include the
midterm elections,[^elect] and we know we Filipinos are about to get drilled
again by [those in power and/or capable now of purchasing it](/empire).

Happy Valentine's Day...

[^elect]: Timely coincidence! So-called Philippines will have another
[midterm election this coming May 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Philippine_general_election).
