Ruminating on one's past life often leaves a mix of tastes on one's
palette, yet here I am, unafraid to make such revisits from time to
time.

## Fave color

I vaguely remember the striking feeling that yellow allowed me to
experience when I was a kid, but the soft thud remains in the back
of my mind. It is a happy color, then and now, to me. While the
minute details have long since vanished, the positive feeling is
something I could still see from afar.

Yellow, I was told back then, [was not exactly a "boy's color"](/patriarchy).
So, I had to look around and pick another one.
I did not know the implications of
this; however, this was one of my earliest memories of gender norms.

"Girls should only be X; boys should only be Y." All predetermined by
that organ between their legs.

Though simple-sounding, that quote was a big concept for me to grasp.
But the adults in my life, both men and women, continued to hammer down
what they believed to be the do's and don'ts of each gender to every
young person within their sphere of influence. And their truths
mattered. These adults had made sure to never verbally say something
obviously wrong about me. But it was their actions that made the
most impact on me. Something about actions being louder than words.

However, what comprises boy's colors, no one could truly say. A close
relative's favorite color is green. He drinks too much alcohol for his
own good. Is green a boy's color? Is drinking alcohol the pathway to
manhood? Perhaps self-destruction?

Another relative, his favorite color is blue. He is a proud smart,
sensitive, gay man who has accomplished many things. Where, then, along
the binary of boy-girl does that put blue?

## Courage

Not too far along the color wheel---and having a small palette as a
kid---I found red. With it came big ideas like courage, anger, blood.
*Boy's stuff*, finally.

Not too long after that, I encountered the cartoon show
*Courage the Cowardly Dog*. Despite some of the episodes being too jarring and
out-there for my young sensibilities, I came to enjoy the series. Most
of the time it was wacky in a fun and weird way. It even had feel-good
endings for many episodes, imparting moral lessons right after it scared
my guts into knots.

The titular Courage was not red, but a shade of purple. He was *cowardly*,
yes, but do we not all need fear to do the brave "things we do for
love"?

Some time later, though, I asked myself whether the creators of the show
intended to showcase something deeper in that quote. Are we not also
wont to do stupid things because of love? Or is it even love if one is
already acting stupid for it?

Also, going back---where in the gender spectrum, then, does that put the color
purple? And can one big idea inhabit two colors on the wheel?

## Box of crayons

As a kid from the lower-middle class (if we are to believe that the
entire middle class does exist, and having a gradient at that), I was
only exposed to the cheap eight-crayon box of Crayola, as it was the
only coloring tool we could afford. Imagine, then, the awe I felt
when a gracious distant aunt gifted us the 64-crayon box. All these
colors with funny and exciting labels: peach, lime green, flesh,
magenta, maroon. Who knew fruits other than orange can be a color name?

Going back to Courage, he would be a *star apple* if we are going with
this.

Did I need a bigger box of crayons to expand my palette? What I could
confidently say is, it helped me understand the visual details around
me. Expanding the palette necessitated the expansion of vocabulary; and
with more words to experience the world, I was able to build more
relationships with Nature, both physically and spiritually, whether I
knew it at time. Remembering people and things and ideas consist of
knowing, or sometimes, assigning labels to them.

## Noise-talgia

[THEN, A PIERCING SOUND. CUT TO SILENCE. THEN, A LOW HUM.]

Entropy of human brain only adds corrugation to memories. They belong to
the brown noise of past---calming, yes, but at some point, I would need
to return to the present. To deal with Real matters of being an adult.
Before that, though, let me just hit that sweet, sweet drug. Nostalgia.

Up until this point, I have taken you a long winding trip down *my*
memory lane, and while I have no idea what its effect is on you, it
certainly made me feel things again. But there are gaps, of course. With
which I filled with, what, a hyper-real version of what used to be? Is
that reliable?

The thing with nostalgia is that, it does not need to be reliable. The
general shape of a memory need not have the perfect details remembered
in order to feel good.

And the general shape could take on a sonic wave, even in the form of a
emo punk band from your teens. Mark Joseph Stern in his essay, "[Neural Nostalgia](https://slate.com/technology/2014/08/musical-nostalgia-the-psychology-and-neuroscience-for-song-preference-and-the-reminiscence-bump.html),"
he notes how music from our teens hits differently.

Perhaps producers exploit this phenomenon and bank on the idea that if
they make good enough muzak that it hits the right kind of youth, they
are set for life.

This is why Air Supply can be confident that they will fill the
Philippine Arena *when* they tour here. The same reason why My Chemical
Romance is now on World Tour as of writing; and they are set to perform
in the Philippine Arena on APRIL 2026. I doubt that the expensive
tickets will deter nostal-junkies from wanting that sweet, sweet drug
that their nervous systems both seek and receive.

As we navigate both possible and real experiences, we
eventually grow tired and find wanting to rest, where our subconscious
resists reality.

## Sleep consolidated

Our last stop before waking up is none other than the realm of sleep.
A sanctuary suspended in time where body recuperates and mind develops
dreams.

The palette of dreams is muted as though boxed by the limited palette
from childhood. But the plots make up for it as things are always absurd
and bombastic, likely drawing from a growing library of experience and
emotions I have already gone through.

I remember having a different gender in one of them while engaging in
something I will not do even when wide awake. Is there a color for
that, for shifting genders? Perhaps a glowing snow like opal, but the
colors of the non-binary flag might also work.

In dreams, I am both liberated by my imagination yet caged by my
inability to move, to run, to swim. It does not help when I am being
chased by something. And often, something chases me, perhaps a real-life
fear morphing into blinding white, formless phobia that goes
after me.

When I wake up, there is a reversal: I am now able to move freely, but
my mind rarely has the time to dream of possibilities, because the
present demands my attention. Hunger demands to be satiated. Thirst
demands to be quenched. Coming back up---into adulthood---is a long list of
demands for which different palettes must rotate to animate it according
to the one you envisioned.

## I am an Adult Now

Now as an adult, I do not know what my favorite color is. I am not sure
if it is still red, or a specific shade of red. If my small wardrobe is
any indication, I am drawn nowadays to dark colors, mostly black, not
because I have grown villainous towards the world around me, but mostly
because I find black... the right amount of worldliness and humility, if
that makes sense.

> Black says this: “I don’t bother you - don’t bother me.”
> 
> Yohji Yamamoto

But, sometimes, I want you to bother me, especially if the intention is
to build something new that's bigger than both of us combined. We as
adults should always learn from the past, as if it were prophecy for the
things to come. I am still drawn to vivid palettes: artworks that come
alive with contrasting hues tightroping between hope and nihilism;
cinematography with impossible yet lively color grading; radical designs
that surprise you with the right pop of maddened color, etc. Age graces
one with a certain appreciation for depth more than breadth.

1. Transitions Between Sections: Consider adding transitional phrases at
   the end of each section to create a smoother connection to the next
   topic. For example, after discussing colors, you could mention how
   these colors relate to emotions or experiences, leading into the
   "Courage" section.
1. Thematic Consistency: Ensure that each section ties back to the
   overarching theme of identity and self-discovery. This could involve
   revisiting the idea of colors as metaphors for emotions or
   experiences in subsequent sections.
1. Repetition for Emphasis: Reiterate key phrases or ideas throughout
   the text to create a sense of cohesion. For instance, the concept of
   "palette" could be revisited in various contexts to reinforce the
   metaphor of personal growth and exploration.
1. Parallel Structure: Use parallel sentence structures when listing
   ideas or experiences to enhance readability and rhythm. This can make
   the text more engaging and easier to follow.
1. Concluding Thoughts: Each section could benefit from a brief
   concluding thought that encapsulates the main idea before
   transitioning to the next topic. This would help reinforce the
   message and provide a natural segue into the following section.
