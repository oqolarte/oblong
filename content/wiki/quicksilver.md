It was supposed to be a flashbang of a love scene. However, the moment
we were in it, it had to unfold according to *our* patience. This familiar
room would be here to absorb every frame as it flipped through the next.
What was the rush all about anyway?

We took our time approaching the edge, even skirting it for as long as
needed.

By all metrics, this happened shorter than the other times. Even so, we
were in no hurry to compare it to past lives. But, yes, we arrived at
the same colors (amber and cream) and sounds (grunts staccato).

We only had the afterglow within which to bask, our skins seemingly
soluble in it (*init*, innit?), before our stoic selves surfaced again
to remind us we are all in one big fucking tribulation.

The aftertaste of this escape to Thrill did not roll on tongue as sweet
as we hoped, when the upheavals happening beyond the room were
mercury retrograde spiraling out of control. But I know we will not give
up. Because how can we when everyone will never?
