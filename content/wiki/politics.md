When we believe that politics is everyday, and not just limited to a
specific time, place, and context, the personal becomes political.
Indeed, the political is personal. We can only oppose what we believe.

I don't necessarily endorse nor condone any of the things found in these
pages. But they are here as reference from which to learn. I leave it to
the reader to discern which "side" of history I am in.
