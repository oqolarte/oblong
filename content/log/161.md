- Edited PDF in [CV](/cv).
- Edited some lines in [Site](/site). More specifically, this site now
  contains---*drumroll*---JavaScript to render some maths. For example, this is the standard form of quadratic equation: \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \)

## Math Typesetting

Just this week, I was looking for ways to incorporate math typesetting
in this blog, and the result of that search are the following links,
shared here for those who are interested:

- [jqmath](https://mathscribe.com/author/jqmath.html) is a JavaScript
  module that "makes it easy to put formatted mathematical expressions
  in web pages."
- [katex](https://katex.org/) is a fast math typesetting library, poised
  to be an alternative to [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/), another popular math typesetting JS.
    - Here is a [simple guide to using katex](https://www.sixthform.info/katex/guide.html)
- [AsciiMath](https://asciimath.org/) is another "easy-to-write" markup
  language for mathematics. But if I'm understanding the current
  documentation correctly, it works only in Firefox and Safari as of
  writing this.
- Thomas Lochmatter maintains this [LaTeX to SVG](https://viereck.ch/latex-to-svg/index.html) web app for converting math LaTeX equation to a SVG---useful for sharing image-based math formulas.

I may not need these at all due to [recent updates on Hugo v0.122.0](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.122.0),
which highlights LaTeX typesetting directly from Markdown.

A possible alternative I might explore in the future is to implement Joe
Mooring's way of converting math expressions to SVG as discussed in his
article [Mathematical expressions](https://www.veriphor.com/articles/mathematical-expressions/).

## Done with *Applied Cryptography Specialization*

Over a month ago, I publicly announced that I was
[dipping toes in cryptography](/148/#dipping-toes-in-crypto) as a form
of accountability.

After weeks of on-and-off self-studying, I'm glad to share that I have
now completed the program, and with it, a new certification:
**Introduction to Applied Cryptography Specialization from University of
Colorado System**! Click here to view [my credential via Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/VDBCUULAG5FR).

Thanks to the instructors of the program, William Bahn, Richard White,
and Sang-Yoon Chang for making this Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) available.

## Parking issue in our neighborhood

We recently attended a meeting with the homeowners' association, and the
agenda was about parking slots. In a middle-class neighborhood where
residents have disposable income to avail their own car but not their
own garage, the common street that we all share quickly clogs up with
death machines. The heat escalates when people think they own the
parking slot in front of their house, but other car owners use it
because, they would argue, "it's public property."

The meeting attempted to address this issue. Without an experienced
facilitator, though, the [non?]discussion took longer than expected. Others
walked out; many, including us, stayed, hoping to have a resolution.

After hours of meandering talk, the resolution is a *nuanced* status
quo, but status quo nonetheless. Yes, you read that right. I won't
bother you with more boring details, though.

In all the animated discussion, the topic of pedestrian welfare and how
they---we---are affected by this parking issue was not brought up. The
streets are not "meant for cars alone" contrary to what many people
believe. It is a public space shared by all, and pedestrians shouldn't have
to jaywalk in and around vehicles, stationary or otherwise, in stupidly
dangerous 30-kph residential streets, to get to their destinations safely.
