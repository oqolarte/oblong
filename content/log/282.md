## Brief review of *The Vegetarian*

A horror story about abusive relationships running deep in Korean
societies, Han Kang manages to explore that in a prose that by barely
evoking emotions, actually demands more from the reader to feel
something for the characters.

It is hard not to sympathize with the victims of Korea's culture of
abuse and misogyny, and how this deadly mix continues to hurt, even
*breed* damaged people. These are toxic traits that have been wiped
clean from K-Pop and K-Dramas before being exported for global
consumption.

Moreover, the novel is about how we cannot fully understand another
person and their choices. This is just my own interpretation, though.
The author herself said in "[Han Kang on Violence, Beauty, and the (Im)possibility of Innocence](https://lithub.com/han-kang-on-violence-beauty-and-the-impossibility-of-innocence/)", a conversation between herself and
Bethanne Patrick, that *The Vegetarian* is "not a
singular indictment of the Korean patriarchy."

## Brief review of *Dune Messiah*

A short book about the "downfall" of Paul Atreides, many years into
being an Emperor. But is it really a downfall if it is caused by both
conspiracy (external) and choice (internal)?

Frank Herbert questioned in this book how we view the Man whose
so-called greatness was the result of our own myth-making.

## Finally, jovial

Does shock ever set in when it comes to dealing with death? I do not
know. But in the [eternal repose of someone](/281) you used to care about, it
does leave a void where a familiar feeling once resided.

*Pagpag* becomes an act of self-care aside from forcing the grieving and
convincing the dead to not tag along homeward. And it takes on many
forms:

- Enjoying the transitions between modes of transportation;
- Catching up with families and friends over thin-crust pizza, mediocre
  pasta, and smelly fried chicken;
- Walking under light rain; and
- Singing the hearts out over at videoke for *at least* five hours,
  closing off with the obligatory *That's what friends our for* by
  Dionne Warwick et al.
