Different ways of existing together and living in relative harmony are
already present in many communities all around the world. To gain sight
of them, we must be open, and
[actively look for empowering ways](/joyful-militancy),
that despite our differences, we can live
together.

## Living together with differences

What are we capable of doing individually? Collectively? We won't know
until we try and try again.

It won't be easy. People naturally have different experiences
that may clash with other perspectives. Working well within the
community means working with these differences, facing them head on
whenever possible instead of avoiding them altogether. This means a lot
meeting halfway, and a lot of making compromises between all parties
involved.

It's okay to not have good relationships with everyone. We are trying to
avoid the simplistic hegemony applied to us by Empire. It's important to
have conflict with others and possibly learn from all the ways we can
resolve them in the spaces we inhabit.

To make meaningful compromises that empower those affected,
it's helpful for oneself to be open to a myriad of experiences and
different perspectives. If it's in one's capacity to try everything at
least once, then one should do it. One of the main reasons why people
don't like compromises is because of fear. Perhaps, by living fully
might we slowly chip away at our fears, and/or use them as tools with
which we can strengthen our [relationships](/friendship).

### "But I don't need anyone!"

Yes, you do. I do. **I** am already a crowd because my life already
depends on others.

Can individuals make a difference? Together we can, in a way that
matters, in our communities---volunteer, [teach](/pedagogy), pick up
trash if it isn't in a bin, etc. While we must [gradually] accept that
these things might not be enough to stop or slow the broader
[collapse](/collapse), random acts of kindness matter for the person
(both humans and non-humans) and plants that you helped to overcome an
obstacle.

Neoliberal individualism "empowers" a person to be responsible for their
own success, to keep themselves healthy mentally, physically, and
emotionally. In reality, Empire [markets](/mr) this individualism as
"empowering" and of course we latch onto this so-called powers granted
to us, because it only makes us dependent on its systems. It strips away
our ability to imagine for collective alternatives.

Always doubt anyone who thinks they don't need other people to live.
They might have anti-social and/or sociopathic tendencies. Living alone,
by oneself, is literally impossible.

## Past and future communities

Consider: we may have affected both our ancestors and our descendants by
existing now. On one hand, the former had thought about our welfare and
acter accordingly; on another, we could be doing the same for the
latter. Community work, then, like many [revolutionary](/revolution) acts, spans generations.
