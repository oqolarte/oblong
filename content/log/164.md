- Edited intro in [Imbentori](/imbentori).
- And other minor design edits.

Long weekend---and for that I have the Chinese New Year to thank.
Shouldn't a typical weekend last *at least* 3 whole days? It would be
nice to have a whole day for chores, a whole day for personal matters
and/or rest, and a whole day dedicated for families and friends.

And I'm grateful for [having friends](/friendship), wherever, whenever they are,
because they make me a better version of myself. I can only hope I'm
doing the same for them.

Sometimes, though, I hurt people, which would happen less if I were being
sensitive to my own grit. Even if I don't intend to, it happens. Part of
growing as a person is recognizing when it does, and owning up to it.
