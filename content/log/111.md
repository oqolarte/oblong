It's been a week now since we've arrived from Negros,
back to the cityscape of the dizzying Metro Manila.
I didn't almost notice the difference in the air quality between the two places:
in the suburban of Negros, people burn their dried leaves with the day's trash;
here in Manila, the pollution comes mostly from roaring cars and trucks.

But to Negros's credit, their air is definitely cleaner in general than Manila's.

I look out the windows, and there's no mountain in the distance.
Unlike in Negros, where Mount Talinis won't ever
offend anyone with its humble beauty.

I wonder:

When all your life you've lived near a mountain,
do you eventually take it for granted?
Do you wake up some days and not notice it?

As a tourist from Manila,
I nod in awe seeing any mountain looming *over there*,
atmoshphere refracting it to a hint bluish haze.
