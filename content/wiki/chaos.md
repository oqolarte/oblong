## Anti-thesis to perfection

Perfection is a human-centric concept. We're constantly shaping the
world we live in so that it fits our tastes as close as possible.
Whatever this state looks like, achieving it is expensive and requires a
lot of resources.

On the other hand, nature is irregular and "perfectly" functions that
way. Must we burn through nature so that we have it fit to our needs, or
do we work in tandem with it, riffing impromp-tunes in our own unique
ways to make melody for everyone involved? If you don't mind, I prefer
the latter.

## Alongside entropy

It is nice to know that apart from the on-going churn of entropy, there
are pockets and ponds that become more "[eutrophic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutrophication)"
(more nutrient-rich) along with it---signs of life.

## Randomness

> Time wounds all heels.

Randomness is especially useful in [cryptography](/cryptography), and
some sources in Nature include:

- radioactive decay
- [motion of fluids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavarand)
- [atmospheric noise](https://www.random.org/)
- pulsars
