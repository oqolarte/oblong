Slow productivity tackles meaningful work sustained over a long period
so as to avoid exhaustion and/or burnout.

[Meaningful changes](/revolution) don't necessarily happen overnight,
so might as well
embrace Time and factor it in the work we our doing (or not doing).

## Slow Tech

Our strides in [technology](/technology) lead many of us believe that
solving certain problems must be quick now, or else, what's the point?

Someone who stayed in our home snarked on our manual coffee grinder,
visibly being sarcastic about how it's slow living in the Major Urban
City. Maybe it's lost on them that even if we can obtain a high-speed
grinder, we have chosen to be intentional in some of our
tasks, including making a cup of coffee. At the end of the day, though
worlds apart, caffeine is the
[ansible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansible) that united us, so all cool.
