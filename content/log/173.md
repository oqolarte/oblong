## Farewell, Lola Mila

Lola Milagros Olarte (LM) passed away this week, at the age of 88.
As with most things suddenly occurring, shock came in spurts---manageable,
almost transactional. It's odd to put it that way, but this is true
because I have been growing away from the matriarch.

She wasn't the kindest abuela there ever was to say the least. Like many
people of her time, she had a lot of unresolved trauma brought about by
wars and abuses: as local as her blood family and as societal as the
political landscape that came and went. Hurt people hurt people, we
know, despite them having religiously read during their lifetime the
Holy Scripture. Sadly, LM had reproduced the harm she experienced, and
the people closest to her were the most affected.

I personally am a receiver of her physical abuse, an unwanted core
memory that's nigh impossible to delete, even after all these years.
To forgive, I won't forget.

Time wounds all heels, i.e, entropy's idea at the back of mind empowers
anyone to realize that everything will be delivered to it. Random
vagueness is the end state of the void, and that none of the hurt now
will matter then. So why not focus on other things?

The last mass for LM felt rushed. Very few songs were played and sang. I
give the priest's homily 2 hostias out of 10: it lacked the wisdom and
the ferocity that LM had. Mourners weren't given their moments to say
their last words to the departed, although I'm not sure whether doing so
is a "proper" Catholic way. *If* such segment were there, I'd dedicate
the 2nd paragraph of this post to LM.

## Losing wits?

Something seems to be happening to me.

No other way to put it: I feel I'm getting dumber.

Is this the effect of all the bad things happening around the world? Is
this the air quality and the noise pollution of urban cities that I am
absorbing everyday? Is this the heat that slow-cooks my flesh and
nerves? When annihilation arrives, do I use the last dregs of energy to fuck
things up and find out if interesting things would bloom?

During the bereavement, someone close to me reprimanded me to stop
intellectualizing things like my emotions when I should be feeling them
first, before anything else. I agree---but how can I do that when many
times, there's just static up there? That, and the squishy primordial soup
that misinterprets scents as stolen memories.

## Playing small

Why does "playing small" have to be framed poorly?
Playing small, if anything, is more sustainable in the long run:
anything that's worth doing is worth doing, no matter the pace and scale.
Don't let some entrepreneurial fake guru and/or some conservative
politician tell you otherwise.

It's okay to feel contented in solving small [daily] problems without
profit incentive. It's okay to do small deeds. These small things are
what actually maintain the joy in humanity.
