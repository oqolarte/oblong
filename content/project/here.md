For the month of May 2022,
I'll attempt to get to know more where I currently am.[^home]

Inspired by Kevin Kelly's [The Big Here Quiz](https://kk.org/thetechnium/the-big-here-quiz/),[^quiz]
which in turn is inspired by Peter Warshall,
naturalist extraordinaire.

Some questions are modified to fit the context that is the Philippine
archipelago.

[^home]: This doesn't necessarily mean I'll be mentioning the exact address of
  where I currently am.
[^quiz]: I won't be taking this as a quiz,
but will conduct a research for each item.
So, this will definitely be an internet-assisted effort.

## Trace the water you drink from rainfall to your tap.

Our drinking water comes from [La Mesa Dam and reservoir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Mesa_Dam_and_Reservoir).
When water level reaches the max of 80 meters,
particularly during heavy rains and typhoon,
water spills into Tullahan River
which transports the water to Manila Bay.

Manila Water Company Inc. is the private concessionaire that supplies our water.

## When you flush, where do the solids go? What happens to the waste water?

The solid waste goes to East Avenue Sewage Treatment Plant (STP),
which is being operated by Manila Water Company, Inc.

The STP treats collected wastewater from households
(and other establishments)
to remove contaminants before it is released into the environment.

## How many feet (meters) above sea level are you?

According to [this website](https://whatismyelevation.com/),

## How far do you have to travel before you reach a different watershed? Can you draw the boundaries of yours?

The next nearest watershed is Ipo Watershed,
roughly ~40 kilometers out of the National Capital Region.

## Is the soil under your feet, more clay, sand, rock or silt?

Tuff[^tuff] is what's beneath me.
It's a product of on site weathering of pyroclastic materials with high silt content in sandy soils and contains a few silty clay soil.
