- Added [robots.txt](/robots.txt) file to limit crawlers.

## On crawlers crawling

I have recently learned from [Wouter's post](https://brainbaking.com/post/2023/04/is-your-website-training-ai/)
that there's a non-trivial possibility that personal sites like this
one
are training AI,
unbeknown to their owners.

To counter this, I have added a `robots.txt` which you can see in the
linked file above.
This (dis)allows certain site crawlers from getting data in this site.
If you have your own personal site,
consider adding this file to yours.

As of writing this, this site `ohio.araw.xyz` is [*not*](https://c4-search.apps.allenai.org/?q=ohio.araw.xyz) in Google's C4
dataset.

## On hypocrisy and spirituality

Do you agree that we are all hypocrites?

I think so.

I think it's part flaw, part gift as a complex person
in this ever-changing society.
Some are just more so than others.

But I'm especially wary of hyper-religious people,
because 99.99% of the time,
they are the worst kinds of hypocrites.

It's not easy to catch yourself,
but self-awareness can be learned through practice and experience.
Extremely religious people might find it harder, though,
because they tend to be blinded by their faith.
I would say, "It's fine to not know everything,"
but they would get back at me with some weird line like
"But my deity can and will help me."

I get it, really:
we need to *believe* in something.
I just think there's more nuance to that.

Misery keeps us down only because we're helpless to break out
of the concepts that we allow to run in our lives.
Is this why many of us look for comfort somewhere else,
somewhen that isn't necessarily tangible, but the literature of which
soothes the spirit somehow?
I get that, really.
