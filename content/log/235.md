I exist again in a more familiar space after a short break spent in Baguio City
before peak season hit.

Here, where I write these words, I am reminded that warmer weather
definitely affects people's behavior. When I returned here, I also
returned to a grumpier self who loses hard to all the subconscious
fights before I'm even aware of them. That same self, in a funny turn of
events, forgot to bring the essentials for this very trip. Good thing
that forgetfulness rarely ruins vacations... to wit!

I am not one of those who annually goes to Baguio. If I had to estimate,
I am only there, on average, every 5 years, each time being a bit more
shocking than the previous one in terms of witnessing the changes.

During my short stay there, I have also observed the following when
participating in the city's transportation network:

1. **Motorists yield to pedestrians.** I'm sure this happens elsewhere,
   but certainly not as much here in Metro Manila. Drivers in Baguio
   prioritize pedestrians by giving them all the time and
   space they need when crossing the streets. Despite the narrow
   sidewalks in many---and even nonexistent in some---streets, knowing
   this makes the city more walkable, even if its topography can be
   unforgiving to plains people like me.
2. **Drivers give way to other drivers.** The steep slopes, combined
   with sharp turns, can be challenging, even for seasoned drivers.
   That's why it's common courtesy among local drivers to give way to
   the other guy whenever possible. This is refreshing to witness for me
   who has mostly known the Metro Manila's aggressive, angry, and
   reckless drivers. Of whom I am again reminded getting back here.

I still consider myself a city dweller who needs his daily microdose of
urban white noise. While Baguio is not perfect, its urbanity plus the
cooler climate is what makes it popular. However, I have long since
crossed out the city in my list of possible places where I would settle
for good, if at all. This is out of respect to its citizens, those who
have always been there through its ups and downs. I'm sure they don't
need another person from Metro Manila romanticizing their place with
rose-colored glass.
