Quality sleeps are far and few in between.

I keep hearing loud thuds in the middle of the night.
Sometimes, it's the neighborhood cats jumping onto the hollow roofings.
Sometimes, it's duhats (*Syzygium cumini*) rainfalling from the backyard tree.
In any case,
the thuds agitate the dog,
sending him into barking spree---in the middle of the night,
mind you---until he is satisfied that there is no danger at all...
until the next loud thud, that is.

Sometimes, it's me that the loud thuds agitate.
There were nights that I imagined that someone could be lurking
above us,
waiting to burglarize our home,
if it weren't for the misplaced step that revealed their presence.
