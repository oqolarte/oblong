Vulnerability assessments are internal reviews of an organization's
[security systems](/security) to identify and fix weaknesses; and the
insights gleaned from that will be used to design defense strategies,
which in turn will be evaluated by using [penetration testing](/pen-test).

[Vulnerability scanning tools](/vulnerability-scanning) are commonly used to simulate threats by
finding vulnerabilities in an attack surface.

## Steps in assessment

1. **Identification**: scanning tools and manual testing are used to
   find vulnerabilities. During this step, the goal is to understand the
   current state of a security system, like taking a picture of it. A
   large number of findings usually appear after identification.
2. **Vulnerability analysis**: each of the vulnerabilities that were
   identified are tested. The goal of is to find the source of the
   problem.
3. **Risk assessment**: A score is assigned to each vulnerability. This
   score is assigned based on two factors: how severe the impact would
   be if the vulnerability were to be exploited and the likelihood of
   this happening. Vulnerabilities uncovered during the first two steps
   of this process often outnumber the people available to fix them.
   Risk assessments are a way of prioritizing resources to handle the
   vulnerabilities that need to be addressed based on their score.
4. **Remediation**: Here, the vulnerabilities that can impact the
   organization are addressed. Remediation occurs depending on the
   severity score assigned during the risk assessment step. This part of
   the process is normally a joint effort between the security staff and
   IT teams to come up with the best approach to fixing the
   vulnerabilities that were uncovered earlier. Examples of remediation
   steps might include things like enforcing new security procedures,
   updating operating systems, or implementing system patches.

## Importance of updates

For consumers, updates provide improvements to performance, stability,
and even new features. But from a security standpoint, they serve a
specific purpose. Updates allow organizations to address security
vulnerabilities that can place their users, devices, and networks at
risk. They usually take place after a vulnerability assessment, which is
the internal review process of an organization's security systems.

An outdated [computer](/computer) is a lot like a house with unlocked
doors. Malicious actors use these gaps in security the same way, to gain
unauthorized access. Software updates are similar to locking the doors
to keep them out.

A **patch update** is a software and operating system update that
addresses security vulnerabilities within a program or product. Patches
usually contain bug fixes that address common security vulnerabilities
and exposures.

**Note**: Ideally, patches address common vulnerabilities and exposures
before [malicious hackers](/threat-actor) find them.
However, patches are sometimes
developed as a result of a zero-day.

## Approach cybersecurity with an attacker mindset

To be prepared, we must anticipate changes. In
[cybersecurity](/cybersecurity), this might mean evaluating the findings
of a vulnerability assessment by analyzing them from the persepective of
an attacker.

### Being prepared for anything

In this field, teams often conduct simulations of things that can go
wrong as part of their vulnerability management strategy. Applying an
attacker mindset is a lot like conducting an experiment. It's about
causing problems in a controlled environment and evaluating the outcome
to gain insights. Adopting an attacker mindset is a beneficial skill in
security because it offers a different perspective about the challenges
you're trying to solve.

### Simulating threats

One method of applying an attacker mindset is using attack simulations.
These activities are normally performed in one of two ways:
*proactively* and *reactively*.

- *Proactive simulations* assume the role of an attacker by exploiting
  vulnerabilities and breaking through defenses. This is sometimes
  called a red team exercise.
- *Reactive simulations* assume the role of a defender responding to an
  attack. This is sometimes called a blue team exercise.

Red teams tend to spend more time planning their attacks than performing
them. If you find yourself engaged in one of these exercises, your team
will likely deploy a range of tactics. For example, they might persuade
staff into disclosing their login credentials using fictitious emails to
evaluate security awareness at the company.

On the other hand, blue teams dedicate their efforts to gathering
information about the assets they're protecting. This is commonly done
with the assistance of vulnerability scanning tools.

### Finding innovative solutions

Many [security controls](/security-controls) were created as a reactive
response to risks. Thatâ€™s because criminals are continually looking for
ways to bypass existing defenses. Effectively applying an attacker
mindset will require you to stay knowledgeable of security trends and
emerging technologies.

**Pro tip**: Resources like
[NISTs National Vulnerability Database (NVD)](https://nvd.nist.gov/)
can help you remain current on common vulnerabilities.
