Humans are naturally trusting and emotional, nothing wrong with that. On
top of that, [the current systems in place](/empire) also have made sure
that we are conditioned to respect authority. Bad actors exploit these
and use social engineering to get what they want, usually a piece of
information like a password, by manipulating your emotions through
[communication](/communication) to gain something: a private
information, access, or valuables.

## How?

One of the highest-profile social engineering attacks that occurred in
recent years was the [Twitter Hack of 2020](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/Twitter_Report).
During that incident, a
group of hackers made phone calls to Twitter employees pretending to be
from the IT department. Using this basic scam, the group managed to gain
access to the organization’s network and internal tools. This allowed
them to take over the accounts of high-profile users, including
politicians, celebrities, and entrepreneurs.

[Attackers](/threat-actor) also exploit the fact that more and more
people are choosing convenience over [privacy](/privacy) and
[security](/security). This shift in preference may lead to increased
vulnerability, if people do not examine the tools or services they are
using well enough.

### Examples

Social engineering can be done in a number of ways,
and the list below is non-exhaustive:

1. Emails containing links to malicious sites mimicking the look and
   feel of it, like banking sites.
2. Phone calls in which the caller would pretend to be a legitimate
   employee (e.g., a technician or service agent) of a well-known company.
3. SMS (text messages) containing links to malicious sites
4. Shoulder-surfing, or someone looking over the shoulder of another
   when the latter is doing important stuff on their device, like
   inputting a password or PIN
5. Social media phishing: A threat actor collects detailed information
   about their target from social media sites. Then, they initiate an
   attack.
6. Watering hole attack: A threat actor attacks a website frequently
   visited by a specific group of users.
7. USB baiting: A threat actor strategically leaves a malware USB stick
   for a curious employee to find and install, to unknowingly infect a
   [network](/network). The [Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) provides some security tips](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/using-caution-usb-drives)
   on using caution with USB drives.
, including keeping personal and business drives separate.
8. Physical social engineering: A threat actor impersonates an employee,
   customer, or vendor to obtain unauthorized access to a physical
   location.
9. *Quid pro quo* is a type of baiting used to trick someone into
   believing that they’ll be rewarded in return for sharing access,
   information, or money. For example, an attacker might impersonate a
   loan officer at a bank and call customers offering them a lower
   interest rate on their credit card. They'll tell the customers that
   they simply need to provide their account details to claim the deal.
10. Tailgating is a social engineering tactic in which unauthorized
    people follow an authorized person into a restricted area. This
    technique is also sometimes referred to as piggybacking.
11. [Elicitation](https://christina-lekati.medium.com/elicitation-techniques-74be36e212f8) (*"Well, I'm not supposed to share this but..."*) that leads a person to volunteer information, usually sensitive and/or important.

## Phishing

Phishing is one of the most common types of social engineering, which
are manipulation techniques that exploit human error to gain private
information, access, or valuables.

### The origins of phishing

Phishing has been around since the early days of the
[internet](/internet). It can be traced back to the 1990s. At the time,
people across the world were coming online for the first time. As the
internet became more accessible it began to attract the attention of
malicious actors. These malicious actors realized that the internet gave
them a level of anonymity to commit their crimes.

### Early persuasion tactics

One of the earliest instances of phishing was aimed at a popular chat
service called AOL Instant Messenger (AIM). Users of the service began
receiving emails asking them to verify their accounts or provide
personal billing information. The users were unaware that these messages
were sent by malicious actors pretending to be service providers.

This was one of the first examples of mass phishing, which describes
attacks that send malicious emails out to a large number of people,
increasing the likelihood of baiting someone into the trap.

During the AIM attacks, malicious actors carefully crafted emails that
appeared to come directly from AOL. The messages used official logos,
colors, and fonts to trick unsuspecting users into sharing their
information and account details.

Attackers used the stolen information to create fraudulent AOL accounts
they could use to carry out other crimes anonymously. AOL was forced to
adapt their security policies to address these threats. The chat service
began including messages on their platforms to warn users about phishing
attacks.

### How phishing has evolved

Phishing continued evolving at the turn of the century as businesses and
newer technologies began entering the digital landscape. In the early
2000s, e-commerce and online payment systems started to become popular
alternatives to traditional marketplaces. The introduction of online
transactions presented new opportunities for attackers to commit crimes.

Since the early days of phishing, email attacks remain the most common
types that are used. While they were originally used to trick people
into sharing access credentials and credit card information, email
phishing became a popular method to infect computer systems and networks
with malicious software.

In late 2003, attackers around the world created fraudulent websites
that resembled businesses like eBay and PayPal™. Mass phishing campaigns
to distribute malicious programs were also launched against e-commerce
and banking sites.

### Recent trends

Starting in the 2010s, attackers began to shift away from mass phishing
attempts that relied on baiting unsuspecting people into a trap.
Leveraging new technologies, criminals began carrying out what’s known
as targeted phishing attempts. Targeted phishing describes attacks that
are sent to specific targets using highly customized methods to create a
strong sense of familiarity.

A type of targeted phishing that evolved in the 2010s is angler
phishing. **Angler phishing** is a technique where attackers impersonate
customer service representatives on social media. This tactic evolved
from people’s tendency to complain about businesses online. Threat
actors intercept complaints from places like message boards or comment
sections and contact the angry customer via social media. Like the AIM
attacks of the 1990s, they use fraudulent accounts that appear similar
to those of actual businesses. They then trick the angry customers into
sharing sensitive information with the promise of fixing their problem.

## Stages of social engineering attacks

1. **Prepare**. At this stage, attackers gather information about their
   target. Using the intel, they'll determine the best way to exploit
   them.
2. **Establish trust** (pretexting). Here, attackers use the information
   they gathered earlier to open a line of communication. They'll
   typically disguise themselves to trick their target into a false
   sense of trust.
3. **Use persuasion tactics**. This stage is where the earlier
   preparation really matters. This is when the attacker manipulates
   their target into volunteering information. Sometimes they do this by
   using specific vocabulary that makes them sound like a member of the
   organization.
4. **Disconnect from the target**. After they collect the information
   they want, attackers break communication with their target. They
   disappear to cover their tracks.
