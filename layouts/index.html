<p>I'm <strong>Ohio Olarte</strong> (he/him) from the so-called
Philippines.</p>

<p>I want to make my actions matter to my friends and family. The
memories must be documented as soon as the opportunity presents itself. In all
of the timelines that have converged and diverged, only now is left. All
beautiful places have been created and destroyed; we remain here. In the world
where we pass, how else do we go but on? </p>
