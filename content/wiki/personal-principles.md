## Intro

These are general guiding rules which
I aim to apply when making decisions.
Hopefully they help me:

- Make better decisions faster.
- Reduce anxiety when deciding what to do.
- Live your life more in line with your most important values.
- Behave more like the person you ideally want to be.
