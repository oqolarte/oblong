## What it is

> What literally defines **social ecology** as “social” is its
> recognition of the often overlooked fact that nearly all our present
> ecological problems arise from deep-seated social problems.
> Conversely, present ecological problems cannot be clearly understood,
> much less resolved, without resolutely dealing with problems within
> society. To make this point more concrete: economic, ethnic, cultural,
> and gender conflicts, among many others, lie at the core of the most
> serious ecological dislocations we face today—apart, to be sure, from
> those that are produced by natural
catastrophes.[^tal-bookchin]
