Imagine how the workers seizing the means of production would bring
environmental devastation because of this bread production. It's hard to
imagine a scenario where communism would stop the devastation being
wrought on the ecosystem.[^tal-anticiv] The forests would continue to be
razed to ensure production won’t slow down.

Free bread for everyone today means no bread (or any food) for anyone
tomorrow as the top-soil washes away, the climate warms, the wildlife
goes extinct, and the whole mountain rapidly turns to desert.

Regardless of the economic system in place, the villagers being able to
consume as many fresh loaves of baked bread as they can carry means all
the forests in driving distance of the village are eviscerated,
eventually all the fields become barren, the crops fail, and everyone
starves. This is already well on its way to happening, and switching to
a communist mode of production would do nothing to allay this
inevitability.

“How would you feed people then?”

The answer is simple; tried
and tested for millennia. People would feed themselves instead of
expecting others to labor to feed them; an entitlement that arose with
industrial civilization. People would be inclined to protect the forests
instead of bulldozing them for the supposed convenience of industrial
food production if they picked their food directly from those forests
everyday.
