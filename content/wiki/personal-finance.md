Money doesn't make one happy;
but it's something we use to function
in a society where it is, unfortunately, highly valued.

I don't aim to be rich, which is tricky: how rich is rich?
As far as I know, there's no strict metric, so for me:
being rich is when I can live comfortably and [extend that comfort](/mutual-aid)
to others. I want to have enough to not worry about basic necessities,
but not so much that I become a billionaire.

Wealth does shape interactions within society:
those that have too much of it reshape the systems to let them have more of it.

If at all possible,
I want to [retire early](/simple-living) and
[not have to work](/anti-work) until I'm old.

## Financial Independence

Achieving financial independence, likely a fad into which I
freefall, is difficult especially if it's in
conflict with some parts of my current internal compass.

Still, there are ways to do this: by needing money, and by not needing
money at all.

By needing money, I meant that by having enough money, assets, and/or
investments to live off of for the rest of your life without having to
worry about needing to enter the workforce for salary. In the parameters
established in the capitalistic design of society, this is doable,
albeit very hard.

By not needing money, I meant living off of food that one grows in their
garden, and/or exchanging goods and services not for money, but for
other goods and services that one might need.

Why financial independence, then?

1. I [dislike the idea of work](/anti-work). I can't force myself to
   excel in most careers knowing I am replacing my life hours with
   corporate hours so I could have money for basic needs.
2. I want to do the things that I want with the time I still have. I need the time and space between these [passion projects](/di-why) so I
   don't feel like i'm pressured or rushed to do something.
3. I want to spend my time with [people I love](/friendship).
4. I'd like to [explore as many places](/travel) as I can with the people I love.
   While solo travel is a promising act, doing it with someone
   multiplies the joy (or divides the despair).

## Anti-investment/s

I am not a financial advisor nor my interests are in finance. Take any
of the following not-set-in-stone ideas as naive action points, and
please do your due diligence.

To have more money is to not lose it. *Losing* in this context would
mean not getting benefit from it or worse, putting you at a
disadvantage. An obvious example would be, giving time and/or money to a
mutual aid effort is NOT losing money, but being scammed is.

Some things to consider:

- Give only what you can afford to lose. When you give, you don't expect
  anything in return. This way, you can be generous even the current
  economic system discourages you from being one. If putting a number to
  it helps, decide on this ahead of time. For example, you can only give
  a maximimum of 5% of your total monthly salary per month to mutual aid
  efforts; or, you can allot 3 to 4 hours of your time volunteering for
  non-profit organizations; or, you can only mentor 2 to 3 persons in
  their studies at any given time.
- Avoid credit card debt. In fact, [avoid credit card altogether](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqhGyLP9Q0o)
  ([2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bua07BbeJC0),
  [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6zgmhsCLnc)). If you can't afford
  it in a single payment using cash (or debit), you can't afford it.
  Hard mode: If you can't afford it double its retail price in a single
  payment using cash (or debit), you can't afford it.
- [Learn as much as you can from the world and the people](/being-critical). But don't turn into a know-it-all.
- Treat any digital banks as glorified electronic wallets, i.e., do not
  put your entire life savings in any one (or more) digibanks only, just
  as any smart modern person wouldn't have all their money physically
  cashed out and stored in their leather wallets (or stored in wooden
  cabinets at home).

- There's a difference between cheap and affordability: the former
  implies low quality, the latter implies high, longer lasting quality.
- Managing time wisely has the potential to improve one's life. The days
  are long, but the years are short. If/when you choose to waste time, make sure
  you enjoy it.
- Try to reduce your financial dependency on that one job by [keeping each member of your community safe and secure.](/community).
- Take calculated risks, but don't be afraid to lose something in the
  process.
- You cannot reach your goals alone. [Take care and help yourself](/health), but when you have the capacity, extend your care
  to others as well. Get in touch with your local community. Build one
  with trusted friends and family if there isn't any obvious one
  existing already. Divesting fully from capitalist economic system
  requires us [to imagine and live a life](/prefiguration) that would obsolete the need to
  hoard stuff for our own benefit. If we could share tools, skills,
  food, etc. with our neighbors, then we would technically be finacially
  independent, for the social capital we have built would sustain us.


## COUNTERPOINT to FI/RE

Investing in stock market for the long-term is also known to increase
wealth using compound interests. But here is a Reddit dicussion on [what it potentially means to invest stocks in order to be financially independent.](https://old.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/c7qkjw/rant_you_know_those_comments_here_that_recommend/)

> In order to be optimistic about the success of your investment, you
> have to be pessimistic about the direction that the world is heading
> to.
