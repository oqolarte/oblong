The consequence of quick weather transition,
from hot mornings to rainy afternoons,
conjures an unexplainable feeling of dread within.
I'd like to blame the weather for this feeling,
but I'm sensing that it has something to do with the state of my mental health as well.

Gloomy weather is now more frequent than sun shiny days.
Nothing to worry about, though.

Except that I heard of two deaths already in a span of 60 minutes:

- [John McAfee was found dead in prison](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/john-mcafee-found-dead-prison-after-spanish-court-allows-extradition-2021-06-23/), and by suicide according to reports;
- [Noynoy Aquino, former PH president, dies](https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/23/asia/philippines-benigno-noynoy-aquino-dies-intl-hnk/index.html).

I'm neither a fan nor a hater of both.
But knowing about their unexpected deaths unexpectedly does wonders.
We should've accepted that.
