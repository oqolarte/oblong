From the buggers in Ender's Game to the Borg in Star Trek to the Vord
in Codex Alera to ants and termites themselves from a morph's-eye view
in Animorphs, social insects, and the aliens or artificial
intelligences that closely resemble them, are portrayed as "hive
minds" with an emotional tone of existential terror. And I'm here to
tell you that these portrayals are totally unfair.

## What they get right

- Social insect colonies have queens that are primarily responsible for reproduction.
- Social insects have very different sensory modalities from ours. We humans use sight and sound to communicate and navigate the world,
while social insects use taste and smell and vibration.
- Social insects have specialized division of labor to particular tasks.
- Social insects are willing to sacrifice themselves in droves to protect the colony.
- Sometimes, social insects will enslave others from other colonies or even species to serve their own ends
([x](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave-making_ant)).

## What they get wrong: Queens

In sci-fi, when you kill the queen, the hive
goes into chaos. You've cut off the head! The central
intelligence of the hive is gone! They're just mindless borg-units
with no idea what to do!

Indeed, in some social insects, such as leafcutter ants, if you kill
the queen, the whole colony will die, but probably not for the
reasons you think. However, it's more common for social insects to be
able to carry on just fine regardless. In most ants and bees, there
are "backup" queens that are reared up by the workers in case the
current queen should die. And in many social insects, a worker can
step up and become a queen in her place. (Hilariously, a worker ant
that steps up to reproduce in place of a queen ant is called a
*gamergate*.)

But here is the most important problem with the sci-fi trope of
killing the queen to kill the hive:
*The queen is not the brain of the hive. She is the ovary.*

If you think of a social insect colony as a superorganism, which it's
useful to do in many cases, different groups of insects within the
colony act like organs. One caste protects the colony from invaders,
which is like an immune system. One caste scouts for new places to
forage, which is like a sensory system. Generally, science fiction has
a good grip on this idea. Where sci-fi authors fail is that they think
the queen is the brain of this superorganism. She is not. She is the
reproductive system. The queen does not control what happens in the
hive any more than your reproductive system controls what happens in your body.
She has some influence, but she is not the brains of the operation.

The reason why leafcutter ant colonies die when the queen dies is
because the colony has been *castrated*, not beheaded. Most animals
die when they are no longer able to reproduce, even if their brains
are still perfectly functional. For castrated colonies with no backup
queen or gamergate and no hope of getting one, there is no point in
carrying on. Their evolutionary line has ended.

## What they get wrong: Swarm intelligence

Here is how social insect hive minds work in science fiction: the
queen does the thinking, and the rest of the hive goes along with
whatever she thinks.

Now, I've already told you that the queen is not the brain of the
hive. So where is the brain? Well, that is exactly the point of swarm
intelligence. The brain does not reside in one particular animal. It's
an emergent property of many animals working together. A colony is not
like your body, where your brain sends an impulse to your mouth
telling it to move, and it moves. It's more like when two big groups
of people are walking toward each other, and they spontaneously
organize themselves into lanes so no one has a collision
([x](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwj_1PW5y4HLAhXMPiYKHeI7CegQFggcMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.brown.edu%2Farticles%2F2012%2F07%2Fswarm&usg=AFQjCNENtiOn4Ez-xDnzK_mDo87dFY2wHQ&sig2=Re5bjCzeHKgC0LyLuTIV_g&bvm=bv.114733917,d.eWE)).
There's no leader telling them to do that, but they do it anyway.

Much of the efficiency of social insect colonies comes from very
simple behavioral rules
([x](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3279739/?_escaped_fragment_=po=43.7500#S5title)).
Hymenopterans, the group of insects that includes ants, bees, and
wasps, have a behavioral rule: work on a task until it is completed,
and when it is done, switch to a different task. If you force solitary
bees (yes, most bee species are solitary) to live together, they will
automatically arrange themselves into castes, because when one bee
sees another bee doing a task like building the nest, its behavioral
rule tells it that the task is completed and it needs to switch to a
different task, like looking for food.

Individually, a social insect isn't all that smart, whether it's a
queen, worker, soldier, or drone. But collectively, social insects can
do incredibly smart things, like find the most efficient route from
the colony to some food
([x](http://mute-net.sourceforge.net/howAnts.shtml)), or choose the
perfect spot to build their hive
([x](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/the-secret-life-of-bees-99559587/?no-ist)).

## What they get wrong: Individuality

The existential terror of the hive mind in science fiction comes from
the loss of the self. The idea is that in a social insect colony,
there is no individual, but one whole, united to one purpose. No
dissent, disagreement, or conflicting interests occur, just total
lockstep. I totally get why that's scary.

The thing is, it's just not true of real social insects. There is
conflict within colonies all the time, up to and including civil war.

A common source of conflict within colonies is worker reproduction.
Yes, in most social insects, workers can in fact reproduce, though
usually they can only produce males. So why don't they? Because it's
not in the interest of their fellow workers. Workers are more closely
related to their siblings and half-siblings produced by the queen than
they are to their nephews, so they pass on more of their genes if they
spend resources on raising the queen's eggs. So, if a worker catches
its fellow laying an egg, it will eat the egg. Not exactly "all for
one and one for all," is it?

Worker insects may also fight in wars of succession. If there is more
than one queen in a species where queens do not tolerate each other
(yes, there are species where multiple queens get along together just
fine), such as monogynous fire ants, the workers will ally themselves
with one queen or another and engage in very deadly civil war.

Finally, in some species, the queen needs to bully the workers into
doing their jobs, and the dominant workers need to bully subordinate
workers into doing their jobs
([x](http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~so356/pdfWkrComp.pdf)). Yes,
sometimes workers try to laze around and mooch.

## Surprisingly human

Here's what I find weird about depictions of social insects in science
fiction. They are portrayed as utterly alien, Other, and horrifying.
Yet humans and social insects are very, very similar. The famous
sociobiologists E.O. Wilson and Bernard Crespi have both described
humans as chimpanzees that took on the lifestyle of ants. 

I think what fascinates people, including me, about ants, bees, and
their ilk is that you watch, say, a hundred ants working together to
tear up a leaf into tiny bits and carry it back to their colony, or a
hundred bees all appearing out of seemingly nowhere to sacrifice
themselves en masse to stop a bear from eating their hive, and it
looks like magic. It really does look like some kind of overmind is
controlling their collective actions. 

But imagine you're an alien who comes to Earth, and you know nothing
about humans or the way we communicate. Wouldn't we look exactly the
same to them as ants and bees look to us? Wouldn't they look at us
sacrificing our lives by the thousands in wars, or working together to
build cities from nothing, and think, *Wow, how do they coordinate
themselves in such huge numbers, why do they give up their lives to
defend their borderlines, I guess there must be some kind of
mega-brain they all share that tells them what to do, and they just
march in lockstep and do it.*

If there's anything I've learned from the study of both social insects
and humans, it's that any system that looks monolithic and simple from
a distance is in fact fractured, messy, and complicated when you look
at it up close.

Social insects aren't scary mindless robot-aliens. They're a lot like
you and me. As much as I was terrified as a kid by the Animorphs book
where an ant morphs into Cassie and screams in pure existential horror
at its sudden individuality, I actually think an ant would adjust very
easily to being a human, and that a human would adjust very easily to
being an ant -- much more easily, in fact, than humans adjusted to
morphing, say, sharks, in the very same book series.
