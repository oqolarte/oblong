- Added [two](/edp/#day-14) [new](/edp/#day-15) entries to EDP.
- Updated [FOSS](/foss) page.
- And other minor design fixes.

And then we reached the end of the month of Oct 2024---All Hallows' Eve,
according to some traditions that do follow it. For most of the
Christianity-influenced world, it's Halloween. I don't know what people
are supposed to face, but we certainly are not a fan of going toe to toe
with real life horrors that continue to hound us every which way we go.

## *Each day poking*

[EDP](/edp) is a self-imposed month-long writing exercise meant to document what
is going through my head as I slide willfully into unemployment, at
least for the time being while I recuperate and go back to things that I
enjoy doing.

It is now completed, with 16 entries logged. I initially meant to add
entry everyday, but of course, the real world demands my presence.

## Music

For the month of Oct 2024, these are the albums I listened to.

| Album Name | Artist      |
|------------|-------------|
| Harlequin  | Sofie Royer |
| strongboi  | strongboi   |

I haven't had the pleasure of discovering a lot of new muzak that I
would like this month. Next month, maybe?
