## Now, as predicted

[David Byrne told NME in 1979](https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/david-byrne-predicted-the-future-life-during-wartime/):
> There will be chronic food shortages
> and gas shortages and people will live in hovels.
> Paradoxically, they'll be surrounded by computers
> the size of wrist watches.
> Calculators will be cheap.
> It'll be as easy to hook up your computer with a central television bank as it is to get the week's groceries.
> I think we'll be cushioned by amazing technological development and sitting on Salvation Army furniture.
> Everything else will be crumbling.
> Government surveillance becomes inevitable because there's this dilemma when you have an increase in information storage.
> A lot of it is for your convenience - but as more information gets on file it's bound to be misused.

## On liminality

Considering my weird disposition to many aspects of life,
I might be a liminal character in someone's major story arc.
I maintain the entropy by exerting the minimum effort possible
in a given situation.

This has become more obvious recently,
when my co-workers and I showed up at the office
for the first time since the Pandemic started,
and first time this year.

A lot in that space distracted me,
but I managed to keep it cool for the entire day.

Anyway---at least once I've been called *edgy*.
I denied this, of course.
The accuser likely misunderstood the combination
of my niche idealism politics and healthy dose of dark humor
to be "edgy" in the most Gen Z sense.

I say this because,
the totality of my beliefs,
from what I know so far,
is in the minority.
This makes fitting to a space not easy,
but always worth the (t/w)ry.
