- Added 10 new entries and 4 new one-liners to [Imbentori](/imbentori).

Filipinos can come up with weird and exciting names for their offspring.
Depending on who you ask,
it can be a source of concern because the child
would likely be bullied when they grow up;
or it can be, uh, an ice breaker, to say the least.

The internet has recently reminded me of
the siblings named [Macaroni 85, Spaghetti 88, and Sincerely Yours 98](https://news.abs-cbn.com/lifestyle/01/10/14/meet-siblings-macaroni-85-spaghetti-88-sincerely-yours-98),
the numbers indicating the year they were born.

Weird? Yes, verily so.

Somehow, this reminded me of Isaac Asimov's short story,
[*The Last Question*](https://astronomy.org/moravian/C00-Last%20Question.pdf).
Read it if you haven't already.

Lest I spoil, I'll just say that in the story,
human's names get "weirder" as they evolve.

So maybe the weird-name-giving weird parents are on to something grand here
that many of us just brush aside as another
byproduct of modern-day absurdity.

If you haven't noticed,
I myself have a relatively weird name,
and I have mixed feelings about it ever since.
