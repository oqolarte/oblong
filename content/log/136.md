## Joyful Maths

In a recent [Babbage podcast](https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2023/08/23/eugenia-cheng-on-finding-the-joy-in-maths), [Eugenia Cheng](https://eugeniacheng.com)
claims how maths has helped her be a better person,
by developing the way she thinks.

I'm no mathematician by any metric.
But back in school,
I'd always enjoyed when things clicked for me during maths.
So much so that my first choice when I applied for UPCAT[^upcat] many,
many years back is, no joke, BS Math.

[^upcat]: University of the Philippines College Admission Test.
I didn't make the cut.

That podcast episode reignited my desire to deep-dive into maths,
for the sake of learning more,
and maybe, I too would get better as a person.
I might go through
[Susan Rigetti's Math notes](https://www.susanrigetti.com/math),
starting by reading her recommended popular books.
I will have to [obtain an e-ink reader](/support/#hardware-support)
though.

Slightly related---Tim,
whose blog I follow, has drastically reduced their updates,
likely because [they are still studying AI](https://www.timtimestim.com/n/2021-04.html),
which involves a lot of maths apparently.

## Work-related

I am in the middle of a transition,
which is always an interesting period,
not that I'm regularly in one.
Is there a term for the liminal state between jobs,
like how "sembreak" is for semesters?

As I go from Point A to B,
the work buzz decays from the drab.
To me, this is a good thing.
All falls to place neatly.
If the move is a success,
the transition will have been smooth and quiet,
like how a boring commute should be.

## Addendum to hypocrisy

[A while back](/134/#on-hypocrisy-and-spirituality),
I shared some of my thoughts regarding hypocrisy,
and I have a few more to say on the matter:

As humans, we can never be perfect so long as we contain conflicts.
Our imperfect ways of being brings to life
multiple versions of insincerity,
some of which we're even aware.
This self-awareness, though,
can't be an excuse to harm others or oneself even.
But it can remind us to check in with ourselves
if we're (mis)aligning with our core values.

## On daily news

I'd like to think that I'm not sick of people.
But every time I doubt that sentiment,
I try to look back on the good things that have happened to me
thanks to a combo of right person/s and luck within proximity.

## Music

For the month of Aug 2023, these are the albums I listened to.

| Album Name           | Artist         |
|----------------------|----------------|
| Blue Planet Eyes     | The Preatures  |
| Stick Around For Joy | The Sugarcubes |
| Hatful of Hollow     | The Smiths     |
| Today                | Galaxie 500    |

Because it's the latest one that I went through,
I'd recommend *Today* to anyone who enjoys shoegazing.

My least favorite in this bunch would be *Blue Planet Eyes*
and I speculate it might have something to do with recency.
