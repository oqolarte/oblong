title: "[WRITE] Art as Function of Tech"

Tools help us create. Early humans use rocks and sticks to shape their
space around them, to gather food, to survive. Today, our tools no
longer have a primitive side to it; even bushcraft people are guided by
more modern principles that are not one would call primitive. In fact,
the average person can't make their own tools from raw materials using
only their hands and wits. This is, of course, understandable. Given the
economics of scale, we have outsourced everything elsewhere to people we
won't likely meet. Now, there are devices that can help create cool
drawings and paintings. Technology provides tools like drawing software,
digital cameras, and even 3D printers that artists can use to make their
[art](/art).

But if tools are scarce, expensive, and/or hard to maintain, it doesn't
mean we can't create, does it?

Sometimes, in certain places, access to tools like computers or
high-tech gadgets can be hard. And yet, art can still happen, as it
always have, not in spite of, but especially because of constrains.
While inaccessible tools hinder us from creating more in terms of
quantity, it can lead to innovative solutions into creating more complex
work.

I see it as a challenge, then: these limits can push me to come up with
new ideas that I might not have discovered otherwise.

- Who defines what art is?
- Art's complexity can't be the function of tools' complexity that
  created it, right?
- Art begets art. It can reflect but not resolve.


In the Philippine context, there's no one reason why we create what we
create. The desire to create is a natural impulse. This innate drive
allows us to express emotions, tell stories, explore imagination,
reflect on life, [connect with others](/communication), and leave a
legacy. But art in the Philippines is mostly mass produced for
consumption. Its purpose: decoration.

## Absurdity and Humor

Technology has greatly expanded the possibilities for creating humorous
art and sharing it with a wide audience.

Memes are funny and can be used to bring something to the surface. Humor
magnifies social issues. It's also a coping mechanism.

Art is a great avenue for humor to deliver big issues with a light
touch, making them more accessible and engaging.

- Many comic artists make web comics to highlight the modern day
  [absurdities](/surrealism) in a funny way.
- I wonder what software and hardware they use to make those? iPads?
  Adobe Suite?
- Who controls the tools controls the art.
- Tools and [technology](/technology) should liberate us from, not cage
  into, walled gardens and silos.
- Bad tech is a class issue.
- I am learning FOSS and repair so I am free to (re)make the stuff I
  want, to (re)share them however I want.

## Why use tech for art?

For thousands of years, we have been using technology to make art. The
latter, dare I say, is the result of the improvement of the former. From
cave wall paintings to trash-worthy NFTs (thank gods the hype is over).

Andy Warhol understood, in his own way, and accepted that art is a
function of technology. To explore new frontiers of his art, he used
machines and was not afraid of utilizing them to fit his needs. If it
mean mass producing Pop Art to make a statement, so be it.

For me, I try to master the use of technology when I can so I can be
more efficient in making art. But thinking about it, that's probably the
wrong way of doing it. Well, there's really no right or wrong way. What
I meant was, art is meant to enjoyed. If its creation is rushed, what
are the chances that people would enjoy in experiencing it? I'd assume
that it would be different than when art is thoughtfully, mindfully
crafted over a period of time.
