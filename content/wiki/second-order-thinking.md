## Let's start with examples

Consider the fence described by G. K. Chesterton:

> There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say,

> see the use of this; let us clear it away.” To which the more

> think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the
> use of it, I may allow you to destroy it."

If a fence exists, there's a reason for it.
Not necessarily a good or logical one,
but a reason nonetheless.

Here's another example from agriculture: spraying insecticides might
increase the crop yield in a farmland by killing the pests. But it might
also kill other creatures, like fish and frogs, which [some people in rural areas](/rural-ph)

## To effect or not to effect change?

Before trying [to change existing systems](/revolution),
it's helpful to think about why it was put up in the first place.
Also ask what would be the consequence of the consequence
(second order, you might say)
of our actions, [attempts of intervention](/iatrogenics).

To implement change, be aware of the sociological implications. It is
hard, but it is more possible to do by spending time with the people
which the proposed change would affect. Let them have say in it, have
stake in it.

If action is inevitable, consider taking small steps. Small steps done
consistently are easier to reverse in case there is an unforeseen,
unwanted effect or mistake; and they are more likely to be adopted by those
affected.

[Uncertainty being a function of time](/chaos), we must take this into
consideration when planning. We
cannot predict the future, but we know for sure that it is full of
surprises that we don't know we don't know. Put
simply, allot for the largest wiggle room possible and be open to the
possibility of pivoting to new solutions.
