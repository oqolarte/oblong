## What it is

An **urban heat island** (UHI) occurs when a city experiences much warmer
temperatures than nearby rural areas. The difference in temperature
between urban and less-developed rural areas has to do with how well the
surfaces in each environment absorb and hold heat.

Nighttime temperatures in UHIs remain high. This is because buildings,
sidewalks, and parking lots block heat coming from the ground from
rising into the cold night sky. Because the heat is trapped on lower
levels, the temperature is warmer.

## Feeling it in Metro Manila

In major urban centers like Metro Manila, Philippines, this heat island
effect is quite obvious especially during dry seasons.

One wonders why the local government units don't implement native tree and
shrub planting projects to dampen the heat?

Good architecture deriving knowledge for tropical designs can also be a
good inspiration. Instead, we have more condominiums than big old trees.
