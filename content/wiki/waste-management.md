## Going paperless

It is not shallow to consider the merits of going paperless. After all,
paper sheets come from [trees](/plants), which have been cut down,
washed with [water](/water), processed with energy and other toxic
chemicals.

Beyond paperless, we should also consider radically reducing:
- data centers, which would store our information digitally;
- marketing and advertising, because the amount of content they print
  both on paper and on digital mediums is simply [a waste](/no-ads).

In their spaces, could we replant forests again?
