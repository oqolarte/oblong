**[You are not your job.](/anti-work)** I hope you find that comforting.

Modern society, however, might have other plans for you. It's likely
that you have been told work will be a necessary part of your adult
life. To an extent, it's true; that society functions as it is now
because of people working.

**Right now, [you need to slow down](/slow-productivity)** if you aren't
doing that already. It *is* a radical thing to do in fast-paced world.

You can always "create value" for anyone you care for, even if it's just
a friend or a family. It doesn't have to be just for humans, though. You can
[give back to the animals by being humane towards them](/animal-liberation)
whenever possible.
You can [take care of the environment](/eco-anarchism) by the choices you make, the things you do
or don't buy.

You may not realize it yet, but we have been conditioned to believe that
everything needs to be a job to be performed so that The Boss rewards
you money, which, by the way, is most likely based on an unfair
calculation of your time's worth.

If you've been paying attention to your social media feeds, people never
stopped creating value in spite of the COVID pandemic. Remember those
who created face masks and shields, and gave them for free or donate
them to front liners. Remember the volunteers in feeding programs.
Remember the artists who performed their art and music live, for free,
to keep the spirits up.

How is it that there are those who have tied their identities and
self-worth to their employment? Perhaps they're privileged enough to
actually enjoy whatever it is they are (or are not!) doing, and good for
them. A lot of us don't have that luxury, though, like the laborers with
physically intensive work, especially when their work doesn't really
enrich their lives no matter how many hours they put in.

Consider this: weren't you summoned, too, in this world, to live a life
of [uncertainty](/chaos)? Under [Capitalism](/capitalism),
you're forced to work, or else you'd
starve or not afford basic needs like shelter and clothing. But if
somehow, we could circumvent, if not [totally subvert](/revolution),
all of that, and
start doing things that we like doing, I wonder what would the quality
of life be?

People, in general, has always been productive. We would be more so if
the effects of our work benefited all, not just the select few.
