- Done reading a book and added it to the [list](/books). It's about the
  on-going conflict on [Palestine](/palestine).

It's bad to preset the day's mood and leave it at that state. Our
emotions need not be fixed; they can be fluid. This I need to remind
myself as I wonder why we are having grey skies mid-February as if we're
somewhere cold.

Has Europe somehow found the tech to control the weather and ventured
into atmospheric colonialism and begun summoning gloomy clouds in
tropical countries' skies?

Just kidding.

The singular benefit of having grey skies is that it's cool enough to
take a nap in the afternoon. But when I take naps in the afternoon, I
only fall half asleep. It has happened many times now. I might have
picked up this quirk when I was still working remotely, here at home.
After eating lunch, while still on break, I would try to nap. There were
naps that got me full rested. But mostly, I was half-snoozing,
half-palpitating, the latter an effect of anxiety of having to go back
to grind at 1pm (or thereabouts). This anxiety was why I could not fully
submit myself to that sweet afternoon nap. It happened enough times
that my body thought I was building a habit, so it stuck.

As grey skies become night-black, I dwindle into a sunken mood that's
both familiar and dank. I roll on and off surreal moments as I function
to, say, prepare a meal for the household.

When I look at a screen, I am fooled by the horror and Horror that is
the infinite AI slop that overwhelms digital channels. And yet that same
feeling---particularly this time, of being comforted by recycled
philosophy. I either fight it or ride it out.
