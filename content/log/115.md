## Birthdays

The homestretch of Capricorn season,
according to the horoscope,
looms right after Mid-January,
when all things cold gradually absorbs that familiar heat.

Could weather be a major factor that drives people insane?
I would think so,
based on my own experience.
I recall feeling down on at least two different instances
the past few days.
They would then be dispelled by sleep or sunrise,
whichever comes first.
This leads me to ask,
"Is enlightenment predicated on varying degrees of mental breakdown?"

I know at least four people who celebrated their birthday
on the same day, 9 Jan.
Each of them, I'd like to think,
are enlightened in their own little ways.
And they all don't know each other.
I have no good excuse to introduce them to one another.
There's nothing wrong, though,
with being the common denominator
of strangers who only have their birthdays as that one
string tying them together.
It's just that the logistics are too much for my lethargic self to start,
the reward being inversely proportional.

## Video Game/s

Do you have that something that regularly occurs to you every year?
For me it's seasonal flu...
and seasonal enthusiasm for video gaming.

Perhaps I have entered that annual phase
during which I'm scouring again our library
comprising mostly of games with gun and/or sword fights.

Around this time last year,
we were going through *GTA IV*.
And we kept at it for a few more weeks,
before dropping it completely when February rolled in.

Before that, I reran *Diablo 2*,
and I honestly don't recall beating Baal on the Normal difficulty
using a Weather Druid build.

Before that, we were rolling with *Katamari Damacy*,
which at the time, and even now,
would be impossible for us to speedrun.

Before that...

Nowadays, I'm trying to numb
the depressing effects of cold weather
by rerunning *Fallout: New Vegas*.
