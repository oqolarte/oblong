## In the beginning

Social networking sites
like Friendster and Yahoo Messenger were fun ways to keep in touch
with classmates and friends after school hours, or, if you are older
than me, colleagues from work.

Even when we all started migrating to Facebook, it was just this thing that
we did for a few hours, before eventually logging out to do other
things in the real world.

Now, it's safe to say that a lot has changed. The biggest social media
platforms are designed to retain users for as long as possible, because
our attention means interaction, and interaction means more data for
them to analyze. More data means personalized ads for you and me.

## Monetizing our data

Who does not like seeing the things what our friends and family are up
to these days?
Do we not light up when they talk about something we love [to hate]?
Social connection is important to us, and social media platforms have
become the digital bridges that collapse distance and time between two
or more people.

At the cost of their data.

Our attention spans have been commodified. Unless you're using an
ad blocker, the internet will bombard you with targeted ads no thanks to
the data brokers who have bought a dossier of you, likely from the likes
of Google, Facebook, and other big tech companies.

Everything now can be a brand, and everyone who dreams of making it big
in social media must establish their "[personal brand](/personal-brand)"
(i.e., [market themselves to be profitable](/mr)) and see to it
themselves, lest they deal with doppelgangers and be on the losing end.

To keep us engaged, an algorithm is baked into the design of a social
media platform. No one really fully understands how an algorithm works,
except that it keeps a running tally of what types of "content" a user
usually interacts with, and from this it puts it into a "black box"
(i.e., the algorithm itself where tha magic is made) that outputs a feed
of probably similar content that the user might want to engage with
more. The key is to retain users for as long as possible, and the
algorithm is one of the main tools for that.

If you are interacting with friends, families, or even strangers, in
social media, but are using it through a colorful, algorithmically
personalized feed, are you sure it benefits everyone involved, or is it
just the cheap thrill of chasing dopamine that pushes the loneliness
away, if only for a while? I ask this because many people may not be
aware of [the pros and cons of maintaining relationships online](/online-bonds).

People who use social media as work---the so-called influencers and
content creators---are stuck in appeasing the algorithm, creating more
"content" in unhealthy rates to stay relevant.

### Surveillance

So, is monetization, then, the problem?

Not necessarily, I think. Although, chasing growth and profit
[has never been not destructive](/destruction), as we should know by now.

I think there are a few important questions to ask: Who owns the means of
production? Who owns these social media platforms, and what are they
doing with all the data they are gathering from their userbase?

Also, if we're using social media through our phones, [how do they get our data](/surveillance)?

To that last question, Savva Pistolas offers some insights in their write-up "[Pointing at the mushrooms - Identifying our own digital colonisation](https://pistolas.co.uk/mushroom/)" (emphasis mine):

> While social media is objectively consuming your usage data to produce
> tailored advertisements - up to and including your message content,
> what you're viewing, how you scroll, and who you're talking to, it is
> **not recording your voice in the background**.
> 
> [...]
> 
> It would be so much less worrisome if social media privacy abuse was
> as simple as recording you and spitting adverts back at you, but it is
> far more sophisticated and resource efficient than that. We are
> correct to assume that our phones 'observe us'. It's not using the
> microphone though, it's certainly not 'interacting' with you, **it's
> just accepting everything that you're offering up to it**.

## Parasocial media?

There's also the concern of how "social" really is social media.

More and more, by amplifying rage through the algorithm, it has pit us
against one another with hate, *while* facilitating the arena in which
we digitally spew vitriol at each other from our safe space, our
attention and engagement being the *only* fee they ask.

## To destroy the master's house using master's tools

For those against the surveillance capitalism, whether enabled by parasocial
media, is it even productive to spread propaganda within their platforms?

Yes, I believe so, with caveats.

Social media has been used by activists to platform their beliefs in
order to reach more people, and
to start convincing people to join a worthy cause---be it in
dismantling the capitalism or [abolishing the empire](/abolition)---first
we meet them everywhere and
everywhen they gather.

However, we must not forget we are still playing by the house's rules.
JP Hill reminds us in his essay (with the title being a reminder in
itself) "[Social media is the house that always wins](https://www.jphilll.com/p/social-media-is-the-house-that-always)"
that information alone cannot win a fight, especially if the house keeps
on changing the rules, or keeps switching management that would
potentially change rules.

Lastly, we need to be aware of the possibility of putting more value
than what's necessary to public performance. More than oration, more
than pulling people into debates, [the action is in the real world](/activism),
[starting with our communities](/community).

### POSSE

If anything, [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) (Publish (on your) Own
Site, Syndicate Elsewhere) is a good startegy from the IndieWeb when
using social media platforms in conjunction with a dedicated website or
blog that is outside of big tech. And if you are to syndicate your posts
to social media, make sure to share as little personally identifiable
information (PII) as possible, using the platforms infrastructure and
reach merely as portals for others to go to your main website. There are
several catches to this. One of which, among many, is that managing and
facilitating discussions in the comment and reply sections across
different plaforms would get too cumbersome too fast. (This might be why
bigger celebrities hire their own "social media manager/s.")

In his post "[Reconsidering POSSE](https://starbreaker.org/grimoire/entries/reconsidering-posse/index.html),"
Matthew Graybosch writes about how he (or anyone) "need[s] not syndicate
to such [social media] platforms [like Mastodon or Bluesky]," and
suggests that syndication is possible with dedicated blogging platforms
like [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev/), [Write.As](https://write.as/),
or [Dreamwidth](https://www.dreamwidth.org/); or to a newsletter service
like [Buttondown](https://buttondown.com/).

## Comments and replies

I am a nobody in the whirlpool of people using social media and internet
at large. [Since this personal site of mine was up on late 2020](/1), I have
rarely, if at all, received a comment or reply sent in via email. Which
is my saying that in terms of managing the "comment section" I have it
relatively easy. To be honest, I think it is because of the following reasons:

- People are drawn to more interesting persons than me;
- Interesting things done by interesting persons have the chance to go
  viral, and thus land in the eyes of many people, thanks to the
  algorithm native in many social media, in which I am not in;
- Replying or commenting to any one of my posts means going through the
  friction of actually sending me an email about it, as I have no blog
  comment hosting service implemented; and
- People just do not know that I have this site.
