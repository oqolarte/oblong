Over at new work, a coworker mentioned that as we enter Q4 2023,
businesses will burn through their budget this year.
I hadn't thought about it that way,
and I also have no interest on confirming its merit;
but the way those combo of syllables landed just made perfect sense.
The trajectory of busyness, meaningless or otherwise,
will increase when businesses decide it's that season
again to ramp up everything for The Markets.

*Expect the work to pour in*.
In my head, I translated that as "Show up."
Of course, I intend to do both of that whenever
my fine energy soars to acceptable levels,
but not only within work context.

On personal spaces, I've maintained quiet relationships
with the occasional bursts of laughter in right times.
I decided that September would be I tone it down a bit
before "burning through" the coming days.
This is how we all get through the messy parts of adulthood:
mindful usage of wits and puns as coping mechanisms.
People won't always get you when it "switch[es] things up"
but Try I Will. *Always*.

## Music

It's rather a quiet month for me, music-wise.
The only album I listened to was **pop songs 2020** by BUMPER,
a music (pandemic?) project of Michelle Zauner and Ryan Galloway.
The totality of four songs brings me that non-toxic, non-addictive nostalgia,
and I mean that in a good way.
