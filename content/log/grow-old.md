*Hirap tumanda.*

It's already evening as I type this out.
Just got home from Isya's Inay's home in Marikina.

Ate Emelyn (not sure of the spelling or if I heard it right) and I prepared the lunch.
According to survey, the food was good.

What does it mean to grow old?
Does it mean wisdom?
Does it mean forfeiting everyday human function in order to live longer?

Impatience of one elderly seems to ripple to every person trying to take care of them.

Bless all the caretakers!
