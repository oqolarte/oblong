People in my orbit have noted that Aries season
is truly here, its nostrils flaring 33-degree-Celsius humid air.
A tropical climate fitting for the ram trope of hot-headedness.
It would be foolish to be out and about when the sun nears zenith.
But many still risk it for whatever valid reason
despite higher chances of heat stroke.

In feeling this, I'm reassured that all of this is Real.
I *am*, too, because the sensations of sweat forming on my skin
and it evaporating could not have stemmed from
Large Language Models and the supercomputers that run them.

Since I was a kid, I questioned the very nature of Reality.
Much later, I found out I was already toying with [solipsism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism)
at an early age.

More than two decades later,
we have ChatGPT at our disposal that allows us
["to drown in a sea of pedestrian takes,"](https://maggieappleton.com/ai-dark-forest)
as Maggie puts it.

I'm *really* not much of a swimmer,
but my way of going against these waves of lukewarm deluge of generic texts
is to maintain [this wabi-sabi of a site](/site),
replete with its *n*[^n] grammatical errors disguising as neo-Dada musings.

[^n]: *n* is positive integer greater than 1.

How do you prove you're human? [Manu shares his thoughts](https://manuelmoreale.com/verified-human):

> There's no blue checkmark[^blue-check] to prove it but I am, a human...
> It sounds rather bizarre to even think about,

> it won't be long before the internet is filled with "non-humans".

[^blue-check]: In most social media sites at the time of writing,
having a blue checkmark means the account is "verified."
Tumblr took this further and added the colors of the rainbow,
and more, when "buying" (yes, it can now be bought) a checkmark.

To even ask for proof is absurd at this point.
Is it even a worthwhile task?
That I'm existing despite the harsh conditions I live in
should be enough that my Here and Now is as Real as everyone else's.
