## On Machine Consciousness

Manuel DeLanda, in *War in the Age of Intelligent Machines* (1991) believes that:

> Humans didn't really invent machines. A hurricane is a motor in the
> literal sense. When a hurricane is born, a lot of self-organizing
> processes are involved that bring the heat from the outside and
> concentrate it in a reservoir. It took centuries before humans
> discovered the motor, something that self-assembles spontaneously in
> nature. As soon as you let matter and energy in any form flow in a
> non-linear manner (that is, past a certain threshold of complexity)
> machines will tend to spontaneously self-assemble. The key word here
> is 'non-linear'.
>
> Unlike social constructivism which achieves openness by making the
> world depend on human interpretation, Deleuze achieves it by making
> the world into a creative, complexifying and problematizing cauldron
> of becoming. Because of their anthropocentrism constructivist
> philosophies remain prisoners of what Foucault called 'the episteme of
> man,' while Deleuze plunges ahead into a post-humanist future: In
> which the world has been enriched by a multiplicity of non-human
> agencies. And in contrast to other materialistic or realistic
> philosophies of the past. The key non-human agency in Deleuzian
> philosophy has nothing to do with the negative, with oppositions or
> contradictions but with pure, productive, positive difference. It is
> ultimately this positive difference, and its affirmation in thought,
> that insures the openness of the world

Honestly, that's a lot to take in.
Keeping it here so I can come back to it,
in case I need to be grounded to... *something*.

## On my heavy metal phase

The part 2 of the final season of *Attach on Titan* is now out on Netflix.

The hype is real, of course.
It helps that the opening song is [The Rumbling by SiM](https://youtu.be/qpHvj5pvvhg).

This made me think about how I feel about heavy metal as a music genre in
general.
I thought I was already past it, with growing up and old and all that.
It turns out that while I was never fully immersed in it,
part of me that *is* in it, never really left it.

I never understood the growling and screaming then.
Now, if/when I like a heavy metal song,
it's one of the things I look forward to.

My brother taught me how to be a part-time metalhead.
