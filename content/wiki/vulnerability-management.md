For every asset that needs protecting, there are many vulnerabilities.
Finding those vulnerabilities and fixing them before they become a
problem is the key to [keep an asset safe](/asset-security).

**Vulnerability management** is the process of finding and patching
vulnerabilities. Vulnerability management helps keep assets safe.

1. [Identify vulnerabilities](/vulnerability-assessment)
2. Consider potential exploits
3. [Prepare defenses against threats](/defense-in-depth)
4. Evaluate those defenses

Cyber attacks can sometimes be prevented with the right information,
which starts with knowing where your systems are vulnerable. Moreover,
there are other ways to identify vulnerabilities and threats, like
making use of [open-source intelligence](/osint).

## Common vulnerabilities and exposures

One of the most popular libraries of vulnerabilities and exposures is
the CVE list. The common vulnerabilities and exposures list, or CVE
list, is an openly accessible dictionary of known vulnerabilities and
exposures.

The main purpose of the CVE list is to offer a standard way of
identifying and categorizing known vulnerabilities and exposures. Most
CVEs in the list are reported by independent researchers, technology
vendors, and ethical hackers, but anyone can report one. Before a CVE
can make it onto the CVE list, it first goes through a strict review
process by a CVE Numbering Authority, or CNA.

The CVE list tests four criteria that
a vulnerability must have before it's assigned an ID.

1. Must be independent of other issues
2. Must be recognized as a potential security risk
3. Must be submitted with supporting evidence
4. Can only affect one codebase (i.e., only one program's source code)

The [NIST National Vulnerabilities Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln)
uses what's known as the [common vulnerability scoring system](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss), or CVSS,
which is a measurement system that scores the severity of a
vulnerability. Security teams use CVSS as a way of calculating the
impact a vulnerability could have on a system. They also use them to
determine how quickly a vulnerability should be patched.

The NIST National Vulnerabilities Database provides a base score of CVEs
on a scale of 0-10. Base scores reflect the moment a vulnerability is
evaluated, so they don't change over time. In general, a CVSS that
scores below a 4.0 is considered to be low risk and doesn't require
immediate attention. However, anything above a 9.0 is considered to be a
critical risk to company assets that should be addressed right away.
