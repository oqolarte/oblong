Can I trust myself to accomplish what is needed to be able to help those
around me eventually?

These are my notes *trying* to answer that question.

{{< toc >}}

## Finances

For a few years now, I'm taking care of
[my finances](/personal-finance), trying to keep track of my spending
habits. It is boring, but it helps me with budgeting. Sadly, our
[current systems are still governed by the chase of money](/capitalism).
Looking after my bank is a small
step towards not being a burden to my [community](/community).

## Sense of Purpose

It may sound overrated, but many people do feel empty not knowing with
certainty their sense of purpose.
But I think it is up to us to look for it and create it.

I have the choice to make my own fate. But such an act of creation
is a life-long process of choosing for oneself a path from among the
divergence, acknowledging that the chosen path would likely split into
more paths. The act of choosing, too, is not easy. And the paths---how
does one even begin to consider them? And so on. I ask these questions
to myself from an oblique angle, and thus, the answer could not come
soon enough. That's it: an existential nag to both the self and the
society it is bound within, to have a function among its ranks. Or
maybe, [the joke of finding purpose is to not do it at all](/nihilism).

What my purpose is, to be honest, has not fully come to me yet, if it
will at all; but expression through
[writing](/writing) seems to keep the tinder alive. It's one of those
hobbies that I get to feel contented. My style isn't golden, but words
could strike future-me with polished wit from which I could iterate a
new thought.

I'm also eyeing on [repairing broken things](/repair).
Instead of sending them to landfill, why not try fixing them first?

And in that sense, I wonder if [social revolution](/revolution) is an attmept at fixing
broking things that span lifetimes?

## On Past Lives

Nostalgia lets itself in uninvited. When it visits, all doors and
drawers are reopened. Childhood memories pop up when some random thing
triggers it. Now, the intricacies meshed with my childhood is something
I can't let go, nor they are worth to let go of. But its purpose remains
trivial: only to remind me of trials I had to endure to get
here. I believe enough of its importance that I keep it in the back of
my mind, sitting there when I have prepared myself to revisit them, or
when some random thing triggers it.

## Trusting my Guts

There aren't many instances that I recall listening to my inner voice,
but in the aftermath of a good decision, I realize that my gut feeling
leads me through the arcane processes of fate. It doesn't sound
scientific at all. Let me explain.

Before making a decision, [it's only reasonable to gather as many data](/data-management)
as one can, and structure them in such a way
that it presents knowledge on which one can then act. But not all
times do we gain all the data right away, if at all. In these
situations, my inner voice tells me to wait it out, be patient. Most
often, "[waiting it out](/slow-productivity)" has revealed better options for me, that it was, and often, still is, a good choice.

This particular rate of decision-making, though, will not work in the
competitive environment of corporate world, where something must be done
ASAP.

## Spirituality

In a religious country, to question the existence of god/s will get
people shaking their heads in disbelief, at the minimum.

My spirituality, though, doesn't have to be
anchored to any [religion](/religion).
Committing to any religion is not something I
see myself doing for a long time. But I'm not going to tell people
they are idiots because they believe in god/s. As long as they do not
force people into submitting to the same beliefs as theirs, we are good.

To me, spirituality, doesn't necessarily mean a presence of soul within
the corporeal form, but a state of mind. To be spiritual is to freely
express oneself.

## Show putting on for others?

I have a quiet digital life, a product of deleting my accounts on some
[major social media](/social-media) like Facebook and Twitter. I still maintain my
contact with some of my friends and family through their phone numbers,
or via Signal Messenger.
If I don't have their numbers, it means we are not in enough regular
contact to make an effort to sustain the relationship. I have always
wanted to live my life in my own terms. The idea of doing it to please
somebody else cannot be sustained.

## Envy

There are people out there whose lives I envy:

1. **Musicians**: Since I have experienced music at a young age, I
   already knew then that it's something that I will be chasing for the
   rest of my life. Right now, though, my talents limit me to listening
   to music, not creating them. For a while in my high school days, I
   joined a band as a drummer, but my skills were non-existent. I was
   out of time, out of sync, but my band mates and I had fun. We covered
   music from our favorite groups for fun. I didn't expect to make a
   living out of it. Although I still imagine myself performing for a
   large audience in a sold-out concert. As a real-life musician,
   though, I've come to realize that it takes a certain kind of passion
   to know that one must consistently practice and perform their own
   songs over and over. It takes work.
2. **Rich people**: Money solves problems, that is the reality. Having
   enough money addresses the basic needs. Having lots of money
   addresses more needs and wants. In the culture of consumerism,
   wanting more is not sustainable. So while I envy people who are far
   richer in wealth than I am, I question their shady lifestyle choices
   that affects the rest of us.
3. **Scientists**: Their studies, discoveries have continued to make
   impact in our lives. At some point in my life, I wanted to become
   one, huddled in my own lab or shuffling about out in the field.
   Scientists, however, in the [Philippines](/pilipinas) encounter difficulties in
   funding. The actual research is only half of the problem that
   requires solution.

## Learning and unlearning

My interaction with people around me over the years has shaped me into
who I am today, for better or for worse. I turned to idols and emulated
what I thought was their best traits, only to unlearn them much later.

This cycle of learning and unlearning is still what I am going through
today. I don't aspire to be fully optimized; there is no peak to reach,
only a horizon to go after. By observing others and taking on multiple
perspectives, I hope to challenge myself to be a better person.
