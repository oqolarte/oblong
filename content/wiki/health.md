I don't wish to live forever,
but I do want to do as many things in life as possible.
Improving and maintaining my health is one major way to accomplish that.

Be aware of [intervention that might lead to worse outcomes](/iatrogenics).

## Physical Fitness

Fitness depends on many factors (no, not like [BMI](/BMI)),
but these factors can
be simplified into three: exercise, nutrition, and recovery. In turn, it
affects many aspects of social life, including
[friendships](/friendship) and [sexual relationships](/sex).

I'm currently doing [calisthenics](/calisthenics) and yoga as my main
form of physical exercise.

My cardio is embedded in daily life in the form of long walks, cycling
to and from work on a single-speed [bike](/bike), taking stairs when
possible, etc.

I have also been [smoke-free](/quit-smoking) since Jun 2017.

### Protein

As a guideline, consume 140 grams of protein daily to gain muscle mass.

### On "Gym Bros"

How could one be happy with being simply in shape without
worrying about not having the "perfect" physique?

Gym bros, with their obsession on growing their muscles and calculating
the amount of fat, need to check themselves whether they are experiencing body
dysmorphia and/or eating disorder, which are usually underdiagnosed in
men.

Here are some ideas:

- Be more interested in what the body can do compared to how it looks.
  In my experience, this affects my mental wellbeing better especially
  when I can be the functional guy who can help people by lifting things
  for them.
- Find a hobby that doesn't involve body image.
- Reduce the amount of exposure you have to (i.e., don't actively seek)
  images and/or videos of jacked people on the media.

## Sleep

Sleep is *very* important.

It's the time when the body heals and regenerates and consolidates the
information from the day past.

Many would argue that it's more important than
diet, which itself is more important than exercise.
If your sleep is bad, diet won't work, and you wont' have proper
workout.

## Self-care

To be of help, I must help myself first.

Many people, myself included, tend to neglect themselves while caring
for others. Particularly for me, personal care has not been a priority and
often, my lethargy sees it as a hurdle in life.

I know now that I should care more for myself, so that I'm able to
care for others. It's true: one can't extend a helping hand when oneself
is physically ill from self-neglect.

I am thinking of ways to be more [self-reliant](/self-reliance) where possible,
and still be open to community-building.

When I take care of my own well-being, I'll have the physical and mental
capacity [to extend that](/mutual-aid) to people for whom I care the
most. The result, I hope, is the strengthening of relationships that
make life better for all of us.

Tracy Durnell, on her blog post, [Extending my understanding of self-care](https://tracydurnell.com/2023/10/14/extending-my-understanding-of-self-care-indieweb-carnival-october-2023/)
she makes a good point:
"Advocacy is also self care in that it's empowering to participate in
local decision making, the improvement will benefit me along with the
entire community[.]"

As we better ourselves,
we go on to add and subtract things from our lives to be a step
closer to what we want to be,
and this life-long task of personal change effects those around us.

But, this is not to say that we can't allow ourselves to ask for help.
Needing and wanting help from others can also free us from the
capitalist baggage of ultra-self-optimization to the point of isolation,
of being "lonely at the top," which I always find odd.
