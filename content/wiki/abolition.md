Abolition means a world with no police and no prisons, and the necessary
steps we need to make it possible eventually. It's neither police nor
prison reform; it means uprooting those two which are based on the
old-think of punishing the harm-doer, and ensuring these institutions
won't be needed again ever.

## On prisons

Prisons as they exist now are crimes against humanity, designed to
*require* cruelty from those that operate it daily---including guards,
wardens, doctors and other medical workers, and other laborers in
between---and they need to be abolished regardless of the fallout.
Whatever shape or form the prison industrial complex takes, we can be
sure that it will strip its prisoners off of their humanity. Throwing
people in them can never be in the name of justice.

Many crimes today exist because of systemic issues.
[With tighter community](/community)
and building spaces where both kids and adults can flourish
and express themselves,
crimes would be less likely to happen as
[people would be looking out for each other](/mutual-aid).
And anyway, the current (in)[justice](/transformative-justice) system
barely solves half of the cases; jails don't stop people now.

## Why "no police"

Imagine: they get in their "riot suits" and commit [violence](/violence)
against police protest. It is happening, so imagine no more.

If you are privileged, it's unlikely for you or your social circle to
have had direct negative experience with the police. They mostly target
the victims of classism, sexism, and in many countries, racism, and the
activists that help those. And we pay for this violence through taxes.

Police also enforce all laws in which 99% of us had no say. Many of
these laws, then, do not really aim to better our lives but only those
who made them, lawmakers who don't fully represent us except maybe when
our wellbeing somehow tangents briefly to their agenda.
