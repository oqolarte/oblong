When [Meredith Whittaker](https://mastodon.world/@Mer__edith), President
of [Signal](https://signal.org/) (the messaging app), was interviewed by
Andy Greenberg for Wired in the article
[*Signal Is More Than Encrypted Messaging. Under Meredith Whittaker, Itâ€™s Out to Prove Surveillance Capitalism Wrong*](https://www.wired.com/story/meredith-whittaker-signal/)", she said how she would need to reach one of her engineers "with a pager" in case Signal's servers go down.
The passing mention of **pager** sparked a renewed interest.

I have never had one, a pager, but I remember the awe feeling when I
first saw it, when a cousin coolly unholstered it from his hip to check
the notification.

Pagers were mostly phased out by the
time I got my first mobile phone. In terms of practicality, mobile
phones are objectively more useful. Of course, pagers are still in use
today, particularly in the medical field. Outside that, some fast food
chains and coffee shops also use them to "call" the customer when
their order is ready to be picked up from the counter.

However, the recent terror attack of Israel against Lebanon using
exploding pagers---and later, walkie-talkies, which I'm also interested
in!---made me re-evaluate this rabbit hole of mine *big time*.

The articles below are provided for posterity, but the reader is invited
to do their own research.

I won't/can't offer any political analysis in this post; the reader will
have to make it on their own. But, someone on the internet wonders in
jest maybe, could this possibly explain the spontaneous combustion
stories from the early 2000s?
