## Know your audience.

  people to listen to you? Put yourself in the scene and
  describe the situation in clear detail.

  with, convince, or persuade? Describe their position, mood,
  receptivity, possible objections, or resistance.
- WHERE and WHEN will this communication take place?
- WHY will it be worthwhile for your audience to listen to you?
  How will this benefit them? How will it help them succeed,
  make money, save time, achieve their goals?

    - For people to care, share a true story of that person who
      has experienced the value of what you're suggesting.
- Personalize your content.
    - You want people to picture what you're saying.
    - You can put them in the SCENE:
        - Sensory details
        - Characters
        - Experience it: Use emotion.
        - Narrative: Back and forth dialogue.
        - Epiphany: Moment of understanding, moral of the story
- Interact with your audience.
    - Make your actions matter.
    - Adding 'you' questions. These let your audience connect
      with the message.

    - Share why your skills would benefit the team.
    - Talk about the problems you've solved.
- Practice delivery.
    - Don't practice your speech in front of the mirror. Doing
      so causes you to be self-conscious, which is the opposite
      of what you want when you speak.

     level.

    - Repeat your key message in intro, during, and close of
      talk.
- Answer tough questions.
    - Don't explain because explanations come as excuses.
        - Instead, agree, apologize, act.
    - Don't defend or deny untrue accusations. Give it back to
      them by asking "What do you mean?"
        - This will reveal the real issue and you can address
          that instead.
- Communicate the unknown.
    - Go beyond "I don't know".
    - Tap into the crowd. "Who here has expertise in this?"
    - Reply later.
    - If asked something you don't want to answer, change the
      conversation.
