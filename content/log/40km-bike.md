- Added four new entries and two new one-liners in [Imbentori](/imbentori).

In order to get to a small (less than ten pax) gathering,
I challenged myself to arrive and depart there on two-wheels,
fueled only by my will.

One way is around 20km.
A round trip is *maybe* death sentence for an inexperienced rider like me.

Good thing: it's a Sunday, and there are almost no cars on the road.
Dashing past me were lanky bikers in much better form,
great danes on roadies.
My "long" distance starter pack:
helmet, safety vest with reflectors, tail light, comfy clothes, one-liter water bottle, a bag full of other goodies, and maybe a 700kg mountain bike.

Bad thing:
I knew it would rain; the sky wore parking lot colors on dusk.
About one-third of the way back home,
it started pouring heavily, and I was already worn out.
In my exhaustion,
I decided to bike through it.
WRONG MOVE---my backpack was already full,
it got heavier as everything got wet.
It was as a literal torture to Breathing through my wet mask,
which I had to pull slightly down just so I don't collapse in the
middle of the road.

Will I do it again?
*Yes*.
But I'll be in much better shape for next time.
