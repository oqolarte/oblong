## Media Center

Instead of drying my eyes staring on a screen, I kickstarted a project:
repurpose an old laptop into a media center.
Said laptop is a dust-collecting Thinkpad T440 with a dock.
It's a relatively simple project, nothing to write here about.
But here's the roadmap:


- [x] Update soft- and firmware
- [ ] Replace keyboard (~90% are no longer working)
- [ ] Buy HDMI cable
- [ ] Legally obtain media

## iPod Classic

I listen to muzak on my commute home, but it's getting harder to do that
because of the faulty headphone jack of my phone. For some reason, the
jack keeps slipping out of place. It gets annoying when muzak
stutters like that. What's more annoying is that my temporary solution
is to keep a hand in my pocket with the phone, collecting beads of sweat
as one finger pushes down on
the jack so that it stays there, as it should!

*This can't be it*, I say to myself.

I thought of buying and repurposing a second-hand iPod Classic online,
but I resorted to borrowing [the one](https://seekers.araw.xyz/repair-ipod/) my partner already has the she is
not currently using.

It is not without its own issues that it has picked up, I think, from
months of neglect. For one, the battery seems to drain quicker than
expected. I will have to look into this.
