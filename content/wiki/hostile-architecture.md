One bright day, I saw a closed-down building with its few steps to the
facade occupied with rolls of barbed wire. Obviously, this is hostile
architecture, designed and installed ad hoc to deter homeless people
from squatting the space.

This dirty strategy not only targets homeless people, but it could also
target you, to limit your behavior in whatever way in public spaces.

Go to any mall, and you will notice that many of them do not have
readily available benches and chairs. The floor is not really the ideal
resting place for many of us, especially people with limited mobility,
and even if one could sit on floor, not only is it not dignified, it's
also prohibited in some places because doing so is deemed loitering.
