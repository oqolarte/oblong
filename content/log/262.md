- Finally, after many, *many* months, this site is available again in
  Tor. See footer for link to onion site.
- Edited [Support](/support) page.

I have not had any success in finding work lately, which means more time
to read, to lounge, and maybe to express myself authentically, so long
as they all bring the least amount (preferably zero) of harm to others.

Other notable uses of free time this week:
- Slowly going through *House MD* Season 1; can't help but notice the
  lack of Filipino nurses (so far?).
- An entire morning spent dreaming, waiting, and finally having coffee
  because our lives are now ruined without caffeine.
