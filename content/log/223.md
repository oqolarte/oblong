## Thoughts on & around *Breaking the Cycle* (2024)

We watched this Thai political documentary directed by Aekaphong
Saransate and Thankrit Duangmaneeporn. It follows
[Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanathorn_Juangroongruangkit)
and the ambition of his party at the time (now dissolved because of a
court ruling) to "break the cycle" of coups in Thai politics.
Their story shares similarities with the Philippines politics, in that
we are stuck with essentially the same people running the show.

Following the screening was a discussion with a panel comprising:

- Nymia Pimentel Simbulan
- Tony La Vi√±a
- Ferdinand Sanchez
- Karel Jiaan Antonio Galang
- Hannah Jimala

Safe to say that many,
if not most, of the audience come from a progressive politics. The vibe
of the room, from where I was sitting, had not shifted much. As I said,
the
[Future Forward Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Forward_Party)'s
story
follows a similar trajectory as that of
[Angat Buhay](https://www.angatbuhay.ph/), the non-government organization that
Leni Robredo and her team launched after her term as vice president
expired.

The discussion mostly revolved around the possible steps we can take to
"break the cycle." With politicians gearing up for Elections 2025, the
consensus, I think, can be distilled to:

- Vote wisely.
- Be the change you want to be.
- Join an organization.

I agree with all of them. I just feel the pebble in my boot when
Professor Simbulan twice said the need to "conscientize, politicize, and
organize" the youth and student sector; and that the only way to affect
change is by joining an organization with a proper structure. To that
latter bit, I disagree. It is a good way, great maybe, but *not* the only way.

A group of friends can organize to cook food and feed the houseless in
their community. Housemates can take turns in taking out the trash or
washing the dishes or preparing dinner. Workmates can plan a
mini-basketball league with other departments, even without the sanction
of HR, and I've personally witnessed it happen! All these things can be
done, *are* being done, and they will continue to happen without the
formality of a "structure". 

These examples are just as important, if not more dare I say, as the
loud and massive demonstrations that many leftist groups deploy. It's
because we cannot ignore the daily life; we are in it. Even if many of
us shun politics, as Karel Galang observes, it is important to
destigmatize participation in politics. Even if we don't know it, daily
life is replete with politics; we are in it.
