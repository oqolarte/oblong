## Working title: "Art as a function of Tech"

- Tools help us create.
- What if tools are scarce, expensive, and/or hard to maintain? Does it
  mean we can't create?
- Inaccessible tools hinder us from creating more.
- What art can we make with simpler tools? Without tools at all?
- Can simpler tools only make simpler art? Can the wielder make more
  complex art?
- Who defines what art is?
- Art's complexity can't be the function of tools' complexity that
  created it, right?
- Art begets art. It can reflect but not resolve.
- In the Philippine context, there's no one reason why we create what we
  create.
- The desire to create is a natural impulse.
- But art in the Philippines is mostly mass produced for consumption.
  Its purpose: decoration.
- Memes are funny and can be used to bring something to the surface.
- Humor magnifies social issues. It's also a coping mechanism.
- Art is a great avenue for humor to deliver big issues.
- Many comic artists make web comics to highlight the modern day
  [absurdities](/surrealism) in a funny way.
- I wonder what software and hardware they use to make those? iPads?
  Adobe Suite?
- Who controls the tools controls the art.
- Tools and [technology](/technology) should liberate us from, not cage
  into, walled gardens and silos.
- Bad tech is a class issue.
- I am learning FOSS and repair so I am free to (re)make the stuff I
  want, to (re)share them however I want.
