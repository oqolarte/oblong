## Data and Charts

Stories are illustrated by charts, graphs, tables.
These tools present [data sets in a meaningful way](/data-management).

However, statistics cannot provide all the answers!
Too much quantification can be a problem. For example, do we really need
data on coffee preference before making it, instead of just making it?

## The Middle
A statistical story starts in the 'middle': mean, median, mode.
- mean: average
- median: middle: (n+1)/2
- mode: most common
- some data sets might have no mode
- (all data points appear only once),
or multi-modal
(some different data points appear equal number of times)

## Variability

Variability is how spread-out data sets are.

Range studies the 'edges' of a data set, as compared to its middle.
However, this only considers two data points, the smallest and largest value.

Standard Deviation is the average squared distance of a data point from the mean.
Z-score: a data point's distance, in standard deviations, from the mean.
Empirical Rule: Most of the data points in each data set fall within three standard deviations of the mean

In a normal distribution, empirical rule says that 68% of all your data are within one standard deviation from the mean.
95% of data points fall within two standard deviations from the mean.
99.7% of data points fall within three standard deviations from the mean.
Outlier is a data point that is an abnormal distance from the other values in the data set.
Outliers, when investigated, can give us new insights.
