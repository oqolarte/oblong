## Thinking about challenges

***What are the main challenges that a laborer in [transportaion](/transpo) face
everyday when availing important social services?***

### Workers as pedestrians, pedestrians as workers

All workers start their commute as pedestrians. And in a car-centric
highly urbanized area like the Metro Manila, pedestrians already face a
lot of challenges:

- insecure and unsafe sidewalks, if there are any at all;
- overpasses that are steep and inaccessible for PWDs and senior
  citizens;
- lack of waiting sheds;
- and many more.

On-going mismanagement of public funds eventually trickles down to the
working class. We feel this through many things. As commuters, the
rising fare for public transportation cuts significantly through the
daily wage. Add to that issue is that using public transport daily is
dehumanizing at its current state. In the article "[DOTr officials ordered to take public transport at least once a week](https://www.abs-cbn.com/news/nation/2025/9/16/dotr-execs-ordered-to-commute-at-least-once-a-week-1124),"

Acting Secretary of Department of Transport (DOTr) Giovanni Lopez
himself said that his three-hour commute from home to office using
public transpo was "like a warzone."

Accessibility of transportation, when workers need to travel to and from
work, should be improved in relation to traffic. It is too embedded in
our culture to wake up so early in the morning to have enough time to
prepare and travel to work. Sometimes, the traffic gets so bad that even
waking up at dawn is still not enough, and some still arrive late to
their work, suffering from lost hourly wages.

The labor code and its implementing rules does not recognize travel from
home to work as compensable hours. Considering traffic and the
insufficiency of public transportation, most laborers, especially those
marginalized, are forced to spend more time outside of the home.

It is an exhausting life to live, indeed, one that chips away at the
soul.

### Concerns on e-trikes and e-bikes

Some transport groups want the government to investigate the "rising
number of e-trikes" that are unregulated. Some of the arguments of these
transport groups against e-trikes:

- that they need not be registered nor their drivers are required to
  have license (as per Republic Act [RA] 11687 or Electric Industriy
  Development Act [EVIDA]);
- that their drivers/operators operate as unregulated and unofficial
  public transpo ("colorum") and would sometimes ask for
  higher-than-usual fare, usually to forego the need to queue on
  designated Tricycle Operators and Drivers Association (TODA) stops and
  waiting sheds, thus saving time.

In my opinion, these are valid reasons, but they center only the
livelihood of trike drivers and operators.


## Facing Risks

Almost daily do we, commuters and workers alike, face traffic jams.

### What are [some of] the risks?

- Unsafe sidewalks, if any at all;
- Non-standard overpass infrastructure;
- No covered stops and waiting sheds;
- Unpredictability of road traffic;
- unreliability of public infrastructure;
- Poor public infrastructure hinders mobility for vulnerable road users,
  especially senior citizens and people with disabilities (PWDs))
