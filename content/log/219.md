- Started a new project, [*Each day poking*](/edp).

What does one have to do to be good at something?

Many people said it's consistency, and I tend to agree.

*EDP*, then, is my attempt to slightly improve my writing chops. At the
very least, it's another creative outlet for which I must show up for
a month, at least that's what I tell myself.
