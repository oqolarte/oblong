It would take some time to un-feel my annoyance towards the color teal,
however objectively cool it looks.
The reason for that is,
we've just moved out of an apartment complex
whose indoor and outdoor walls are in that color *all through out*.

If you need visuals, look at the photos of Day 1 -- 3 [here](/feb2022-photos).

Imagine living in it for some two to three years.

Now, we're back to the [old house](/feb2022-photos/#day-19),
back to the heart of a city,
where it's nice and quiet,
apart from the campaign jingles of numerous candidates running for office.
