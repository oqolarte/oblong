      <title>Love your enemies</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/257/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 05:02:48 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/257/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited the front-matter script in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/wiki-meta&#34;&gt;Wiki&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mass was organized at the Baclaran church yesterday for the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/216&#34;&gt;desaparecidos&lt;/a&gt; which my partner and I attended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s way past midpoint of Pebrero 2025, and most of my time is spent in
solidarity with people I care for in some way. Sometimes, it means going
to a different city, listening to a homily, even though I haven&amp;rsquo;t
considered myself a practicing Catholic Christian for a long, &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt;
time. To make up for this lack of faith, we settled on being present in
whatever homily we could attend, and rank and review all the homilies in
an unwritten list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Sunday&amp;rsquo;s main message was &amp;ldquo;Love your enemies,&amp;rdquo; from the gospel of
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%206%3A27-38&amp;amp;version=NIV&#34;&gt;Luke 6:27-38&lt;/a&gt;,
which might well be one of, if not &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt;, highest forms of
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/transformative-justice&#34;&gt;transformative justice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The priest who gave the homily synthesized this to an earlier
reading of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bible.com/bible/116/1CO.15.45-58&#34;&gt;1 Corinthians 15:45-58&lt;/a&gt;, particularly
about how we are first &amp;ldquo;earthly&amp;rdquo; creatures before becoming &amp;ldquo;heavenly&amp;rdquo;
ones. He said (non-verbatim):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liking someone is earthly. Loving someone is &lt;em&gt;supernatural&lt;/em&gt;, that is
heavenly. It is okay to dislike someone because of differences: in
beliefs, personalities, politics, etc. But to hate someone is also
supernatural and in fact &lt;em&gt;evil&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s almost poetic in how the priest tried to explain in as simple an
English as he can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had to guess, maybe love and hate don&amp;rsquo;t exist in other life forms,
so these two complex states of becoming is not natural to them, but
don&amp;rsquo;t quote me on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, these two readings can have more secular interpretations,
which honestly can be twisted by &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/social-engineering&#34;&gt;social engineers&lt;/a&gt; to manipulate other people, or to justify problematic behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, I will remain with my earthly, natural space here and now, where
I can try to practice transformative justice, because at this point,
loving your enemies is nigh impossible. I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine how it must be
for the families of the desaparecidos.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Valentine&#39;s funk</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/256/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 06:20:56 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/256/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minor aesthetic and link updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;to-edgar&#34;&gt;To Edgar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was mulling about my relatively brief interaction with you, Edgar. I
lit an incense to mark the occasion, and there by your spot in the
garden I staked it. My descent to unnamed pits had begun when my solace
was transmuted to a golden feeling that whispered good memories and
showed me the depths of such bosom and kindness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, Eddie Boy, I think of your silliness and how you were gone
too soon. I have not catered to a huge cast of cats in my life so far,
but no one has come close. Maybe that is an unfair assessment for the
others, but you showed me that love and friendship can be deeper than we
were initially led to believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;household-funk&#34;&gt;Household funk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one can hear the summons of the void but, feel the surrounding parts
maybe. Is this it? This hollow feeling despite the good food, good
company. The emptiness is neither harmful event nor is it anything
really other than that&amp;mdash;blank space, no mind of its own, without doubt
and sinister. Yet here we are. Trying to make sense of what is or is
not. In addressing we arrive at a grey area, something tangible that we
can accept for now, because it definitely is much better than the
&amp;ldquo;chicken mami&amp;rdquo; without the chicken!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This funk reminds me of that Valentine&amp;rsquo;s day from 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;valentines-day-2019&#34;&gt;Valentine&amp;rsquo;s day, 2019&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the drafts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a slew of terrible things happening today, partly because of me,
mostly because of the world around me (of course!), I have been feeling
down for the most part of the day, with sad tears even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope I didn&amp;rsquo;t put that lightly for the future readers of this note; I
am capital-T &lt;em&gt;Truly&lt;/em&gt; down. I would&amp;rsquo;ve said Depressed, but I&amp;rsquo;m not
qualified to diagnose myself as such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to hope for better days ahead, but the days ahead include the
midterm elections,&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and we know we Filipinos are about to get drilled
again by &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/empire&#34;&gt;those in power and/or capable now of purchasing it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timely coincidence! So-called Philippines will have another
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Philippine_general_election&#34;&gt;midterm election this coming May 2025&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Grey skies affect moods</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/255/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 05:15:08 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/255/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Done reading a book and added it to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/books&#34;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s about the
on-going conflict on &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/palestine&#34;&gt;Palestine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s bad to preset the day&amp;rsquo;s mood and leave it at that state. Our
emotions need not be fixed; they can be fluid. This I need to remind
myself as I wonder why we are having grey skies mid-February as if we&amp;rsquo;re
somewhere cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Has Europe somehow found the tech to control the weather and ventured
into atmospheric colonialism and begun summoning gloomy clouds in
tropical countries&amp;rsquo; skies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just kidding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The singular benefit of having grey skies is that it&amp;rsquo;s cool enough to
take a nap in the afternoon. But when I take naps in the afternoon, I
only fall half asleep. It has happened many times now. I might have
picked up this quirk when I was still working remotely, here at home.
After eating lunch, while still on break, I would try to nap. There were
naps that got me full rested. But mostly, I was half-snoozing,
half-palpitating, the latter an effect of anxiety of having to go back
to grind at 1pm (or thereabouts). This anxiety was why I could not fully
submit myself to that sweet afternoon nap. It happened enough times
that my body thought I was building a habit, so it stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As grey skies become night-black, I dwindle into a sunken mood that&amp;rsquo;s
both familiar and dank. I roll on and off surreal moments as I function
to, say, prepare a meal for the household.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I look at a screen, I am fooled by the horror and Horror that is
the infinite AI slop that overwhelms digital channels. And yet that same
feeling&amp;mdash;particularly this time, of being comforted by recycled
philosophy. I either fight it or ride it out.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Discombobulate!</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/254/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 00:36:37 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/254/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I rewatched &lt;em&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/em&gt; films directed by Guy Ritchie,
and I have to jot down my thoughts about it. For
the record, I like the second one a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am rereading some
texts of the canon authored by Doyle, although it&amp;rsquo;s likely I won&amp;rsquo;t go
through all of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have now grown more mature and acquired more perspectives with which
to examine the roles of detectives since I last saw the movies many
years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;role-of-detectives&#34;&gt;Role of detectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way I see it, detectives, even of Holmes&amp;rsquo;s caliber, deliver justice
via state&amp;rsquo;s police into the prison industrial complex. As a &amp;ldquo;consulting
detective,&amp;rdquo; untangling knots in cases was Holmes&amp;rsquo;s means of earning an
income. Both
directly and indirectly, he had been state&amp;rsquo;s agent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On at least one story, &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eastoftheweb.com/short-stories/UBooks/FinaProb.shtml&#34;&gt;The Final Problem&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;the
one in which he met Professor Moriarty&amp;mdash;did Holmes take justice into
his own hands but not without risking his life. In the real world, do we
need to lose [a part of] ourselves just to get/give what we all deserve,
to not contend with more evil roaming and modifying our realities?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that modern-day evil draws its power from the current systems of
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/empire&#34;&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;. So maybe, if we desire to reduce the amount of evil
in this world, we need to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/prefiguration&#34;&gt;work on dismantling the Empire now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-want-to-see&#34;&gt;What I want to see&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I don&amp;rsquo;t claim to be a superfan of detective fiction, so I&amp;rsquo;m not
sure about its diversity out there, but I hope there would be more out
there with justice-seeking plot device that
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/transformative-justice&#34;&gt;transforms&lt;/a&gt; rather than
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/abolition&#34;&gt;incarcerates&lt;/a&gt; or, worse, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/destruction&#34;&gt;annihilates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More wishlist for detective fiction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;has no deaths;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;has BIPoC non-men as major characters;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is not just set in Global North;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;has major characters without any harmful addictions;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;doesn&amp;rsquo;t involve violating personal liberties (e.g., &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/privacy&#34;&gt;privacy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/security&#34;&gt;security&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;has sleuthing with the goal of keeping people &lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt; of jails&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-politics-of-detection&#34;&gt;The politics of detection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice how police departments don’t care about crime. Or if they do,
it&amp;rsquo;s to justify the incentives they are taking from taxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They don&amp;rsquo;t care even
in the colloquial sense of “antisocial acts hurt people.&amp;quot; Not even in
the legal sense of “acts that politicians don’t approve of” like in
Duterte&amp;rsquo;s brutal &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/drugwar&#34;&gt;war on drugs&lt;/a&gt; which claimed the lives of
many Filipinos, including innocent ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police departments go after criminals, sure, but criminals who do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;
belong to their group. Unsurprisingly at this point, they &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; go after
innocent people who don’t belong to their group. Oddly, they also go
after their own kind if said kind happens to be a &amp;ldquo;good cop,&amp;rdquo; just like
in the case of Houston Tipping of Los Angeles Police Department. And
most importantly, they protect criminals who belong to their group. For
more info, see the following links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hacktibista PH&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://hacktibista.ph/abuses&#34;&gt;list of PNP &amp;amp; AFP&amp;rsquo;s Abuses, Brutality, Impunity, Human Rights Violations and Alleged State-Sponsored Killings and Violence&lt;/a&gt;, latest on 2021 but obviously continues up to today&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Houston Tipping&amp;rsquo;s murder: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.npr.org/2022/10/08/1127580159/houston-tipping-lapd-death-lawsuit&#34;&gt;An LAPD officer who was killed in a training exercise was targeted, a lawyer alleges&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Their group&amp;rdquo; is as large as the ruling class and as personal as
able-bodied cisgender heterosexual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under capitalism and authoritarianism, we can observe that skilled
workers, including investigators of all types, are kept underpaid,
under-resourced, and in unappreciated positions. Meanwhile, people in
the Higher Ups promote unjust authority to keep us and even their own in
check. If there ever was a motion to investigate any abuses of power,
purging the ranks would be deemed necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;some-detectives-in-fiction-ive-liked&#34;&gt;Some &amp;ldquo;detectives&amp;rdquo; in fiction I&amp;rsquo;ve liked&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(That is, those that don&amp;rsquo;t have Sherlock Holmes in them, and possibly
stretch the job description of what a detective actually does.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, going back now to the fiction. I like it the way I like
reggae&amp;mdash;usually I stick to the really good ones, which I admit is
highly subjective. And even then, not always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;disco-elysium&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disco Elysium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://fitgirl-repacks.site/disco-elysium/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disco Elysium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a role-playing, dialogue-heavy video game, about two
detectives solving a crime. I really like this one, and meant to do more
than one playthroughs, if only my PC then did not die on me. Then again,
the main character doesn&amp;rsquo;t inhibit himself from entering
self-destruction as he and his partner goes around the city looking for
answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;twin-peaks&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twin Peaks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Peaks&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twin Peaks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (TV series by David Lynch) offers another flavor of detective
fiction, this time laced with &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/surrealism&#34;&gt;surrealism&lt;/a&gt; and absurd amounts of good
diner coffee. I only finished Season 1 many years ago. With Lynch&amp;rsquo;s recent
passing, I ought to see the whole thing to the end, &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The catch: the main character is, uhm, a literal state agent (from FBI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hannibal-lecters-universe&#34;&gt;Hannibal Lecter&amp;rsquo;s universe&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have only seen &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Silence_of_the_Lambs_(film)&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Silence of the Lambs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (1991 film), &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dragon_(2002_film)&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Red Dragon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
(2002 film), and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_(TV_series)&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hannibal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Season 1, 2013).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all them, catching the bad guys require the investigators to work
with a criminal, a literal cannibal at that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lie-to-me&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lie to me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_to_Me&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lie to me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; gives us a
consultant/scientist that, alas, works for investigators in solving
crimes through his work in applied psychology. I have only seen Season
1, but I heard it gets better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;scooby-doo-and-the-gang&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scooby-doo&lt;/em&gt; (and the gang)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve only ever watched &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; episodes of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scooby-Doo,_Where_Are_You!&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; cartoon
at Cartoon Network back when it was cooler (for me).
It&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of kids and their big dog getting into sticky
situations with white weirdos (mostly men, if I remember correctly) who
like to cosplay freaky creatures.
The kids would unmask the white psycho- and sociopaths
at the end of each episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;possible-real-world-alternatives&#34;&gt;Possible real world alternatives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imagine that sleuthing may be a fulfilling career in this messy,
cobwebby world we humans have shaped for ourselves. ACAB, but also
ideological purity rarely achieves anything. So here
are a few possible alternatives that attempts to find a balance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Private investigators would refuse to be mercenaries for state&amp;rsquo;s law
enforcement agents. They also wouldn&amp;rsquo;t work with criminals which, I
guess is already mostly addressed if they didn&amp;rsquo;t work for the state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A community of &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/osint&#34;&gt;open source intelligence&lt;/a&gt; enthusiasts and
experts uncover war crimes of a rogue nation, collaborating over
internet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investigative journalists foil the harms being done by Empire, like
human trafficking, modern slavery, genocide, environmental
catastrophes, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A group of teens, as part of their neighborhood watch, would go and
find missing pets of people (e.g., old people, people with
disabilities) who might not have the energy to do it themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explore alternative yet radical ways of living with each other, like
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/mutual-aid&#34;&gt;mutual aid&lt;/a&gt;, drastically reducing crime rates, so that
we can step toward obsoleting the empire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to shoot me an email if you think of more, and I&amp;rsquo;ll add them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Recent local crimes vs street fur</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/253/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 04 Feb 2025 04:57:03 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/253/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I ramble not on &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/animal-liberation&#34;&gt;animal liberation&lt;/a&gt;, although I wish I had the decency to
do so. Instead, I share the latest happenings in our neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;city-pound-visits&#34;&gt;City pound visits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MONDAY&amp;mdash;We take it seriously when the neighborhood dogs
bark in chorus. Something bad is happening. We check it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;City pound pays a visit, and almost right away at least one dog is
shrieking. Pierces the quiet street. Dogs in other houses howl in
unison, worried of the imminent danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learn the dog&amp;rsquo;s humans themselves have summoned the city pound and
given their own pet away to &lt;em&gt;die&lt;/em&gt;. Along with the dog, they also give
away their cat who &amp;ldquo;doesn&amp;rsquo;t tire of giving birth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is heartbreaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;City pounds are known to be brutal and inhumane towards the animals
impounded there. Many of them are malnourished, exposed to weather
elements, and suffering from dehydration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To decongest the animal population, a city pound can legally euthanize
their incarcerated animals, the most &amp;ldquo;humane&amp;rdquo; way of which is through
barbiturates. And as I know it, they regularly decongest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life goes on for the family that surrenders their pet to the city pound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city pound goes on to visit other areas to impound other families&#39;
animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dark-green-car&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Dark green car&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TUESDAY, the following day&amp;mdash;I have just washed my face when I hear a
commotion outside. These words stand out, in Filipino: &amp;ldquo;cat&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;got
hit&amp;rdquo;. As someone who lives with a cat, panic kicks me into dashing out
the street to meet my neighbors. That&amp;rsquo;s when I see him, lying on his
side, still handsome in my opinion despite being a victim of hit-and-run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was not one of our cats, but Thor&amp;mdash;I ask for his name from the
humans who have cared for him&amp;mdash;had visited us. Thor would cause
harmless mischief during his trips to our garden or rooftop. Looking
back, he should be named Loki, but his meows could indeed be thunderous,
especially recently that he seemed in heat. We had called him Mocha
after the blend of colors of this Siamese cat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mocha-Thor&amp;rsquo;s humans agree that we lay him in our garden next to our
banana sprout where he will be shaded. Giving him dignity is the least
we can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an opportunity to be &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/community&#34;&gt;in solidarity with our local community&lt;/a&gt;, to offer what we can even if it is just ample
space to grieve and be angry. Mocha-Tor does not deserve a violent way
to go; this community does not deserve injustice like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This to my kin I do convey. &amp;ldquo;Linger not on anger,&amp;rdquo; they say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lies go on, I thought, as I adapt them to still my nerves. Malice cannot
be everyone&amp;rsquo;s default. Idiocy on the other hand can and does take
lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;epilogue&#34;&gt;Epilogue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suffering does not end. We can only do what we can.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Memes and Books</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/252/</link>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added a finished book in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/books&#34;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;brief-review-of-filipino-value-system&#34;&gt;Brief review of &lt;em&gt;Filipino Value System&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Filipino Value System&lt;/em&gt; is a dense research book by Filipino
anthropologist F. Landa Jocano. In my opinion, it&amp;rsquo;s a good
anthropological report on &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/filipino-values&#34;&gt;Filipino values&lt;/a&gt; and how
the research examines each positively, while still being grounded by
real life examples. It also includes insights from respondents that the
author has interviewed in this decades-long study. With topics
synthesized clearly and concisely, it becomes, like I said, a dense book
that in my opinion is a must-read of Filipinos and Filipinx diaspora who
might be questioning their identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;embrace-the-barbell&#34;&gt;Embrace the barbell&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When taking in information from the world, why not &amp;ldquo;embrace the
barbell&amp;rdquo;? That is, choose the very short or very long formats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was an idea proposed by Millie Tran in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.niemanlab.org/2024/12/embrace-the-barbell/&#34;&gt;her entry for Predictions for Journalism 2025&lt;/a&gt;. She said, &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s time to abandon middling stories&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to explore this proposition but I want to go outside of
journalism and to the wider arena of&amp;hellip;information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m thinking memes for the very short format, and books (both fiction
and non-fiction, preferably printed ones) for the very long. I guess
articles, essays, and blog posts would fall somewhere in the middle&amp;hellip;
but I won&amp;rsquo;t&amp;mdash;can&amp;rsquo;t&amp;mdash;abandon them; just &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; deprioritized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already started a meme group chat in which we would drop only memes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the books, my personal target is to just read more than I did
last year (10 books for 2024). I already finished two this month of Jan
2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the month of Jan 2025, I managed to only listen to one album,
because like I said, I&amp;rsquo;m giving more time to reading books. That means
listening to muzak has been put on the side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Album Name&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Artist&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;HIT ME HARD AND SOFT&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Billie Eilish&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good album to start the year, nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Two-hour messenger dream</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/251/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 12:27:59 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/251/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;And by messenger, I mean the one, who picks up a package from point A
and delivers it to point B on a fixed-gear bike. Definitely NOT the
Facebook messaging app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, my partner and I have decided to sell some of the
physical books that we won&amp;rsquo;t be reading anymore. Instead of just
collecting dust here, it&amp;rsquo;s for the best to rid the space of them with
the bonus of earning small cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since setting up the virtual shop at
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.carousell.ph&#34;&gt;Carousell&lt;/a&gt;, we have made a few successful
sales of our pre-loved books. I&amp;rsquo;d just like to record this particular
run of making several trips around the district, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/50&#34;&gt;riding on my (t)rusty bike&lt;/a&gt;.
I was essentially our own e-shop&amp;rsquo;s bike messenger for the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1st-stop-residential&#34;&gt;1st stop: Residential&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First drop of the morning was at a residence within 2-km radius of our
house. I offered to personally deliver the book to this client, who I&amp;rsquo;d
wager works in a creative industry, for
free to save on shipping fee. Traffic was light. I felt safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2nd-stop-bank&#34;&gt;2nd stop: Bank&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needed to drop by the bank to withdraw cash from ATM. Still, traffic was
relatively calm, because it&amp;rsquo;s already past rush hour. But the sun was
getting higher, and the day hotter. Not banking on the forecast that
weather would be cold until March 2025 at this rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3rd-stop-lbc&#34;&gt;3rd stop: LBC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next stop was at a local &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lbcexpress.com/&#34;&gt;LBC&lt;/a&gt; branch to
drop books bound for Cebu. I might have been an early customer because
they had no change for my payment. I had to go back to the bank that I
had just been to (which is just across the adjacent intersection, so
it&amp;rsquo;s not far; inconvenient, though) to withdraw more cash, but this
time in lower denomination. After completing the transaction at the LBC,
I overheard some of the employees talking about how LBC is
closing some of their branches, likely including this one, as a &amp;ldquo;business
decision.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4th-stop-jt-express&#34;&gt;4th stop: J&amp;amp;T Express&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth and final stop was a bit circuitous to get to from my last point.
It doesn&amp;rsquo;t help that I tend to not have a robust mental cartography. But
I got at this &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jtexpress.ph/&#34;&gt;J&amp;amp;T Express&lt;/a&gt; branch to drop
the last book bound for Pampanga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must say, their customer service is NOT good at all, to put it mildly.
They weren&amp;rsquo;t rude to me or anything like that; but it&amp;rsquo;s as if interacting with me was not prioritized for some reason despite being the only customer there.
Also, I had to install their app,
which as of writing is &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jtexpress.PhClient&amp;amp;hl=en&#34;&gt;rated by many only 2.7 stars out of 5 in Google Play&lt;/a&gt;,
just to avail their service. I had to confirm this with the clerk in front
of me to make sure I got that right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why do I have to do that when I&amp;rsquo;m already
physically here at the store?&amp;rdquo; I thought. It&amp;rsquo;s like those restaurants
whose menu one can only access by scanning their QR code.
Contrary to the trend among business owners, forcing people to interact
with smartphones to avail the products/services doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily
improve the customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lessons-learned-today&#34;&gt;Lessons learned today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personally delivering books is fun and worth the ride. Apart from
walking the dog, it&amp;rsquo;s a nice way to get out of the house and get into
neighborhoods that I won&amp;rsquo;t normally find myself in. I would likely
offer personal delivery to other buyers if they&amp;rsquo;re within 3-4 kms our
home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;J&amp;amp;T Express is not even in my list of options for mode of delivery.
Today, I am reminded why.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reviewing the options for mode of delivery, I delisted
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.grab.com/ph/&#34;&gt;Grab&lt;/a&gt; (and would likely not use it anymore
for personal errands) because &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://pcij.org/2025/01/19/grab-joyride-get-express-admit-making-drivers-absorb-passenger-discounts/&#34;&gt;Grab, JoyRide, GET Express admit to making their drivers absorb passenger discounts&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;rdquo;
according to a recent investigative report by PCIJ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Skin in the game</title>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finished NNT&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Skin in the Game&lt;/em&gt; and added it to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/books&#34;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;brief-review-of-skin-in-the-game&#34;&gt;Brief review of &lt;em&gt;Skin in the Game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taleb has many interesting ideas which may have likely come from
synthesizing different ancient and contemporary wisdoms with his own
personal life changing experiences. He offers, per usual, many insights
in this book, on which I gave &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/skin-in-the-game&#34;&gt;my own reflections&lt;/a&gt;.
He remains philosophical and sharp, especially against people and
institutions that need to be culled by such sharpness. While
self-professed &amp;ldquo;libertarian&amp;rdquo; I wonder if he&amp;rsquo;s on the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; side of the
political spectrum&amp;hellip; not that it matters. It got a bit boring for me
towards the end. I &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; reread this again in the future, though.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sometimes, loneliness</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/249/</link>

      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/249/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DNF &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/books/#did-not-finish&#34;&gt;Olivia Laing&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Lonely City&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reflections-on-the-lonely-city&#34;&gt;Reflections on &lt;em&gt;The Lonely City&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have decided to not finish Olivia Laing&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Lonely City&lt;/em&gt; despite
the lovely prose. I do have some thoughts on some of the things
mentioned there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some nights ago, I plucked this dusty book from a dusty shelf.
Somewhere, I heard a lively discussion of a family as they prepared for
an important meeting the following morning. With the scene going on in
the background, I was drawn to this book of loneliness, but
unfortunately, not for long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On English language&lt;/strong&gt;: Can there even be &amp;ldquo;mutilations of English
language&amp;rdquo; when it itself is tapestry of severed parts from many other
languages? It&amp;rsquo;s hard to mutilate what refuses to be whole. At least, we
can all agree that it&amp;rsquo;s alive and mutating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On sameness&lt;/strong&gt;: Sameness of things is reliable, but it must be limited
to utilitarian purposes only. I don&amp;rsquo;t want everything and everyone to
&amp;ldquo;be the same,&amp;rdquo; because that&amp;rsquo;s eventually reaches
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/fascism&#34;&gt;fascism&lt;/a&gt;; but sometimes, I might need &lt;em&gt;the same&lt;/em&gt; quality of
coffee that I drink every morning, but not all coffees need to be the
same! And when I&amp;rsquo;m tired of having the
exact same coffee, I want to be able to change
it, to modify it myself, to add latte art or a dash of cinnamon,
and make it mine: more
humane, more flawed, a bit loved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On troubled past&lt;/strong&gt;: My childhood trauma is far less intense than that
of &lt;a href=&#34;https://wojfound.org/&#34;&gt;David Wojnarowicz&lt;/a&gt;, but the parts that remain fiery burn bright in a
faraway corner of the mind. I understand and have felt abused and
neglected, but the remaining brain cells in me have no way of processing
them the &lt;em&gt;proper&lt;/em&gt; way. For example, unloading a non-trivial fist bump
onto a concrete wall doth produce an audible thump and a pulsating ache.
This is my practice of rage that I must do in secrecy, lest witnesses
find me weird for punching things instead of, evil enemies. At this
point, who dooms me deeper to past other than my being a nostal-junkie?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Wojnarowicz, I was once fascinated in my own myth-making. Who else
best to elevate myself into an enigma? But the endeavor, I would
discover, is tiring. I want to live! Outside myself, out there in the
real world. Soon, I settled with the fact that there are other stories
worth knowing, telling, and sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Early Jan 2025 Report</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/248/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2025 23:03:42 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/248/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Contrary to my initial non-scienitific forecast,
it still feels cold in evenings until the sun rises the following
morning. That&amp;rsquo;s relatively good news for people who lives in the tropics.
According to PAGASA, &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/press-release/170&#34;&gt;La Niña condition is present in the Tropical Pacific,&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;
which might last until March 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this supposed bed weather, though, it&amp;rsquo;s a bit hard to sleep for
various reasons. My circadian rhythm might be out of sync, nor am I
always well-rested when I do finally get some sleep. On top of that,
subconscious thoughts sometimes come
to me without my calling them, with the unintended side effect of
inducing thermal reactions where there shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be&amp;mdash;just another
groove I must ride out sometimes. Dreams are rarely boring so long as
I contain them to myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This restlessness, though, invited a recent anomaly. One night, when
we&amp;rsquo;re about to go out for dinner, I lost my wallet, which comprises
two cards, a few bills wrapped around them, and a paper clip holding them all
together (for reference, see &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/tools&#34;&gt;photo of my daily carry&lt;/a&gt;).
I told my supposed dinner-mates to go ahead without me, as I
would look for my wallet first. As it turns out, I didn&amp;rsquo;t actually lose
it, because it was already in the fromynt right pocket of my I changed
into for the dinner. Imagine how frustrated must I have felt, how down I
went after that panic, because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I swear I already checked my pockets many times, but somehow the shape
of my wallet, its stiffness, its overall feel, did not register on my
hand;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there might be a flaw in how I design my daily carry and how I quickly
and mindlessly stuff them onto my person;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there could be an undiagnosed mental health problem; and/or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;am I choosing realities now?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any of the above do not spell luck for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It could also be just hunger,&amp;rdquo; my partner said. &amp;ldquo;You should&amp;rsquo;ve come
with us on that dinner, and we would&amp;rsquo;ve found your wallet after.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s normal and shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a concern,&amp;rdquo; my siblings said when we
were hanging out, drinking the night (the following night) away, hearing
their silly obsession with
&lt;a href=&#34;https://hellokitty.fandom.com/wiki/Kuromi&#34;&gt;Kuromi&lt;/a&gt; (I&amp;rsquo;m more of a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gudetama&#34;&gt;Gudetama&lt;/a&gt; enjoyer; &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/anti-work&#34;&gt;to each their own&lt;/a&gt;), hacking the systems that try to impose its
rules on us. Fun night, that one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the next day nursing a hangover (HO), not so much. For the most part
of the day, I was attached to the bed, save for going to the toilet to
do business. By evening, I was done with my HO phase, and was mobile
enough to actually go to where we all should&amp;rsquo;ve dined together a few
days prior&amp;hellip; ofc, with my wallet now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ransomed by Love</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/247/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2025 03:23:55 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/247/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added a book to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/books&#34;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;brief-review-of-ransomed-by-love&#34;&gt;Brief review of &lt;em&gt;Ransomed by Love&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect that this memoir of &lt;strong&gt;Tony La Viña&lt;/strong&gt; was written mostly as
record for himself and for those people the author is grateful for
having met them. Nothing wrong with that, but the general reader like
myself might find it hard to relate if they didn&amp;rsquo;t already know him. And
maybe that&amp;rsquo;s the point closing in on itself&amp;mdash;one must know him first to
buy and enjoy and get something out of the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La Viña also shows that politics and spiritual beliefs can and, at least
in his case, do work in tandem. It&amp;rsquo;s because at the core of these
disciplines, politics and spirituality (or more specific to the author&amp;rsquo;s
case, Christianity), lies &lt;em&gt;philosophy&lt;/em&gt;, the love for thinking and
thinking about thinking, which La Viña took for his undergrad and post
grad studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know and have personally met the author in the flesh. He&amp;rsquo;s generally a
likeable person of booming voice and towering height. My partner and I
have always thought of him as a &amp;ldquo;super extrovert.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s no surprise
then that he is able to be so open about his life in this book, a thing
about his that I both admire and will criticize, as you will see below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;more-reflections-on-ransomed-by-love&#34;&gt;More reflections on &lt;em&gt;Ransomed by Love&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In which each paragraph can be considered a standalone thought. I transcribed and edited all of these ntoes from the
marginalia of our copy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On friendship&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
Starting a &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/friendship&#34;&gt;friendship&lt;/a&gt; with someone leaves you both
permanently changed. It&amp;rsquo;s like that saying, &amp;ldquo;One cannot cross the same
river twice.&amp;rdquo; In modern culture, though, people have being canceling
their relationships as though it were subscription service to be toggled
off when no longer useful. While it&amp;rsquo;s not necessarily wrong, I marvel at
how it gets easier to do that nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On state and its violence&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
We can&amp;rsquo;t allow any state to have sole control over &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/violence&#34;&gt;violence&lt;/a&gt;. When we
fight for things like climate justice, of course we want the whole thing
going down as peaceful as possible. But the State would not hesitate to
get back at us, to force us in to a corner, and harm us for not wanting
the status quo they&amp;rsquo;ve propped up. When that happens, what then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to suffer in joy? The author seems to think so, and maybe
even &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/joyful-militancy&#34;&gt;be militant about it&lt;/a&gt;, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t the wisdom
to get it and do that yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like how the author, after talking about &lt;em&gt;kampanyang ahos&lt;/em&gt;, the
Communist Party of the Philippines&amp;rsquo; (CPP) bloody purging of suspected deep
penetration agents (i.e., infiltrators, &amp;ldquo;government spies&amp;rdquo;), he casually
inserts the word &amp;ldquo;deception,&amp;rdquo; perhaps implying that it has been core
mantra on which CPP has operated since its founding in 1968.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of giving up solitude, why not find it, as a form of solidarity,
with people you love? Sometimes, my partner and I would
read our own books in silence as we are winding down for the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On mining&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
La Viña &amp;ldquo;believed&amp;rdquo; (as in past tense) that &amp;ldquo;mining, when done right&amp;rdquo;
could be sustainable, a version that I&amp;rsquo;m interested in knowing more of.
The way I see it, though, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/refuse&#34;&gt;we have everything we need right now&lt;/a&gt;, and
won&amp;rsquo;t be needing to mine for rare earth metals for many, many years. But
my vision would require &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/simple-living&#34;&gt;drastic life style changes&lt;/a&gt; for a lot of us,
especially the elite class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On odd parenting&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Revolutionary&amp;rdquo; songs are an odd choice for lullabying a newborn. And
also why was going home by midnight daily okay when the author&amp;rsquo;s wife
had just given birth? At one point, La Viña, the frequently flying jet-setting
environmental activist lawyer, claims to be a hands-on father with his
children, while simultaneously admitting to not be the primary
caregiver, in less than a page. It&amp;rsquo;s weird how domestic labor works, &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to La Viña, student leader &lt;a href=&#34;https://bantayogngmgabayani.org/bayani/lean-alejandro/&#34;&gt;Lean Alejandro&lt;/a&gt; would
have been &amp;ldquo;a senator or even a presidential candidate&amp;rdquo; if he were not
assassinated. But do we need him to be a politician? Who&amp;rsquo;s to say that
aiming for a government position wouldn&amp;rsquo;t corrupt him? In the wise words of the
anarchist thinker Malaginoo, I would suggest La Viña to &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://crimethinc.com/2020/12/29/kill-your-heroes-a-filipino-anarchist-discussion-about-national-heroes&#34;&gt;Kill your heroes&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can a set of &amp;ldquo;legal tools,&amp;rdquo; most likely created and written by and for
colonial and national laws, be even of help in liberating indigenous
peoples (IP)? I also find it odd&amp;mdash;&lt;em&gt;bizarre&lt;/em&gt;, as in it reeks of
colonialism if there&amp;rsquo;s no other context &lt;em&gt;bizarre&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;that a certain
American Professor Owen Lynch once taught Philippine Indigenous Law to
the Filipino Tony La Viña.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author hints that the Department of Environment and Natural
Resources (DENR) &lt;em&gt;has supported&lt;/em&gt; businesses like oil and gas,
mining, and logging, all of which require needless destruction of
nature. But, I&amp;rsquo;m not surprised to hear this; DENR is known not
as a regulating body, but as a facilitator to accelerate the
putting up of such businesses that harm large swathes of natural
resources. Meanwhile, why were/are lawyers getting into environmental and energy
sectors?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with progressives like La Viña in DENR could not have stopped the
institution from issuing Environmental Clearance Certificates (ECCs) to
projects that ultimately disrupts the wilderness of sites, if any,
and/or displace the communities living there. I agree with La Viña that
ECCs must only be granted, if at all, after environmental and social
conditions have been addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On swimming in cesspool&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
Then and now, government officials have a
knack for swimming in cesspools, literally. From the archive of The Economist,
&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20230725122753/https://www.economist.com/asia/1997/07/17/the-island-that-became-too-popular&#34;&gt;The island that became too popular&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;rdquo;
then Tourism Secretary Mina Gabor &amp;ldquo;went to Boracay [which had had its waters terribly polluted by local establishments] and took a swim&amp;rdquo; to assure tourists, who were already
canceling their bookings in the island, that the waters were clean. Over
to France last 2024, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/17/paris-mayor-anne-hidalgo-fulfils-olympic-promise-swim-in-the-seine-cleanup-pollution&#34;&gt;Paris mayor swims in Seine as river is cleaned up just in time for Olympics&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;quot;
not long after which &lt;a href=&#34;https://apnews.com/article/2024-olympics-seine-river-illness-02d937f2d5f0fd20efafbf2250264aea&#34;&gt;three German open water swimmers fall ill after Olympic races in the Seine River&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;.
What I&amp;rsquo;m getting at is: if so-called leaders want to literally take a
bath in dirty waters, let them have it, but don&amp;rsquo;t force the activity to
others!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funny lines: Rolly Peña, a &lt;a href=&#34;https://penarroyo.com/about-atty-pe%C3%B1arroyo/f/rolly-pe%C3%B1a-the-revolutionary-as-a-geologist&#34;&gt;revolutionary geologist&lt;/a&gt;,
was asked to join the DENR to work with La Viña, as he had &amp;ldquo;just
surfaced after a decade of working in the underground&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; So, did he
emerge from the physical or political underground? Or was he the
resident geologist for CPP, and did he emerge from a CPP&amp;rsquo;s base&amp;rsquo;s
underground? So much unearthed material there that rocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Paris agreement&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
In reality, the Paris agreement made no significant movement globally,
The &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/capitalism&#34;&gt;capital only heeds growth&lt;/a&gt;, and it demands more resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On having international conferences regarding climate change&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
My naive mind only brings me to this thought: what is the purpose of
this annual meeting of frequent flyers when they achieve basically
nothing? Perhaps they have not heard about &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/direct-action&#34;&gt;direct action&lt;/a&gt;,
and how its
effects starts from the ground up? Perhaps delegates are deluded into
thinking they can bring about change through all this talk? I &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to
understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On governments&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
Throughout this memoir, the author says that the government can be
reformed. I&amp;rsquo;m roughly half his age, and even that&amp;rsquo;s naive for me. States
will continue to work with capital, unless both of them are
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/abolition&#34;&gt;abolished&lt;/a&gt;. For an archipelago as complex and diverse as
the so-called Philippines, it&amp;rsquo;s arrogant to claim that a[ny] school of
government (such as that found in Ateneo, where the author has taught)
could hope to provide the framework for solving this nation&amp;rsquo;s multitude
of problems. Plus, I see no wisdom in uniting the whole of
Philippines&amp;mdash;or any nation for that matter. Of course, we can all live
in peace and harmony and not choose to be at war with one another; but
to be forced to like each other despite the obvious cultural differences
is a big ask. If we must &amp;ldquo;unite,&amp;rdquo; it is with everyone else in the world,
and it&amp;rsquo;s on the idea that we all deserve to be liberated. If we do care,
if we do internalize the bad effects of both Power and Greed, maybe we
would realize the need to escape them as a society. I imagine vibrant
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/community&#34;&gt;communities&lt;/a&gt; sharing practical lessons and resources with
others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On US-Iraq invasion&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
I remember when our Grade 5 English teacher, Mrs. Rodriguez, asked us to
write a formal essay about any piece of news at the time. It must be in
the form of an editorial piece. I asked for my dad&amp;rsquo;s help, and he did.
The output would essentially be his mouthpiece expressing his opinions
against US invading Iraq. I recall that our/his main argument was that
the US did it mainly for the oil. Mrs. Rodriguez wondered whether it was
actually me who wrote it. Physically, yes&amp;mdash;the essay needed to be
handwritten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not surprised that a white male, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Drayton&#34;&gt;Bill Drayton&lt;/a&gt;, appropriated a figure not from his own culture, because his sucks, but from one of slightly questionable origins. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ashoka.org/en-ph&#34;&gt;Ashoka&lt;/a&gt;, named after &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashoka&#34;&gt;Emperor Ashoka&lt;/a&gt;, is an American-based nonprofit organization that promotes social entrepreneurship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good work is rarely a product of solitude but of solidarity and
cooperation. We cannot outrun [generational] problems unless we all work
together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On being a Swiftie&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
La Viña and another scholar, &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20200828054153/https://twitter.com/NicoleCurato/status/1299220497675116545&#34;&gt;Nicole Curato&lt;/a&gt;
are both Swifties. I expected more from progressive people, but we have
them instead admiring a billionaire artist who, according to the video
analysis of the YouTube channel Wings of Pegasus, titled &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8rMNMURShM&#34;&gt;Taylor Swift&amp;rsquo;s $2 Billion tour revenue&amp;hellip; for miming?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; she, Taylor
Swift, was miming (i.e., lip syncing) during her last world tour, raking
in insane amounts of dough in so doing. It&amp;rsquo;s doubly weird for La Viña, a
self-proclaimed environmental activist, to admire Swift, one of the
greatest cabon emmissioners of the early 2020s, according to the article of Carbon Carbon Market Watch
&lt;a href=&#34;https://carbonmarketwatch.org/2024/02/13/taylor-swift-and-the-top-polluters-department/&#34;&gt;Taylor Swift and the top polluters department&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On overworking&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
Maybe La Viña didn&amp;rsquo;t know yet the importance of resting, that backing
away from work means recuperating and not necessarily giving up. And
there&amp;rsquo;s nothing wrong with giving up per se. To make lasting change, it
must be constant, which will only happen if we have the energy to
sustain it. Imagine working so hard you not only ignore your own health,
you &lt;em&gt;disrespect&lt;/em&gt; it. Imagine working so hard that while hospitalized, in
Intensive Care Unit no less, battling cancer, you asked for your phone
and then conducted an online class! We need to realize that we can only
serve our communities and be a &amp;ldquo;happy changemaker&amp;rdquo; if we also care for
ourselves in similar intensity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Grab driver rants on PH&#39;s auth-left</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/246/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 05 Jan 2025 00:05:38 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/246/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On the way to a Sunday-filled mall, we had an interesting conversation
with the Grab driver. He broke the ice by pointing out how the two front
wheels of a yellow 80s-or-90s Toyota Corolla dangerously wiggled, as if
they were going to pop off from the axle. I saw it too, worried a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our convo got to a point where the driver opened up being a rebel once,
as in part of the armed struggle the Communist Party of the Philippines
(CPP), New People&amp;rsquo;s Army (NPA). But he left the group many years ago
when it became clear to him that his macho comrades didn&amp;rsquo;t practice what they
preached, even citing anecdotes about how some of them were sexually
assaulting/abusing people with little to no repercussion.
Accountability, I inform the readers, is something that the CPP is
somewhat aware of, but brushes off. Maybe the entire authoritarian left
of the so-called Philippines (or simply CPP and its branches) is
allergic of accountability and justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We thanked the driver when he delivered us safely to the mall.
Inside, we all observed the horde of weekenders flanking the grounds with
us!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MUZAK 2024</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Music this year may have been neglected for number of reasons. By that,
I mean I haven&amp;rsquo;t been exploring music as much as I wanted to, always
resorting to the tunes that, as a nostaljunkie, feel familiar, reliable
to the point where I know a song would soothe me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite that, below is a recap of all the stuff I listened to this year
2024:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/162/#music&#34;&gt;Jan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/169/#music&#34;&gt;Feb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/175/#music&#34;&gt;Mar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/184/#music&#34;&gt;Apr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/195/#music&#34;&gt;May&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/205/#music&#34;&gt;Jul&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/212/#music&#34;&gt;Aug&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/218/#music&#34;&gt;Sep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/231/#music&#34;&gt;Oct&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/237/#music&#34;&gt;Nov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/244/#music&#34;&gt;Dec&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Nicknames</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/244/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Can I give myself a nickname? Doing that always felt weird, especially
that part where I should tell people about it. But we&amp;rsquo;ve been doing
that, in some form, when we think about our usernames in online spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, the meatspace varies wildly from the nethwerweb, obviously;
the culture in one doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily translate [well] into the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2024&#34;&gt;2024&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it&amp;rsquo;s almost the &amp;ldquo;end of the year&amp;rdquo; 2024. But time simply rolls on
to the next, almost seamless if it weren&amp;rsquo;t for the loud cracks of
fireworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many Asian cultures, fireworks are believed to ward the bad spirits
away. Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be funny when these fireworks disappeared the very
person that lit it, because that person is bad?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a more serious yet still in the realm of superstition: I hope the
fireworks instead dispel the idea of hierarchies, and the institutions
with which such hierarchies are made crumble and be no more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the month of Dec 2024, these are the albums I listened to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Album Name&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Artist&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Hunting High and Low&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;a-Ha&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Sa Wakas&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Sugarfree&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Wu-Tang Clan&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

      <title>TOP 3 BOOKS, 2024</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/243/</link>

      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/243/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Of the ten books I have read this year, my top 3 are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/208/#brief-review-of-expect-resistance&#34;&gt;EXPECT RESISTANCE&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://crimethinc.com/&#34;&gt;CrimethInc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/love&#34;&gt;All About Love: New Visions&lt;/a&gt; by bell hooks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/242/#brief-review-of-fermats-enigma&#34;&gt;Fermat&amp;rsquo;s Enigma&lt;/a&gt; by Simon Singh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, I would have more time and/or motivation to read more books
on 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lovely ways to be alone</title>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added a book to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/books&#34;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;brief-review-of-fermats-enigma&#34;&gt;Brief review of &lt;em&gt;Fermat&amp;rsquo;s Enigma&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author Simon Singh makes sure to shine light on the lives of the
mathematicians, even including portraits, starting from Pythagoras, who
have helped Andrew Wiles complete his work on Fermat&amp;rsquo;s Last Theorem.
Also, who knew that some of them had tragic lives for the simple act of
following their passion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s wild that while Wiles willingly wiled away fellow math wallowers as he
worked on this theorem in secrecy for seven years, he didn&amp;rsquo;t left a sour
note of &amp;ldquo;not having enough paper to write proof&amp;rdquo; and promptly die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading the proofs in the Appendix reminded me of my geometry classes
under Mrs. E during third year of my highschool where she taught us hwo
to construct basic mathematical proof for the theorems we used. I recall
that nice feeling when arriving the logical conclusion of a proof, that
clicking of something when it finally makes sense. (Thanks, Mrs. E!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;spending-the-holidays-alone&#34;&gt;Spending the holidays alone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I don&amp;rsquo;t feel lonely which can only be a positive thing. But
more accurately, I haven&amp;rsquo;t been feeling anything recently: just reading,
existing, languishing, from this day to the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend was hospitalized (she is now fine as of writing this) and I
agreed to take in their dog for one night. The dog created a noticeable
imbalance among my furry friends living with me. Everyone was on edge,
including myself; and I needed to be the one who must manage everyone&amp;rsquo;s
disposition? That&amp;rsquo;s interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I biked to Cubao to buy pen refills and go out on a date with myself.
Browsed some non-fictin books, but the store was unusually crowded at
the time, filled with people recommending which ones their friends could
read next. People-watched for a moment while snacking on burrito, before
deciding its better to do it with someone. That&amp;rsquo;s interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;brief-review-of-resist-everything&#34;&gt;Brief review of &lt;em&gt;Resist Everything&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be no news that it took me months after receiving it as a gift
from a friend abroad to get to finishing this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/oscar-wilde&#34;&gt;Oscar Wilde&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;thanks to the scholarship of the author
Kristian Williams in his book &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resist Everything Except Temptation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;is
shown to be a complex character from the Victorian era, one who was born
wealthy, yes, but had evolved into someone who saw the society and state
for what each of them are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the time, Williams lets Wilde tells his own story, but for such
a colorful life, I can&amp;rsquo;t blame the author for inserting his political
insights when necessary to explain something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;more-reflections&#34;&gt;More reflections&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is Christmas season when I finished reading this book. People echo
that it&amp;rsquo;s the time for giving, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think they mean that it&amp;rsquo;s the
&lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; time. Personally, I think of when will I have the
means&amp;mdash;courage, really&amp;mdash; to give &amp;ldquo;big&amp;rdquo; things, in terms of money, good
food, clothing, to people in need without going bankrupt myself. I know
this is a limited way of thinking about how we can help one another, but
we all deserve indulgence sometimes. Right now, it means having the
resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, when I come across the lives of &amp;ldquo;extreme minimalists,&amp;rdquo; I
can&amp;rsquo;t help but notice that many of them come from a place of privilege
who have decided that a life of excess is not worth having. While I&amp;rsquo;m
fascinated by their attempt at ascetism to the point where I ask myself
if I could ever do that lifestyle, I know there is a right balance
between indulging in life&amp;rsquo;s pleasures and &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/simple-living&#34;&gt;living simply&lt;/a&gt;.
I&amp;rsquo;m of the opinion that when we expropriate the excesses of the ruling
class, decadence can be distributed equally so that everyone can
experience it periodically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that note, I wonder whether giving people the luxury versions of
basic necessities for only a limited amount of times would pacify them
or agitate them to demand better living conditions. There is much
discontent among the masses, that much we know. But feeling it is just
first step in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/revolution&#34;&gt;turning everything out of order&lt;/a&gt; to favor,
ultimately, our desires and dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money on its own is not evil. The evil part comes from the accumulation
of wealth, the consolidation of power, and the monopoly of violence by
those who have succeeded in doing so. Crimes exist because of these
imbalances that cause people to be dishonest and wish to harm others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Finished a long novel and added it to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/books&#34;&gt;book list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And other minor design updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;brief-review-of-purity&#34;&gt;Brief review of &lt;em&gt;Purity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This novel is the first work of Jonathan Franzen that I have read. Might
be the last, but I&amp;rsquo;m not one for closing on things permanently. Like
this book, since starting it, I have left it closed many times, for
many, many weeks in a row. It&amp;rsquo;s that boring, honestly. And I&amp;rsquo;m not the
only one; people have the same thoughts on Goodreads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a needlessly thick book about morality that could have
been nicely condensed to maybe &lt;em&gt;69%&lt;/em&gt; of its original word count. I&amp;rsquo;m
chucking in the meme-ified number 69 to entertain myself, because that&amp;rsquo;s
the only fun I could get from reading and reviewing the book. And it&amp;rsquo;s a
nod to the author who has the habit, at least for this meaty text, of
inserting (!) sex stuff in the most literary way he could do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the author is trying too hard for my liking to be clever with
his prose instead of moving the plot along and/or letting the characters
tell their own stories through their [in]actions. Many times, it feels
like going through thick weeds in an already meandering forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I&amp;rsquo;m being honest, the only reason I started reading this was because
on the synopsis, I caught the phrase &amp;ldquo;squatting with anarchists.&amp;rdquo; But
the entire book has no anarchism in it whatsoever. It was just a plot
device, I guess, or a hook where there should not be any.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gray-mornings&#34;&gt;Gray mornings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, mornings have been cool enough to not warrant turning on the
electric fan for the entire night. Was this the case for December last
year?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, light rain would wet the streets, preventing me from walking
the dog in the daytime. I tell Pablo, the dog, that we would walk later
in the afternoon, which is more doable now because of the weather. I
would also prefer walking him when there&amp;rsquo;s still natural light outside,
than in the evenings when the white blinding headlights of cars could
maybe cost our legs or lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;physical-activity&#34;&gt;Physical activity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muay Thai, parkour, calisthenics&amp;mdash;I&amp;rsquo;m wanting so many different
physical activities, those that require the least amount of equipment
and &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; zero gym membership (hard to achieve for learning martial
arts), but only somewhat able to sustain one at this point. How many
&amp;ldquo;sports&amp;rdquo; would be a realistic number to maintain in the long run?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ask that, in spite of a recent mishap the cause/s of which is/are
still vague to me. I had to bandaged my right wrist for a few days
because of a minor pain that had something to do with a tendon or tissue
connecting my right thumb to my wrist. I&amp;rsquo;m fine now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world of power imbalances, abusers tend to monopolize
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/violence&#34;&gt;violence&lt;/a&gt; to get what they want, even if they say that
it &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3nSRcTkQsA&#34;&gt;has no place&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/politics&#34;&gt;politics&lt;/a&gt;. A friend has shifted their
belief on the matter, favoring more and more to utilize violence as one
way to de-escalate. This is because of the obvious worsening of abusers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe, just maybe, being fit, strong, and able to punch up
could indeed stop abusers on their tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, why do I get the feeling that this&amp;mdash;meaning, shaping up&amp;mdash;would
scale up well, from interpersonal to international relationships?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>People watching at a Paresan</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/239/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 13 Dec 2024 05:31:29 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/239/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the Friday the 13th, and I have been thinking about what would have
been &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/second-order-thinking&#34;&gt;second-order&lt;/a&gt; effect if I helped an old
man earlier at an al fresco eatery. But first, let me describe this
Paresan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The place, being in a relatively busy place, attracts different all
kinds of people. And since it&amp;rsquo;s open&amp;mdash;physically and business-wise
operating 24/7&amp;mdash;one is welcome to just sit on whichever stool is
vacant. It&amp;rsquo;s bar-like design could either be conducive of conversations
with strangers or be just a nook where one could be alone, the city&amp;rsquo;s
humdrum as background for one&amp;rsquo;s musings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrons all face the center, a small kitchen island of sorts where the
most common order is prepared, and behind it, the menu. Our usual order
is beef pares, and I&amp;rsquo;m glad the price hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed in a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the customers was already seated, and just parked behind him was
his electric scooter. He seemed to be always gauging his surroundings,
always looking out for his scooter. It is a heavy thing, and I don&amp;rsquo;t
suppose it would just coast without it being turned on first. But I
understand his being aware of the people around him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, a curious old man sat beside him. The old man did not order any
food. Instead, he was curious about the electric scooter which he
surmised belonged to the
younger man. Old man asked younger man questions about it, and
younger man was respectful enough to entertain this whole social
interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cynic in me kept expecting something bad would happen from these two
strangers talking, but it was just that really&amp;mdash;two strangers talking.
About electric scooter. Nothing to overthink. Old man seemed genuinely
curious; younger man seemed respectful. It matters to me to witness
humane interaction out in the field, despite the growing pessimism
in urban jungles, despite my own cynicism. How else can build our
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/community&#34;&gt;communities&lt;/a&gt; if we don&amp;rsquo;t try striking random conversations with random
people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, another old man entered and sat among the diners. He
kept bugging the customers and the servers
for free food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I don&amp;rsquo;t think asking for food is bad. It depends on how
one does it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This old man, in my view, had been spouting vile words when people
didn&amp;rsquo;t give him what he asked for. I say &amp;ldquo;in my view&amp;rdquo; because I could
not understand most of the words he was slurring, and simply inferred
based on the words that I did, and from his and the other customers&amp;rsquo; body
language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I asked one of the servers, she confirmed this is a regular thing
with the [second] old man. She says, &amp;ldquo;Sometimes, customers would buy him food.&amp;rdquo;
But it has turned into a charity, and this old man has been hassling the
eatery for free food, the server added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hunger, at least for me, is never a dignifying feeling. I always wonder
how do those that go hunger strike do it. Hunger is a universal feeling,
too, so I kind of get the bad mood the old man seems to be perennially
in, given his condition. On the other hand, by giving him free food, I
wonder whether I would be enabling his toxic behavior towards the dining
place as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And like most urban cynics, I minded my own business, and told my
partner who was with me the entire time to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Recently, Wk 50 of 2024</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/238/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Dec 2024 04:58:56 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/238/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Done rereading Nassim Nicholas Taleb&amp;rsquo;s book, &lt;em&gt;Antifragile&lt;/em&gt;, which took
more than half a year for me to complete. I &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/antifragile&#34;&gt;took notes this time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/blogroll&#34;&gt;blogroll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me agree with that one internet comment that December already feels
like 18 months in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I have for now are scattered thoughts, many of which are excerpts
from my journal, that I can&amp;rsquo;t weave into a coherent narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With the rise of social media cloning (its threat actors locally known
as &amp;ldquo;posers&amp;rdquo;), if/when I make an account in any one of the biggest
platforms, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to not even include a picture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros prise pros&lt;/strong&gt;, especially when it comes to packing things
efficiently into a tight space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apart from old brutalist buildings in my line of sight, the sky has
been mostly gray recently due to the colloidal mix of urban smog and
volcanic ash, the latter drifting from the mouth of Mt. Taal. Rain
sometimes fall, turning asphalt roads into long strips of obsidian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/politics&#34;&gt;Politics&lt;/a&gt; is all about optics, if we want to be real about
it. Nothing inherently wrong about that. But the question is, how do
we apply the politics into our day to day lives? We want to be seen
doing something for the greater good, yes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I tried visualizing myself hugging a much younger version of me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A recent nightmare had me incensed for being unable to escape from
something or someone determined to home in on me no matter what.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>More thoughts on lounging and dying</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/237/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2024 17:02:17 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/237/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added a new page, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/will&#34;&gt;Will&lt;/a&gt;, inspired by recent events, and by a friend
having their own dedicated page on their website. Of course, I will
continue to update this until I&amp;rsquo;m no longer able to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before anything else, I think that all good things that have happened
to me are mostly because of luck; and many, if not all, of the bad
things are due to my skills, or lack thereof. I hope to change the
second part by more active participation in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;actively-doing-the-bare-minimum&#34;&gt;Actively doing the bare minimum&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just said that I would participate more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s because for many years now, my guiding workflow is the intersection
of &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/68/#on-time&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;wu wei&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, procrastination, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/20&#34;&gt;lethargy&lt;/a&gt;. Not
that it&amp;rsquo;s a good thing to stick to, nor is it a point that I desire to
escape from as soon as possible. I can&amp;rsquo;t help but wonder whether this
trinity might be helping me preserve myself, so that I can continue
fighting for things that matter to me and my loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;owning-anything&#34;&gt;Owning anything&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why bother working hard with the end goal of buying more stuff? If
one must work hard at all, it should be for the betterment of the place
and community one eventually finds themselves in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t even own anything, really. It&amp;rsquo;s true within
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/capitalism&#34;&gt;Capitalism&lt;/a&gt; in which nothing that we have (like house and
the stuff in it) or we do (like thejobs that gets us that paycheck)
belongs to us. Some rich people-in-power somewhere could bend the laws
and take it all away in one, or more realistically, several, swoops.
It&amp;rsquo;s also true in the ecological sense in that, we are just temporary
caretakers of our possessions, and all of it will all go back to the
earth from which many of our stuff we have dug out of. What remains, I
think, it the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/love&#34;&gt;love&lt;/a&gt; we feel &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/health&#34;&gt;for ourselves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/friendship&#34;&gt;for each other&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;thinking-of-death&#34;&gt;Thinking of death&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I witness my partner&amp;rsquo;s family grieve for their matriarch, and I have
thought about my death, too. This lead to the creation of the Will page
on this site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all the commotion surrounding our final resting place, and how even
at death, capitalism still has stranglehold over our bodies, it makes me
consider to have a sea burial instead. As of writing, I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure
whether it&amp;rsquo;s legal here in the archipelago, nor am I bothered yet to
even check this despite my proximity to the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the month of Nov 2024, these are the albums I listened to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Album Name&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Artist&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Tubthumper&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Chumbawamba&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Pictures of Starving Children Sell Records&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Chumbawamba&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Anarchy&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Chumbawamba&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;The Land is Inhospitable and So Are We&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Mitski&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;

      <title>Been to Baguio, Nov 2024, Redux</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/236/</link>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added another &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/books&#34;&gt;finished book in the list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;brief-review-of-dila-at-bandila&#34;&gt;Brief Review of &lt;em&gt;Dila at Bandila&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50913852-lasa-ng-republika-dila-at-bandila&#34;&gt;This is a short book&lt;/a&gt;
that I started reading during &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/235&#34;&gt;our last trip to Baguio&lt;/a&gt;.
It&amp;rsquo;s a compilation of the author&amp;rsquo;s essays on what Filipino food means to
us, Filipinos, and possibly to the rest of the world, whose opinion of
us we are &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; interested in bordering obsession. Ige Ramos also
questions the motives behind the &amp;ldquo;standardization&amp;rdquo; of some well-known
Filipino ulams through echoing the sentiments of food writers and
critiques before him, through many recipes that kind of share the same
structure but differ in ingredients and preparation, and through
personal musings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite essay is the last one in which the author says that if
there should be a national food &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;, it should be the &lt;em&gt;suman&lt;/em&gt;, a
sticky snack that has coconut, rice, and sugar cane as the main
ingredients. Ige Ramos argues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every town in the Philippines, from Batanes to Tawi-Tawi has its
version&amp;hellip; One can enjoy it alone or by many people during events and
ceremonies&amp;hellip; The cooking of suman has nothing to do with &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/religion&#34;&gt;religion&lt;/a&gt; or
faith. Whether one is a pagan, Lumad, Muslim, or Christian, it is
neutral and fair to everyone. It does not discriminate against gender,
age, economic status, or educational attainment. This is the power of
suman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;trying-to-read-more-like-a-grad-student&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trying&lt;/em&gt; to read more like a grad student&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; runs the risk of stumbling into more problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During our Baguio trip, I did a short experiment: instead of pulling out
my phone when bored, I would instead pull out a book and read instead.
This is how I finished a relatively short book in a relatively short
span. I hope to finish more books to maybe offset my lizard brain&amp;rsquo;s
desire to chase &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; shallow feel-good things, which I suspect nudges
me to the lower end of intelligence spectrum each time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s nothing new, really. People have been reading books out and about. But as
smartphones get shinier and more packed with features, we ask
ourselves whether it is practical to carry a physical paper book with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this little experiment introduces another set of problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;do-i-only-bring-smallthinshort-books-for-portability&#34;&gt;Do I only bring small/thin/short books for portability?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good short books, in my experience, are a rare find. I was lucky that we
have a few in our library that I managed to bring for this trip (and
experiment).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After our small, hardbound copy of Mary Shelley&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/em&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;m
not sure what else would be there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scouring for small and worthwile reads, AND scoring a physical copy for
an affordable price might not be a sustainable
endeavor in the long run. Clearly, I need to sit on this more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;do-i-read-just-e-books&#34;&gt;Do I read just e-books?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should I just resort to reading e-books? If so, do I read them from my
phone, or should I get an e-ink reader?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I prefer reading from e-ink displays, to be honest, but since I don&amp;rsquo;t
have any right now, does that mean I would have to get one? I&amp;rsquo;m trying
to reduce the number of screens in my life right now, and buying an
e-ink reader is the opposite of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, there are also considerations like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how hackable is it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is it easy to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/repair&#34;&gt;repair and maintain&lt;/a&gt; when, say, the battery
needs to be replaced?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can I repurpose it to something else in the future?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-about-audiobooks&#34;&gt;How about audiobooks?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easy. I have never been a fan of audiobooks, so I&amp;rsquo;m not even considering
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;undecided&#34;&gt;Undecided&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I am, at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phone stays with me, though, at least right now. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to
fully disconnect either and/or go off-grid, because that is, for me
right now, such a privileged thing to say and do. Plus, having a map
with GPS saves a spatially challenged someone like me who has not
figured out the compass of the world and has no sense of direction
(obviously).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Been to Baguio, Nov 2024</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/235/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 23 Nov 2024 07:41:55 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/235/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/about&#34;&gt;About&lt;/a&gt; page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added new blogs to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/blogroll&#34;&gt;blogroll&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I exist again in a more familiar space after a short break spent in Baguio City
before peak season hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, where I write these words, I am reminded that warmer weather
definitely affects people&amp;rsquo;s behavior. When I returned here, I also
returned to a grumpier self who loses hard to all the subconscious
fights before I&amp;rsquo;m even aware of them. That same self, in a funny turn of
events, forgot to bring the essentials for this very trip. Good thing
that forgetfulness rarely ruins vacations&amp;hellip; to wit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not one of those who annually goes to Baguio. If I had to estimate,
I am only there, on average, every 5 years, each time being a bit more
shocking than the previous one in terms of witnessing the changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my short stay there, I have also observed the following when
participating in the city&amp;rsquo;s transportation network:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motorists yield to pedestrians.&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m sure this happens elsewhere,
but certainly not as much here in Metro Manila. Drivers in Baguio
prioritize pedestrians by giving them all the time and
space they need when crossing the streets. Despite the narrow
sidewalks in many&amp;mdash;and even nonexistent in some&amp;mdash;streets, knowing
this makes the city more walkable, even if its topography can be
unforgiving to plains people like me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drivers give way to other drivers.&lt;/strong&gt; The steep slopes, combined
with sharp turns, can be challenging, even for seasoned drivers.
That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s common courtesy among local drivers to give way to
the other guy whenever possible. This is refreshing to witness for me
who has mostly known the Metro Manila&amp;rsquo;s aggressive, angry, and
reckless drivers. Of whom I am again reminded getting back here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still consider myself a city dweller who needs his daily microdose of
urban white noise. While Baguio is not perfect, its urbanity plus the
cooler climate is what makes it popular. However, I have long since
crossed out the city in my list of possible places where I would settle
for good, if at all. This is out of respect to its citizens, those who
have always been there through its ups and downs. I&amp;rsquo;m sure they don&amp;rsquo;t
need another person from Metro Manila romanticizing their place with
rose-colored glass.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Recent social interactions</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/234/</link>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/foss&#34;&gt;FOSS&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where am I when it matters? In my head, projecting outward, wiring and
rewiring, writing and rewrit(h)ing my life in and out of the void? In
reality, I cannot be everywhere and be everyone. And so choosing which
battles to face has been a lifelong journey, not only for me I&amp;rsquo;m sure,
but for everyone that matters to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been reading &lt;em&gt;Purity&lt;/em&gt; by Jonathan Franzen for many months now.
Even for a slow reader like me, that&amp;rsquo;s a snail pace. The book, for me,
wanders too much, to say the least, but in the meandering forest of
prose&amp;mdash;the only forest safe enough to find sleep&amp;mdash;I found this gem,
which I am paraphrasing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the core of shyness could be a superiority (thus, inferiority)
complex that hinders the person from having a healthy social life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At times when I veer from social interactions, I need to be honest with
myself on the intention behind this choice. Otherwise, it will be a lonely
life ahead of me. For example, when I bought a second-hand Samsung S10e
at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=greenhills+vmall+smartphone&#34;&gt;smartphone area in Greenhills VMall&lt;/a&gt; (YouTube),
I was sure that the density of salespeople there
vying for my attention would quickly drain my social battery. It is
intense over there! Even the most extroverted people should be wary.
In bazaars like this, it&amp;rsquo;s only practical to know exactly what you want
and make it a point to get it as soon as possible, then exit.
One more point, going slightly off tangent, on this used-items bazaars:
Flea markets like this should be a physical reminder that there is
enough stuff to go around for years,
even for things like smartphones, computers, and other consumer
electronic products.
In many cases, we can &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/refuse&#34;&gt;refuse&lt;/a&gt; to buy new stuff!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days after that, we attended a zine making workshop that tackles
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/animal-liberation&#34;&gt;animal liberation&lt;/a&gt;. I chose to fully participate
here, as I thought events like this are great avenues to promote
relevant radical
ideas people might be interested about. After creating our zines,
which was fun in itself, we got to present them to the other
participants. When it was my time to show my work, I managed to
transform to my more outgoing self. I would say that my presentation was
well received. I might write about the contents of the zine I make soon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Emulsyon (2024)</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/233/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 07 Nov 2024 02:12:45 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/233/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We were recently invited to watch two one-act plays combined in one
showing called &lt;em&gt;Emulsyon&lt;/em&gt;, produced by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/apothecaryproductions/&#34;&gt;Apothecary Productions&lt;/a&gt; (Instagram).
As said, it contains two different stories attempting to traverse a
narrative exploring the aftereffects of Martial Law to its families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;loyalist-redux&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loyalist Redux&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Kanakan Balintagos&amp;mdash;Mother and son comes into view quarelling over
the politics that they believe in, and it gets personal. And we have
seen this before, maybe even remembered ourselves in it&amp;mdash;parents
sitting in the opposite site of their kids&amp;rsquo; beliefs. But if either side
would be open to the idea of unpacking the conflict together, a
compromise might be achieved in which no bridges are burned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;indigo-child&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Indigo Child&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Rody Vera&amp;mdash;The direction of play, for me, is more symbolic than
real, yet more visceral in its execution as it tackles the trauma that
state violence have caused against those that oppose the people in
power. State&amp;rsquo;s monopoly of violence not only harms its victims but also
the communities around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;watch-emulsyon&#34;&gt;Watch &lt;em&gt;Emulsyon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are able, see &lt;em&gt;Emulsyon&lt;/em&gt; showing from 08 - 23 NOV 2024. Tickets: &lt;a href=&#34;https://ticket2me.net/event/21941&#34;&gt;https://ticket2me.net/event/21941&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Locally known as &lt;em&gt;Undas&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less than a handful of relatives gathered at the ancestral house to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/173&#34;&gt;remember the deceased&lt;/a&gt; and to allot time to visit their graves
along with hundreds of thousands who marched with us that day within
Manila South Cemetery.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>All Hallows&#39; Eve 2024</title>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/edp/#day-14&#34;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/edp/#day-15&#34;&gt;new&lt;/a&gt; entries to EDP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/foss&#34;&gt;FOSS&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And other minor design fixes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then we reached the end of the month of Oct 2024&amp;mdash;All Hallows&amp;rsquo; Eve,
according to some traditions that do follow it. For most of the
Christianity-influenced world, it&amp;rsquo;s Halloween. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what people
are supposed to face, but we certainly are not a fan of going toe to toe
with real life horrors that continue to hound us every which way we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;each-day-poking&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Each day poking&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/edp&#34;&gt;EDP&lt;/a&gt; is a self-imposed month-long writing exercise meant to document what
is going through my head as I slide willfully into unemployment, at
least for the time being while I recuperate and go back to things that I
enjoy doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is now completed, with 16 entries logged. I initially meant to add
entry everyday, but of course, the real world demands my presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the month of Oct 2024, these are the albums I listened to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Album Name&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Artist&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Harlequin&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Sofie Royer&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;strongboi&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;strongboi&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t had the pleasure of discovering a lot of new muzak that I
would like this month. Next month, maybe?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Found four dead small mammals</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/230/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a day! Including three rats of varying age and size, and one shrew.
All of them I have found in different stages of decomposition, in
corners one would not necessarily expect them unless one follows the
thick rotting smell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a handful of cats and one big dog, all of whom in need of expending
their energy, this has been part of their game:
the sound of fear from tiny squeaking animals and the
smell of death and decay that comes after each of their invisible yet
violent death. Life in the old house is bound to witness its humans
digging graves for the deceased in compost pits, in which the bodies
would hopefully give life back to earth in the city. Our resident flora
has had no choice but to be a de facto cemetery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trimmed Index.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/about&#34;&gt;About&lt;/a&gt; page to include a &amp;ldquo;career identity statement&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added a new entry to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/edp/#day-0&#34;&gt;EDP&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Who&#39;s teaching me to love?</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/229/</link>

      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/229/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/edp/#day-12&#34;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/edp/#day-13&#34;&gt;new&lt;/a&gt; entries to EDP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If reading bell hooks has taught me anything,
it is that &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/love&#34;&gt;choosing love&lt;/a&gt; is a complex maze of reasoning
with myself and the people I have met so far.
It is a strange thing, one that I dare not even describe with limiting
words. I can only feel it in unplottable sinusoids,
especially the last whole six years of it,
with Isya&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; who, statistically speaking, has been with me the most in that
time frame. As of writing, I hope that I get to spend more time with
them, at least, nine more years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We like inside jokes. This post contains one, if &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; can see
it.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Social Good Summit 2024</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/228/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 20 Oct 2024 05:07:58 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/228/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We recently attended a media event by Rappler et al., with the chief
reason being able to see &lt;a href=&#34;https://mastodon.world/@Mer__edith&#34;&gt;Meredith Whittaker&lt;/a&gt; virtually talk to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rappler.com/author/maria-a-ressa/&#34;&gt;Maria Ressa&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/technology&#34;&gt;tech&lt;/a&gt; and
its harms&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here were the panel discussions that we were able to attend that day,
along with some of my grounding questions to future-self:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tech and the education crisis&lt;/strong&gt;: How can we use existing
technologies to help improve the education in the Philippine setting?
How can we make it more accessible to more learners and teachers,
especially in far-flung areas? And with the ongoing AI hype, how can
LLMs be utilized, if needed at all, to assist pedagogues in
facilitating critical thinking among students?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tech and its harms&lt;/strong&gt;: Aside from content moderation, data cleanup,
training large language models, and general tech-related neo-slavery, what
are the other ways that global north tech bros recolonize people from
the global south, including the Philippines?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content creation for a cause&lt;/strong&gt;: Can we actually subvert Big Tech by
using their social media platforms in pushing forward a cause that we
believe in? Can we rely on their algorithms to serve &amp;ldquo;value-adding
content&amp;rdquo; to the audience that needs to see it at the right time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can we make cities climate-resilient?&lt;/strong&gt; Can we rely on the State
and other relevant institutins to &amp;ldquo;election-proof&amp;rdquo; any long-term plans
that could make cities climate-resilient? By making data open and
available to the public, is it possible to make an &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/antifragile&#34;&gt;antifragile&lt;/a&gt;
community?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;climate-resilient-community&#34;&gt;Climate-resilient community&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an activity in one of the breakout rooms, the participants divided
into groups, each tasked to imagine a community that they would like to
live in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a snapshot of a community of the group I was in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/image/park.jpeg&#34;
    alt=&#34;A crude drawing of a dream community, meant to represent the ideals of the individuals who collaborated in making it&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We didn&amp;rsquo;t name this place&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our dream place, among other things, includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a big park in the middle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a road with designated bus stops&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a dedicated, protected bike lane, under which is the drainage system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;school&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;low-cost housing with solar panels on the rooftop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Climate resilient integrated agency&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;high-end housing with solar panels and vertical garden on the rooftop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;animal park&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;processing plant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;composting area&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;urban garden&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maker space&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;material recovery facility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;solar farm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;water reservoir&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;community learning hub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, after we collectively decided we were done with our work,
I overheard from other groups that they &amp;ldquo;should add government
facilities [on their community].&amp;rdquo; Looking at our work, we had none.
Speaking only for myself here, it might be because we felt we didn&amp;rsquo;t
one. Perhaps, subconsciously, my group mates have already started
imagining a life outside of our current prevailing systems.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rabbit holes of the mind</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/227/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Oct 2024 04:59:12 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/227/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/edp/#day-10&#34;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/edp/#day-11&#34;&gt;new&lt;/a&gt; entries to EDP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited list of hardware &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/support&#34;&gt;Support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited the list of &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/foss&#34;&gt;FOSS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;extreme-minimalism&#34;&gt;Extreme minimalism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s weird how rabbit holes lead me to different places, subjecting me
to short but well-received phases in my life. One recent one being
extreme minimalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diving into the lives of those who practice extreme minimalism: I&amp;rsquo;m
always at awe how little the modern person actually needs in order to
live a meaningful life in this world, and yet comfort is a Pandora&amp;rsquo;s
box that not only we can no longer close, the contents of which we are
still exploring and letting loose. I am sure that I won&amp;rsquo;t be as
extreme as these practioners are, not that it&amp;rsquo;s good nor bad. If
anything, they share important lessons in life, particularly about
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/simple-living&#34;&gt;simple living&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;falling-teeth&#34;&gt;Falling teeth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet again, a recent dream quickly became a nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon checking my mouth, because what else is there to do in a dream but
to check one&amp;rsquo;s mouth, I noticed that most of my teeth were loose and
wiggly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the mind is both brilliant and dim: based on historical data, past
dreams that involved falling teeth were, in the grand scheme of things,
nothing to worry about, i.e., I would wake up fine, relatively, mostly, anyway.
I thought of this &lt;em&gt;while in this dream&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, taking this as a an inevitable fact, I grabbed a small container and
onto it I spat my teeth. The rationale was, I would have my dentist fix
them and reattach them to my gums one by blessed one, and that stressing over the whole ordeal was not worth my mental distress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as I began spitting out, though, each tooth crumbled and
splintered into thousands of shards, mixed with blood and spit, all of
which irreperable by even the best of
dentists. I myself began to
break down, losing my wits to a failed plan that was never good to begin
with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I had a few dreams containing strong emotions ending in no resolution.
Where does that leave me?
Aside from wanting closure from such an ephemeral daze, not much.
Don&amp;rsquo;t dreams suppose to mean something apart from just causing unwanted
stirrings?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bike rides for free</title>

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can almost pinpoint with great accuracy and precision the root cause
of what I have been feeling recently, and it has something to do with
the conditions I am finding myself in on an everyday basis; the
environments that shape the spaces that I have to choose not to reshape
back, because reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My recent bike rides have been liberating me from this&amp;hellip; terrible
feeling. The most recent ride is through a torrential downpour, and
despite all that hazardous wetness, I felt free and, with my index
fingers feathering the brake levers, safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Done reading bell hooks&amp;rsquo;s book, &lt;em&gt;All About Love&lt;/em&gt;. Like most non-fiction
I read, I took my time with it. All good things take time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also slowly mulling on what things to do on my upcoming free time.
I told someone close to me that I might do/create things with my hands.
They suggested carpentry. I might just do that.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Breaking the Cycle (2024)</title>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited and improved documentation of &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/alpod&#34;&gt;Alpod&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added an entry to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/edp/#day-5&#34;&gt;EDP&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;thoughts-on--around-breaking-the-cycle-2024&#34;&gt;Thoughts on &amp;amp; around &lt;em&gt;Breaking the Cycle&lt;/em&gt; (2024)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We watched this Thai political documentary directed by Aekaphong
Saransate and Thankrit Duangmaneeporn. It follows
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanathorn_Juangroongruangkit&#34;&gt;Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit&lt;/a&gt;
and the ambition of his party at the time (now dissolved because of a
court ruling) to &amp;ldquo;break the cycle&amp;rdquo; of coups in Thai politics.
Their story shares similarities with the Philippines politics, in that
we are stuck with essentially the same people running the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the screening was a discussion with a panel comprising:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nymia Pimentel Simbulan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tony La Viña&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ferdinand Sanchez&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Karel Jiaan Antonio Galang&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hannah Jimala&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Safe to say that many,
if not most, of the audience come from a progressive politics. The vibe
of the room, from where I was sitting, had not shifted much. As I said,
the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Forward_Party&#34;&gt;Future Forward Party&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s
story
follows a similar trajectory as that of, say,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.angatbuhay.ph/&#34;&gt;Angat Buhay&lt;/a&gt;, the non-government organization that
Leni Robredo and her team launched after her term as vice president
expired, losing the presidential seat last Elections 2022 to the son of
dictator Marcos Sr., Ferdinand &amp;ldquo;Bongbong&amp;rdquo; Marcos Jr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussion mostly revolved around the possible steps we can take to
&amp;ldquo;break the cycle.&amp;rdquo; With politicians gearing up for Elections 2025, the
consensus, I think, can be distilled to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vote wisely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be the change you want to be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Join an organization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with all of them. I just feel the pebble in my boot when
Professor Simbulan twice said the need to &amp;ldquo;conscientize, politicize, and
organize&amp;rdquo; the youth and student sector; and that the only way to affect
change is by joining an organization with a proper structure. To that
latter bit, I disagree. It is a good way, great maybe, but &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the only way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of friends can organize to cook food and feed the houseless in
their community. Housemates can take turns in taking out the trash or
washing the dishes or preparing dinner. Workmates can plan a
mini-basketball league with other departments, even without the sanction
of HR, and I&amp;rsquo;ve personally witnessed it happen! All these things can be
done, &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; being done, and they will continue to happen without the
formality of a &amp;ldquo;structure&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These examples are just as important, if not more dare I say, as the
loud and massive demonstrations that many leftist groups deploy. It&amp;rsquo;s
because we cannot ignore the daily life; we are in it. Even if many of
us shun politics, as Karel Galang observes, it is important to
destigmatize participation in politics. Even if we don&amp;rsquo;t know it, daily
life is replete with politics; we are in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall lighter mood today than yesterday, despite an impromptu heavy
rain causing a mini-flood &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; the house, despite the noisy
motorcade by a local good-for-nothing fraternity-gang, despite the late
dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, lighter&amp;hellip;is what would get a campfire started in this city.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started a new project, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/alpod&#34;&gt;iPod with Alpine Linux&lt;/a&gt;, an attempt to
sync music between iPod and an Alpine Linux machine, if possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added entry to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/edp/#day-3&#34;&gt;EDP&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/foss&#34;&gt;FOSS&lt;/a&gt; to add a music player.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hideous towns&lt;/em&gt; is a song that I really like from The Sundays. It
captures the alarming feeling of current state of affairs, while still
feeling overtly jolly, because isn&amp;rsquo;t that a proper way to cope with
life&amp;rsquo;s lemons?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My gaze from within the old house stretches to the street level, into
the neighborhood that seems tight-knit but quite literally feels and
smells foul. I hate to think that the only saving grace are the trees,
ever so majestic and wise. The foulness, however, has crept in, the
hatred of which is focused on chopping down our tree friends in the name
of &amp;ldquo;safety&amp;rdquo; and/or &amp;ldquo;progress&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I sign off for the night, the air feels more like
&lt;em&gt;The Pecan Tree&lt;/em&gt; by Deafhaven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Added an entry to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/edp/#day-2&#34;&gt;EDP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;media-center&#34;&gt;Media Center&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of drying my eyes staring on a screen, I kickstarted a project:
repurpose an old laptop into a media center.
Said laptop is a dust-collecting Thinkpad T440 with a dock.
It&amp;rsquo;s a relatively simple project, nothing to write here about.
But here&amp;rsquo;s the roadmap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input checked=&#34;&#34; disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; Update soft- and firmware&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; Replace keyboard (~90% are no longer working)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; Buy HDMI cable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; Legally obtain media&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ipod-classic&#34;&gt;iPod Classic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listen to muzak on my commute home, but it&amp;rsquo;s getting harder to do that
because of the faulty headphone jack of my phone. For some reason, the
jack keeps slipping out of place. It gets annoying when muzak
stutters like that. What&amp;rsquo;s more annoying is that my temporary solution
is to keep a hand in my pocket with the phone, collecting beads of sweat
as one finger pushes down on
the jack so that it stays there, as it should!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This can&amp;rsquo;t be it&lt;/em&gt;, I say to myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought of buying and repurposing a second-hand iPod Classic online,
but I resorted to borrowing &lt;a href=&#34;https://seekers.araw.xyz/repair-ipod/&#34;&gt;the one&lt;/a&gt; my partner already has the she is
not currently using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not without its own issues that it has picked up, I think, from
months of neglect. For one, the battery seems to drain quicker than
expected. I will have to look into this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does one have to do to be good at something?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people said it&amp;rsquo;s consistency, and I tend to agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EDP&lt;/em&gt;, then, is my attempt to slightly improve my writing chops. At the
very least, it&amp;rsquo;s another creative outlet for which I must show up for
a month, at least that&amp;rsquo;s what I tell myself.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I claim that I have more important things going on in my personal life
that I cannot fully attend to because there is work flailing for
attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loads are relative. Complaints bubble up, fester, and disappear all at
once to mix in with the air so gassy my mentholated inhaled could barely
help. In the end, we all become compliant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have decided to take a short (?) break from work&amp;mdash;how short,
who knows&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;mdash;and attempt to focus on those that, per Kondo, &amp;ldquo;spark
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/joyful-militancy&#34;&gt;joy&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the month of Sep 2024, these are the albums I listened to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Album Name&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Artist&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;omw&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Knowmadic&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;My Chemical Romance&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&amp;hellip; Nothing Like The Sun&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Sting&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Tranquility Base Hotel &amp;amp; Casino&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Arctic Monkeys&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just earlier this evening, I listened to &lt;em&gt;Tranquility Base&lt;/em&gt; to accompany
me for a long walk home. And I missed that: not really feeling alone
and having the spirit of the city not messing with you, just being
there, noisy outside the comfort of muzak bubble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might actually depend on the economy.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Exiting September. No need to humor me with &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; song title. I am wide
awake, and yet day by day, I cannot escape the feeling of exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entering October, or as per corpo speak, Q4 2024. Why does it feel like
summer? Is it something connected to the Philippines recently topping
the list of countries that are
&lt;a href=&#34;https://globalnation.inquirer.net/248995/ph-still-worlds-most-at-risk-to-disasters&#34;&gt;most at-risk&lt;/a&gt;
to extreme natural events and negative climate change?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where is the best place to move to outside of Metro Manila, if even such
a place exist? Somewhere not as busy as Cubao, although why am I still
shocked at the number of people in that place on weekends? I can smile
through the bustle of the bourgeoisie, but do tell me, w̰͐h̬̀er͎̫̋̉e̼ͮ
i͐s ͇ͮth̺͔͂̒e̟ͪ ̲̥̲̏ͯ͛f̼u͕̝ć̦k͚͈̞ing̦̯̲ ̳͐soi̅ͦl with thick patches of grass? I wonder if crowd
density would be more acceptable if it were proportional to the number
of trees present in the area. Yes, that would be nice: an urban area
designed as a function of the flora density in it. If the design allows
for no botany in it now or in the future, then it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be
constructed in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the question in the previous paragraph: A common answer might be
some place colder. No offense to the City of Baguio&amp;mdash;but more importantly, out of
respect for its people&amp;mdash;I won&amp;rsquo;t be visiting it in the near future, so
long as it is dealing with it&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href=&#34;https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/09/28/a-stinking-problem-population-tourist-growth-overwhelm-baguios-sewage-system/&#34;&gt;stinking problem&lt;/a&gt;
on population, growth, and sewage system conundrums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll pin this for later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A colleague from Europe told me about the current gloomy weather there
and how they &amp;ldquo;could use some warmth.&amp;rdquo; I scoffed inward and thought,
&amp;ldquo;Maybe we could swap weather for an hour.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find no warmth in my recent sighs, only a glowing rage so magnificent
it might as well transmute the sand in my morning eyes to glass, yet so
tame that I can contain it as cool abstract concepts. Always burning yet
chronically chill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;brief-review-of-alipato-at-muog-2024&#34;&gt;Brief review of &lt;em&gt;Alipato at Muog&lt;/em&gt; (2024)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://alipatoatmuog.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alipato at Muog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Flying Embers and a
Fortress) is a documentary about the director JL Burgos&amp;rsquo;s brother,
Jonas, and how Jonas has been missing since 2007 when he was forcibly
disappeared by, as the film shows, the military. An enforced
disappearance is considered to be &amp;ldquo;the arrest, detention, abduction or
any other form of deprivation of liberty by agents of State.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the grim story that surrounds and affects the victims and their
families and friends, the viewers are tagged along in imagined
non-gratuitous imageries and scenarios, artfully animated through chalk
drawings, supplementing the footages that the director himself had
taken. During the question-and-answer portion after the screening,
Burgos told the audience that it was hard not to get mad while filming
the videos; but remaining calm was tantamount in recording the actual
behavior of the subjects in that moment. I agree: after seeing the State
agents&amp;rsquo; behavior, it&amp;rsquo;s impossible not to be incensed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;flame-of-courage&#34;&gt;Flame of courage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently found out that there&amp;rsquo;s a monument dedicated to the almost
2,000 desaparecidos at
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baclaran_Church&#34;&gt;Baclaran Church&lt;/a&gt;
(which by the way
has this almost-brutalist architecture that I love).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/image/desap01.jpg&#34;
    alt=&#34;A monument depicting a mother and a child, both of them standing atop a pedestal, both of them are mostly white. The mother is raising a torch, with the flame colored red. The child, a boy, is holding a tote bag on his right hand, and on his left, he is holding a picture of a man close to his chest.&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;FLAME OF COURAGE&lt;/em&gt;, July 13, 1994&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never forgetting
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_law_under_Ferdinand_Marcos&#34;&gt;Marcos Sr.&amp;rsquo;s signing of Proclamation No. 1081&lt;/a&gt;
beginning his dictatorship on 21 Sep 1972; never forgiving the
wrong-doers until they are held accountable for the pain and suffering
they have caused and &lt;em&gt;continue&lt;/em&gt; to cause; and, in solidarity with the
desaparecidos and their families and friends, some of whom I personally
know and am close to, we demand truth and justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/image/desap03.jpg&#34;
    alt=&#34;Red roses and lit candles are placed near the monument to honor the victims of enforced disappearance.&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excerpt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are the families of James Jazmines and Felix Salaveria Jr, both of
whom are family men, community and environmental activists, cycling
friends and who have both become victims of enforced disappearances -
James on 23 August and Felix on 28 August in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have started this campaign to demand that the Philippines authorities
investigate their abductions, return them both safely to us, and bring
those responsible for their disappearances to justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please support our campaign to surface James and Felix and all other
victims of enforced disappearances in the Philippines by signing this
petition. We are targeting 1,000.00 signatures in 5 days. The petition
will be presented to the president of the Philippines Ferdinand Marcos,
Jr. DILG Secretary Benhur Abalos, PNP Chief and AFP Chief.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I urge any readers of this blog to please read and sign the petition!
Kindly also share among your friends and families, especially to
Filipino communities. We would appreciate your support.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pagers</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href=&#34;https://mastodon.world/@Mer__edith&#34;&gt;Meredith Whittaker&lt;/a&gt;, President
of &lt;a href=&#34;https://signal.org/&#34;&gt;Signal Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, was interviewed by
Andy Greenberg for Wired in the article
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wired.com/story/meredith-whittaker-signal/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Signal Is More Than Encrypted Messaging. Under Meredith Whittaker, It’s Out to Prove Surveillance Capitalism Wrong&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;, she said how she would need to reach one of her engineers &amp;ldquo;with a pager&amp;rdquo; in case Signal&amp;rsquo;s servers go down.
The passing mention of &lt;strong&gt;pager&lt;/strong&gt; sparked a renewed interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have never had one, a pager, but I remember the awe feeling when I
first saw it, when a cousin coolly unholstered it from his hip to check
the notification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pagers were mostly phased out by the
time I got my first mobile phone. In terms of practicality, mobile
phones are objectively more useful. Of course, pagers are still in use
today, particularly in the medical field. Outside that, some fast food
chains and coffee shops also use them to &amp;ldquo;call&amp;rdquo; the customer when
their order is ready to be picked up from the counter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the recent terror attack of Israel against Lebanon using
exploding pagers&amp;mdash;and later, walkie-talkies, which I&amp;rsquo;m also interested
in!&amp;mdash;made me re-evaluate this rabbit hole of mine &lt;em&gt;big time&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The articles below are provided for posterity, but the reader is invited
to do their own research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reuters: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/pagers-drones-how-hezbollah-aims-counter-israels-high-tech-surveillance-2024-07-09/&#34;&gt;How Hezbollah used pagers and couriers to counter Israel&amp;rsquo;s high tech surveillance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The New York Times: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/18/world/israel-hezbollah-gaza-hamas&#34;&gt;More Wireless Devices Explode in Lebanon in Second Attack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AP: &lt;a href=&#34;https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-exploding-pagers-hezbollah-syria-ce6af3c2e6de0a0dddfae48634278288&#34;&gt;Lebanon is rocked again by exploding devices as Israel declares a new phase of war&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AP: &lt;a href=&#34;https://apnews.com/live/lebanon-syria-pagers-hezbollah-updates&#34;&gt;Walkie-talkie explosions injure hundreds in Lebanon a day after pager attacks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t/can&amp;rsquo;t offer any political analysis in this post; the reader will
have to make it on their own. But, someone on the internet wonders in
jest maybe, could this possibly explain the spontaneous combustion
stories from the early 2000s?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Am I real?</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/214/</link>

&lt;li&gt;Edited CSS to add better text highlighting when making &lt;code&gt;::selection&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Light edit on &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/site&#34;&gt;Site&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, I ask the question both in jest and earnest, as if to address
the two wolves living in me. I look around,
and the world around me continues to be a messy place. Am I raided by
wolves? So many things to
do with so limited time, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/55&#34;&gt;I have always wondered&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/121&#34;&gt;if any of these are real&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; it&amp;rsquo;s Real: how can it not when my senses tell me so, when the
loves I give and receive empowers me to believe so?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-earnest-internet-sleuthing&#34;&gt;In earnest: Internet sleuthing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since I came across detective stories through Sherlock Holmes, C.
Auguste Dupin, and Dr. Haledjian, I dreamed of being one someday. It
felt good solving cases and catching the bad guys. As I
grow older and a little bit wiser, I realize that reality is never that
simple. At least in fiction, I reach a closure. In real life, that
rarely happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be detective is to be a private investigator, at least based on my
limited understanding on what a traditional detective is. I don&amp;rsquo;t want
that. PIs tend to become pawns of police and the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet sleuthing is probably the next best thing. We have so many
tools available via &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/osint&#34;&gt;open source intelligence&lt;/a&gt; (OSINT) that we can use
to really help, like
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/how-tos/2024/08/30/marine-oil-spill-detection-guide/&#34;&gt;detecting marine oil spill&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/how-tos/2024/07/31/a-beginners-guide-to-identifying-explosive-ordnance-in-social-media-imagery/&#34;&gt;identifying explosive ordnance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the actions I do in the meatspace, OSINT is another arsenal I
am going to be adding to my list. This is one of the ways I try to make
sense of the turbulence we face at multiple fronts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-jest-weirdness&#34;&gt;In jest: Weirdness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have listed weirdness one of my core
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/personal-principles&#34;&gt;personal principles&lt;/a&gt; (at least as of writing this).
I remember coming up with a random phrase&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;soil shampoo&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash; back when
I was younger, and
&lt;em&gt;owning&lt;/em&gt; it as if it were an accessory to show off. I would somehow
weave the phrase into blogs, status messages, etc. &amp;ldquo;Soil shampoo&amp;rdquo; means
nothing to most people, even to me now, just like most of art, dare I say.
But just like weird art, it was good for my soul&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have mannerisms that some people might find odd (don&amp;rsquo;t we all have
that?). Sometimes, people would ask me if I&amp;rsquo;m okay, to which, my
response most of the time is a casual smile and a slight nod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just think that this society is rarely kind to introverts. Accepting,
maybe, tolerant. But when people around me cannot put into words the
silence, they need to do something with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No wonder more and more people are turning silly, seeking validation
from parasocial &amp;ldquo;content&amp;rdquo; (or vlogs) in YouTube and in other video
streaming sites.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking of doing more non-profit stuff just to feel
something new and exciting. Have you ever done that? If so, good for
you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just go out there&amp;mdash;or be in here, that works, too&amp;mdash;and help
however way I can to people in wherever midpoints they would like to
meet me; to support the causes they believe in, &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt;
have a stake in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That might be my sabbatical leave, if I even reach that point of no
longer just wondering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue, now that I have had a minute to pause and reflect and
overthink, is finding the courage. The mighty forces at work are good at
many things, one of which is giving us the illusion of comfort while
taking away some, if not many, of our freedoms: freedom to chill; to
just create (and maybe bl&lt;em&gt;ah&lt;/em&gt;g about random things) and not worry about
getting by; to go out and wander into the unknown and unknowable to, of
course, make friends. To just be. And so I seek always for that courage
in the data I find in rabbit holes, in wisdom from friends who have
experienced more of the world than I am. But I am still here.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Paradox of comfy mazes</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/212/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 02 Sep 2024 04:09:42 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/212/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I think of entering entrepreneurship in some form that I
could sustain, and gamble what little savings I have in the hopes of
making a decent money in a shorter period of time. In this scenario, the
goal is to exit the rat maze. This hypothetical thinking is not new to
me; and when it resurfaces, I find myself stocking up on ideas and how
to monetize them. I look for other people&amp;rsquo;s insight on the matter; I
&amp;ldquo;pick their brain&amp;rdquo; from a safe distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned the word &amp;ldquo;gamble&amp;rdquo; earlier, because one would need more luck
to have a relatively successful business and sustain it for as long as
possible. When all of this is done
and the excitement has died down, I am left again with the nasty feeling
that this would be MORE WORK, which &lt;em&gt;gamble&lt;/em&gt; actually comprises&amp;mdash;you know, the very rat maze I&amp;rsquo;m claiming
to escape from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, I have always been risk averse, but not for the most common
reasons. I understand the need to break from status quo and to keep on
pushing the limits of comfort zone. Is there, then, a path that leads
away from the rat maze and is still sustainable for everyone, myself
especially?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;More on that, after this message from BetterHelp.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the month of Aug 2024, these are the albums I listened to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Album Name&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Artist&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;open this wall&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;berlioz&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;City Summer&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Dyalla&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;August is an interesting month indeed, and so many things are occupying
my headspace that I rarely have the time to explore new muzak. These two
new albums, though, are okay and still enjoyable in their own rights,
mostly because they do not &amp;ldquo;get in the way&amp;rdquo; and just let you be.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;More rants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;global-norths-cheat-code&#34;&gt;Global north&amp;rsquo;s cheat code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Businesses in global north have been outsourcing a chunk of the &amp;ldquo;boring
work&amp;rdquo; in their processes to Latin America, India, Philippines, and other
English-speaking countries in the global south. Apparently, this is a
&amp;ldquo;cheat code&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and the use is obvious: to gain maximum
productivity for the cheapest cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USD 5/hr is not bad by local rates, yes, but it also means that these
employers do not think our time is worth the same as theirs. Following
the profit incentive, this tactic makes sense; otherwise, BPO industries
would not have flourished. Framed differently though, if
you want to enjoy life, you should be more desparate. That is why I am not
for the profit incentive of the already privileged, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;adventure-time&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adventure Time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix &lt;em&gt;nihil&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;I recently restarted watching &lt;em&gt;Adventure Time&lt;/em&gt; when I
have the capacity to do so. It is all harmless &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/absurdism&#34;&gt;absurd fun&lt;/a&gt;
that may or may not contain gems that only adults would detect,
depending on how they deep they would read into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I pause and reflect if a scene is meant to say something
deep. When I unpause, I realize that in the end, it does not really
matter, as long as all the drawings and the colors are fun and cute, and
the dialogue chill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If by &amp;ldquo;cheat&amp;rdquo; you mean being thoroughly unfair to desparate
people, then I would accept the term.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I like it when people say something about their &amp;ldquo;leaning into anarchy&amp;rdquo;
when talking about the end of the world as we know it, because of
several things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I honestly hope they would lean into it. Imagine unleashing all the
joy, tapping all the potential trapped within, empowering other people
they care about. To do that, though, they must first realize what
anarchy truly means; but&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Anarchy&amp;rdquo; may sound more sophisticated than &amp;ldquo;chaos&amp;rdquo; but it is
the latter to which they are actually committing (anarchy is not
necessarily chaos); and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s like being on an inside joke with them where only I know what&amp;rsquo;s
funny about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>The cycle of recording walks</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/209/</link>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/blogroll&#34;&gt;blogroll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned from not tracking my steps to tracking them, back to not
tracking them again. This is a quick rant/rave on how a seemingly good
idea can be detrimental to one&amp;rsquo;s mental health as experienced by yours
truly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data analytics might help you learn more things about yourself, which
allows you to plan your next course of action to improve your well-being
and/or those around you. Tracking important metrics do help if and when
used properly. The people following and practicing the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://quantifiedself.com/get-started/&#34;&gt;Quantified Self&lt;/a&gt;
call this &amp;ldquo;everyday science.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been recording a few data points about myself like habits and
meals, which I physically jot on my &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/bujo&#34;&gt;analog notebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This way,
I bind myself to visit my notebook daily, even if there&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;nothing
else&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
to write except these data points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily use them in any meaningful way&amp;mdash;at least I
haven&amp;rsquo;t found a use case&amp;mdash;nor do I stare at them with maximum intent
expecting to extract an insight about my being. Our ancestors, I think,
did okay not obsessing over the many details about themselves, so why
should I?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt;, not for myself but for others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;promise-of-charity&#34;&gt;Promise of charity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started when my current employer made a promise. And, of course, we
know what happens to the promises made by top management. Anyway, &lt;em&gt;Walk
for a Cause&lt;/em&gt; should be about one of our ways to give back to community.
For every kilometer an employee walks, the employer would donate XX
amount in Philippine pesos to a chosen charity, provided there is proof.
The proof, we surmised, would be in the form of a screenshot of a
fitness app of your choosing that recorded your walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, it would have been a small scale charity, which is something
I&amp;rsquo;m not fond of. Charity assumes that the recipient is incapable,
lacking autonomy, or does not have anything to offer back; and it relies
on &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/empire&#34;&gt;inequalities of wealth and power&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;d rather
participate in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/mutual-aid&#34;&gt;mutual aid&lt;/a&gt;, though I know that within the
context, it&amp;rsquo;s not going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XX&lt;/strong&gt;, by the way, is the equivalent to the current amount of a
ultra-cheap candy in your local store. Whatever amount you have in your
head, XX is probably lower than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, for two seconds, my workmates and I had buzzed at the prospect of
getting fit&lt;em&gt;ter&lt;/em&gt; and possibly helping others. We set up our fitness
apps, began recording our walks, and even walked to and from work when
normally, we would be in some mode of wheeled transportation. People
would share their progress, because we wanted to inspire one another. We
were dedicated to this thing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for me, I used &lt;a href=&#34;https://codeberg.org/jannis/FitoTrack&#34;&gt;FitoTrack&lt;/a&gt; to
record my walks. Sometimes, I would forget to hit record, and that would
be enough for me to lose it a little. Eventually, I did it enough number
of times that it became a sort of religious experience. When you attach
data gathering (collecting number of kilometers) to a relatively mundane
experience (walking) and make it an important metric (basis for donation
of XX amount), people, myself included, will come up with all sorts of
things to make it in their heads a spiritual practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hadn&amp;rsquo;t needed walking to be a spiritual practice for me to do it; I
already like walking. The ancients had it right; walking clears the
mind. And who wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet I participated in this promise. Because, one thing I haven&amp;rsquo;t
mentioned yet, which was also a major driver for us to join this,
is the social aspect of it. Naturally, my monkey
brain likes socializing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking alone works for certain people. It certainly did help
philosophers enough to write about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking with friends is nice and lively, as I have experienced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, imagine walking with your community! For a cause at that! Isn&amp;rsquo;t this
why, for some, Strava has become a dating app?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;back-to-where-we-started&#34;&gt;Back to where we started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human resources, being the classic HR, deemed that this might be getting
out of [their] hand and decided to shut it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that was that. People no longer shared their progress. They stopped
&amp;ldquo;walking for a cause.&amp;rdquo; Safety is now the priority. Sure&amp;mdash;by remaining
&amp;ldquo;safe&amp;rdquo; we have averted a dip in the bottomline, have we not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to think that some of us have developed a habit out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stopped tracking my walks. In a sense, I am grateful, because I am
liberated from the duty of having to fumble through my phone and
record my walk. One less thing to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an increasingly &lt;em&gt;needlessly&lt;/em&gt; high-tech society, choosing
lower tech options is a form of resistance, something I try to do in
every aspect of my life.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely, there&amp;rsquo;s always something to write about. And writing
in itself is a habit that I somewhat track, the record of which is
itself, not data on a separate log.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>EXPECT RESISTANCE</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/208/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 20 Aug 2024 02:59:55 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/208/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finished and added a book to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/books&#34;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;brief-review-of-expect-resistance&#34;&gt;Brief review of &lt;em&gt;Expect Resistance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&#34;https://crimethinc.com/books/expect-resistance&#34;&gt;field manual&lt;/a&gt; by
CrimethInc is &amp;ldquo;not one, but three books, each of which may be read as a
complete work unto itself.&amp;rdquo; It reminds me of how prefiguring the many
possible realities as imagined &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; lived by revolutionaries is still
much preferred despite the many flaws of humans. These flaws colliding
can certainly create conflict, and indeed it is as natural as it is
inevitable. Why, then, must we create unfair and unjust laws and
legalize henchmen to enforce them so that we can all &amp;ldquo;co-exist&amp;rdquo;. If we
can both thrive separately and still empower each other at the same
time, isn&amp;rsquo;t that the more enticing path for all of us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;more-reflection&#34;&gt;More reflection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whenever I&amp;rsquo;m at odds with the forces that make this society function,
I have to keep myself in check. What would be the effect of my
resisting now alone? I don&amp;rsquo;t know, likely none. It might be better to
secure a safety net first before acting more radically.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We as a society have pressure valves in place in the form of
[adventure] tourism and recreation drugs. But I want to get a glimpse
of a life beyond this. I&amp;rsquo;m getting tired of having commodified
entertainment to keep my sanity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not everyone who wants to change their lives has the capacity to read
deeply into &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/politics&#34;&gt;theories&lt;/a&gt;. This does not mean that their
thoughts and feelings are anything less than
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/academy&#34;&gt;those who &amp;ldquo;know&amp;rdquo; their theory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If &amp;ldquo;stealing is immoral,&amp;rdquo; then we are right to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/capitalism&#34;&gt;condemn capitalists&lt;/a&gt; for
stealing from the working class. And we are right to condemn all
states for stealing our freedoms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who decides which are my desires? The truth is, a huge fraction of it
comes from the nature, nurture, and culture of those around me. Many
times, I am just a recipient. Sometimes, a glitch happens, and I form
and want my own desires. But it is fleeting. And it is always testing
me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s nothing wrong with wanting to be the main character of your
own epic if it means taking matters to your own hands, AND NOT doing
things you like at the expense of others&amp;rsquo; freedoms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I say I want to escape the norm, I mean to exit the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/empire&#34;&gt;social cancer&lt;/a&gt; that destroys everything by transforming diversity with sameness. Usually, I fail&amp;mdash;the cancer has gone deep. The cure, I think, is &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/chaos&#34;&gt;to nurture the anomalous&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The psychiatrists, dentists, doctors, and the lucky healthcare workers
who have found great pay in reducing harm, what are they thinking?
What have they been up to? When their supposed success depends on the
misery of others, one shall not be faulted to think that they are
vultures circling around the bodies and minds of those [on the verge
of] breaking down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can aim for a more &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/transformative-justice&#34;&gt;transformative justice&lt;/a&gt; for people who refuse to respect
others&amp;rsquo; needs. But in a world, ruled by force, this will always be met
with some form of &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/violence&#34;&gt;violence&lt;/a&gt;. As we defend ourselves,
let&amp;rsquo;s be careful not to lose our sights.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tourism destroys the observed in many ways, as it creates a border to
alienate observers. Tourist spots become profit hubs for
entrepreneurs, draining the local beauty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Media extracts its content from everyday life and weeds out the ugly
parts before serving it back to us. We &amp;ldquo;relate&amp;rdquo; to it, and integrate
its material into our daily speech and mannerisms, and becomes pop
culture. We homogenize our culture through modernity, and I am
thinking my place in it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Privileged access to truth is called objectivity, and those who cannot
and/or will not access it is shunned and ostracized by those that do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To get rid of oppressors like &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/fascism&#34;&gt;fascists&lt;/a&gt;, sexists, statists, etc., in
our midst, we must obsolete their beliefs &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/prefiguration&#34;&gt;by continuously demonstrating&lt;/a&gt;
that cooperation and &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/mutual-aid&#34;&gt;mutual aid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/community/#living-together-with-differences&#34;&gt;despite differences&lt;/a&gt;, will be better
for us all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We see homelessness and destitution as the end result of not
successfully participating in the Empire. So, we choose
wage-slavery and work to get by. &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/anti-work&#34;&gt;What would happen if we all negate both&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If many of us believe that we are not capable of governing our own
bodies and working with the community around us, it is because of
generations of systematic and systemic abuse from states which have
disabled us. Learning and believing otherwise would mean undoing all
of this violence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HISTORY, if we mean the documented narrative written by those
privileged enough, cannot and will not encompass the entire Human
Experience. Sure, we can opt to learn from it, if only to study what
the bloody victors have included in the manuscript. But we can also
learn from the &amp;ldquo;unvetted&amp;rdquo; sources&amp;mdash;of the mundane, of oral tradition
and folklore, of the dear-diary&amp;rsquo;s that gather dust. Thankfully, many
of them have survived&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I AM A DREAMER who have stumbled upon, by luck, possible worlds from
which our lives can both coexist and branch into. Worlds that seem to
be just beyond the edge of this current tumultuous one, in which chaos
is considered a bad thing, and not the natural thing that could
sustain us if we only found the guts to wield it. I wonder how the
splintering of realities to infinite outcomes must look from the void.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Cycling thoughts</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/207/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 16 Aug 2024 01:42:48 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/207/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mornings are always a good time to ride a bike wherever or whenever the
destination is. As for the latter, I speak it un-mystically in that, my
days often pass without having observed them enough to remember the
details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t suppose cycling would help, but perhaps it might in
small ways. Missing the details would mean gaps in memory. Now, what
liquid gold is there with which to fill these cracks? Is it in
fictionalizing what was forgotten? Artists call it creative journalism,
an excuse to express the void because reality&amp;mdash;boredom&amp;mdash;does not
always work. And I want to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori&#34;&gt;write a book&lt;/a&gt;, but can we leave
out the part where I have to disclose how I tend to not remember
everything?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The urban smog might shroud our skies and honking of
cars might make everyone more annoyed than what is needed, but this
exercise is part of the experience: You, the rider, is a weaver of
invisible paths, lining the gaps of cars and pedestrians alike with your
dust &lt;em&gt;safely&lt;/em&gt;, because you are in it not for the thrill but for the fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life, I am realizing, is more interesting when it passes by while
&amp;ldquo;you&amp;rsquo;re on a bike&amp;rdquo; as compared to being &amp;ldquo;in a car&amp;rdquo;. Biking to and from
places is both tiring and reinvigorating. It&amp;rsquo;s a laugh at angry drivers
stuck in gridlock.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Thinking about making zines doesn&#39;t produce zines</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/206/</link>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/foss&#34;&gt;FOSS&lt;/a&gt; list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent visit to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/xeroxography/&#34;&gt;BLTX Aug 2024&lt;/a&gt; (Instagram link) has
reshuffled my life&amp;rsquo;s priorities, one of the effects being eyeing
at online listings for
second-hand typewriters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s okay,&amp;rdquo; I kid myself. We don&amp;rsquo;t have much time left anyways,
and for all we know, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/collapse&#34;&gt;we&amp;rsquo;re already spinning out of control&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dare not daydream further. Analysis paralysis has stonegazed me while
the remaining Reason continuously Heimlich-maneuvers me so I don&amp;rsquo;t lose
being Here Now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the near future, I can see myself making zines, both to pass time and
to self-administer a pseudo-therapy for myself wanting to do something
with these two hands other than pressing keys on a keyboard for some 40 hours in
a work week.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Time to wake up, graduates!</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/205/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 31 Jul 2024 02:44:02 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/205/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slight edit on Index.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;me&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;a byproduct of Tumblr nightposts &amp;amp; neodadaism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: What
are words if not for making out with the minds of future generations who
have yet to spring from the nurturing Void?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;recently-on-graduation&#34;&gt;Recently, on graduation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I had the chance to attend a graduation ceremony of a loved
one. Per tradition, organizers invited alumni speakers
with PhDs supposedly to deliver inspirational messages to the
graduates. Who were they kidding, though? These speakers could rarely
give engaging speeches, especially when all they have in their notes are
lists of their achievements that, frankly, only few of the audience
cares about, if any at all. One of the speakers even had to admit&amp;mdash;on stage,
addressing the bored people in front of him, as if finally snapping out
of his trance of pompousness&amp;mdash;that (non-verbatim) &amp;ldquo;[s]ince many of you are
starting to fall asleep, I&amp;rsquo;ll cut to my message.&amp;rdquo; &lt;em&gt;Wow&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your words cannot make out with the minds of future generations,
don&amp;rsquo;t even bother stepping on the stage. Go publish a paper, instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a hypothetical scenario in which I&amp;rsquo;m also a guest speaker right after
the PhD guy, my impromptu ice-breaker would be: &amp;ldquo;[&lt;em&gt;yawns into the mic&lt;/em&gt;]
Thanks for that boring speech, Dr. _____. Time to wake up, graduates!&amp;rdquo;
And then proceed to also flop on my speech! Haha!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lightning-rally&#34;&gt;Lightning rally&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leftist activists from that university, as usual, had a lightning rally
at the end, which in my opinion, was just bad performance for many reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t disruptive like how demonstrations should be, because it&amp;rsquo;s
expected that these leftists will do this;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The big-name people including the university chancellor for whom many
of their talking points are had already left at this point;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not like people were asking to be disrupted by these activists&#39;
shrilling into the microphone and megaphones. Almost five hours in,
people were already tired and hungry, and the last thing they wanted
to hear were social injustices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could have been worth remembering if they talked, NOT yelled,
&lt;em&gt;briefly&lt;/em&gt; about how creating spaces where &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/friendship&#34;&gt;friendship&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/community&#34;&gt;community&lt;/a&gt; is just as important as
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/health/#self-care&#34;&gt;self-care&lt;/a&gt;, that rest is resistance,
and that all of these can and will
contribute to the long-game small-r &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/revolution&#34;&gt;revolution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the month of Jul 2024, these are the albums I listened to.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2010s EDM as worship songs</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/204/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 28 Jul 2024 02:48:45 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/204/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; as in, worship the good times it brings back from memories. We all
could use some happy thoughts, and if raving (sans unlisted drugs) could
help, I&amp;rsquo;m all for it. I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are songs today that could evoke
the same feeling, but no one is pulling me to the orbit where I can get
those fresh new muzak&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, conjuring happy thoughts could never have dispelled the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1965762/21-dead-after-typhoon-carina-pounds-ph-pnp&#34;&gt;panic and trauma brought about by Typhoon Carina&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/image/yakal.jpg&#34;
    alt=&#34;A glass facade of a building reflecting the facade of another building across the road&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;How could a boring glass have class? Through &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/188&#34;&gt;amateur photography&lt;/a&gt;, maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lines like these on the building were still in tact when we reached
the innards of that city for a long overdue appointment. This was after
eating cold soba, which wasn&amp;rsquo;t so bad, filling and tasty in its own way.
This was even after the super strong coffee that we had, supposedly as a
reward for not getting caffeine into our bodies. This is even after
getting the matching tattoos in solidarity with the people of Palestine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lines, no matter the brute, once again I found in the underrated
streets of Makati. The city has become only familiar now through the
shape of its skyline and ways. The details can be stretched and plied
again, where it truly matters, but they have
long since been foreign to my senses.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mb.com.ph/2024/2/8/lra-transfers-embo-barangay-property-transactions-to-taguig&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s even shedding its EMBO places to Taguig&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My last main anchor in that city was Lola Mila. Now that
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/173/#farewell-lola-mila&#34;&gt;she&amp;rsquo;s gone&lt;/a&gt;,
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if there&amp;rsquo;s any good reason
left to travel through the horrible traffic to get to that city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I can&amp;rsquo;t leave this post on a dark note. So here&amp;rsquo;s a quick
transition to something that&amp;rsquo;s bothering me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The persistence of mosquitoes leaves itchy points on my body, phantom
dots more like. When I swat my skin, I see no speck of blood, no dead
bug. Sometimes, I sway my limb to shoo them away; sometimes it works.
The illusion of proboscis pricking my skin is imprinted on me, no thanks
to the mind games of these bloodsuckers. Complacency on my end&amp;mdash;where
has it ever gotten me? Whether it be via sleep or just ignorance, they
will have gotten their fix before I even realize what is happening. Like
most miracles of nature, they go unnoticed. Mostly, that is, until my
palms land squarely on them.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many years has it been since I was last inside this old odd
building? The aesthetics and external branding might have been refreshed
over the years, but the overall form remains the same. It&amp;rsquo;s evident in
the funky smell of the restrooms, which, by the way, one must pay for to
enter and use.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Phone booth spotted&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with other friends and family, I showed up in the
opening exhibit of artworks of Gab Ferrer et al. The event had a
relatively big sound system set up, featured a busy DJ as he constantly
switched records to play good and loud muzak from Japanese artists. I
didn&amp;rsquo;t stick long enough to hear whether he played City Pop songs that I
know and love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The room I am in bursts into flames. Can&amp;rsquo;t say my sweat saves my sanity.
Lucky me finds the latch of the fire exit in time to escape the
hell&amp;hellip;into the sea, roaring waves waiting as I now free-fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My pyrotechnic home above and behind me, while the waters in front and
below me, the latter fast approaching. The blueness alerts me of my
capacity to swim: nil.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Greener Pastures</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Only we can define and set our standards of what &amp;ldquo;greener pastures&amp;rdquo;
would look like for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if I want something beyond what the greener pastures offer,
even though by all current metrics, they offer me a better situation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we&amp;rsquo;re destined to be more than just domesticated
livestock&amp;mdash;and maybe even liberate [some of] them&amp;mdash;for the overlords
to milk dry and strip to the core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rarely regret ditching opportunities for greener pasture, because
oftentimes I realize that the cycles of dread and drudgery will persist
no matter how the fields are presented and advertised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to distinguish greener pastures from a rat maze, unless viewed
from above.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I refuse to be stuck in loops of [internally?] screaming life away,
but it can be hard to escape the pull, to snatch myself back into
present. Heavier things, I&amp;rsquo;m told, are harder to steal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mind: empty. Thoughts: 0. At this fleeting moment of non-philosophical
musing, if you split my head open, there&amp;rsquo;s only the risk of rage
animating the self to open-fire inbound by way of old-fashioned fists
and fangs, the greatest hits delivered between the ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I show up along with other people, even if I do nothing else
except be present in the[ir] moment. In solidarity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pool</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/199/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 29 Jun 2024 04:31:01 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/199/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s happy hour again every hour, because somewhere, as they say, it&amp;rsquo;s
time to relax and drink one&amp;rsquo;s favorite beverage. They call this &lt;em&gt;happy
hour&lt;/em&gt; and not, say, &amp;ldquo;team building&amp;rdquo; because, I think, it&amp;rsquo;s meant to
represent festivities beyond constructing and/or mending
relationships among peers, even though the whole ordeal lasts typically
for more than 60 minutes. Plus, it has a low-budget, low-stakes ring to
it, an event that demands no grueling work for anyone who wants to get
involved&amp;mdash;just fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this particular happy hour, based on my limited understanding of the
word, is barely happy. I have talked to people; they dread of &amp;ldquo;going
back to reality&amp;rdquo; as if this trough of peace in the waves of stress isn&amp;rsquo;t
real. I have [not] seen some things; I have [not] felt some feelings.
The consensus: boring.
And, to be honest, that&amp;rsquo;s fine. It&amp;rsquo;s nice to be away from &amp;ldquo;reality&amp;rdquo;
sometimes. Happy or otherwise, it&amp;rsquo;s a needed break.
Although, I would have preferred
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/anti-work&#34;&gt;not to resume work forever&lt;/a&gt;, but that won&amp;rsquo;t be feasible,
will it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least, there&amp;rsquo;s a pool. At night, dead gamugamos fill the shallow end
as they dive into it. At morning, their bodies will have been removed by
an invisible cleaner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pool contains, mostly, water which can be an all-surrounding metaphor
for people like me who cannot find in themselves to be relaxed while
submerged in it. What is mammalian dive reflex? To me, it&amp;rsquo;s an attempt
to stay aware of the thalassophobia that gradually engulfs every fiber
of my being. Water is a powerful chemical: it can give and take life. It
creates and destroys. Didn&amp;rsquo;t we we just had our drainage reconstructed
because of this water&amp;rsquo;s trait? So, when swimming is a skill yet to be
learned, I remain cautious around large bodies of water. Though it&amp;rsquo;s
calmness almost seduces me into coming over, I know what I can and can&amp;rsquo;t
do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The happy ending for now must not be in the deepest end, must it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3m8ElO9Y50Y&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pool&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is also a love song by Paramore&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Godzilla Minus One (2023)</title>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/site&#34;&gt;Site&lt;/a&gt; to replace one of my inspirations for building
this digital garden.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/robots.txt&#34;&gt;robots.txt&lt;/a&gt; which is more of a symbolic act at
this point rather than something I expect to fend off corporations&#39;
web crawlers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently watched &lt;em&gt;Godzilla Minus One&lt;/em&gt;. While this isn&amp;rsquo;t a review per se,
it made me reflect. Watching and then thinking about
war is somewhat downing. I&amp;rsquo;m grateful that no one around me glamorized
and glorified the last world war in telling their stories. Nobody wins
in wars except those who profit from it and those who gain power by
participating in it, which is just handful of people, really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one deserves to be caught in the middle of a war. No one deserves to
be displaced and uprooted, to be killed, to starve in it, especially the
marginalized and the disenfranchised. No one deserves to be forced to
give up their lives to fight someone else&amp;rsquo;s battle and have no full
autonomy in it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Partying hard for a change</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/197/</link>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finished a book and added it to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/books&#34;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;party&#34;&gt;Party!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking of&amp;mdash;sadly, not being in&amp;mdash;parties. Partying hard is
ultimately subjective. To me, partying should be jovial and inclusive,
and is in itself a resistance to opulence and materialism. If you cannot
make your party happen without consuming excessive amounts of resources,
&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; if the unused resources would be wasted away after the event, then
I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be in it. Please don&amp;rsquo;t invite me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-legend-of-korra-change&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Legend of Korra: Change&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just finished watching the whole series, and honestly it leaves a lot to
be desired. But this is not a review of the series as a whole, but
rather a comment on &lt;em&gt;Book 3: Change&lt;/em&gt;, specifically on the character of
Zaheer, the season&amp;rsquo;s protagonist. Spoilers ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zaheer and his merry band of Red Lotus claim that they are anarchists,
in that they are anti-authority and dream of liberation for all. They
are the direct-action, non-consensus, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/violence&#34;&gt;violent&lt;/a&gt; kind, and
they are not my comrades. His revolution could never succeed because he
forced the Earth Kingdom into a state for which the people haven&amp;rsquo;t
really prepared. &amp;ldquo;Removing [the Earth Queen] from office&amp;rdquo; (i.e., killing
her) only created a power vacuum, and power-hungry folks rushed in
to fill the void. Genuine anarchists would have understood that power
vacuums are a thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean Zaheer isn&amp;rsquo;t relatable, &lt;em&gt;ofc&lt;/em&gt; he is! I&amp;rsquo;d be lying if I
say I didn&amp;rsquo;t dream of deposing a tyrant via violent vehicles. But the freedom
he desires for all cannot be achieved in an instant, not even in one
lifetime. In the universe of &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt;, even the Avatars have trouble &amp;ldquo;keeping
balance&amp;rdquo; for thousands of years.
It takes time to build &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/community&#34;&gt;communities&lt;/a&gt; that would no
longer be dependent on &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/empire&#34;&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>126th Philippine Independence Day</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/196/</link>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit Index.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added an item in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/books&#34;&gt;booklist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my annual complaint on how half of the year went by in a wink.
Today is also this country&amp;rsquo;s supposed Independence Day. I dare not ask
its legitimacy with the unfolding of series of bad events; as long as I get to
rest from work, count me in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-character-vibes&#34;&gt;Main Character vibes?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you still feel like the main character of your own story?
Could it be that there are a few people in your life that don&amp;rsquo;t deserve
the emotional labor that you&amp;rsquo;re investing in them? Life is too short to
live alone, so we build &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/community&#34;&gt;communities&lt;/a&gt;, but we don&amp;rsquo;t
relinquish living so that one abusive person can suck out the joy from
all his peers. We don&amp;rsquo;t thrive when we enable (knowingly or otherwise)
any abusive tendencies. This reminds me of someone we know, a typical white
male American migrant, who&amp;rsquo;s now operating in 95% fiction mode, i.e.,
lies. The remaining 5% of his energy, he uses in this reality to meet
his basic needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;zesto-gang&#34;&gt;Zesto Gang&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently heard a modus operandi from many years ago from a group
dubbed Zesto Gang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll let an article about &lt;a href=&#34;https://balitangviral.com/top-10-modus-operandi-of-criminals-in-manila/3/&#34;&gt;The Zesto Gang&lt;/a&gt; how it&amp;rsquo;s done:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gang member would board the bus, usually looking like a bus
conductor (with bills of cash folded lengthwise and wound around the
fingers by denomination just like what a typical bus conductor does).
He’d ask an unsuspecting passenger: “&lt;em&gt;Ilan?&lt;/em&gt; (How many?)”. The
passenger, thinking he’s the legitimate conductor, answers [with] how many
people he or she would pay the fares of and hands over the payment. To
the passenger’s surprise, the gang member gets juice packs from out of
nowhere, swiftly pokes straw in them and hand them to the astounded
passenger. Dare to protest and say “That’s not what I….”, the gang
member simply interrupts and say: “Ah, it’s too late, I already
punched the straw in.” And guess what, they jack up the price of the
juice pack to as much as ten times the actual price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought it&amp;rsquo;s a witty and funny scam, but I surely would not want to
go though that myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;corporate-zen&#34;&gt;Corporate Zen?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn is littered with professional folks wanting to perform a crazy
kind of motivational speech. It&amp;rsquo;s both odd and unsurprising to see
corporate dweebs quote Buddha (or some ancient wise person), &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve
reached zen in what I do.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is baffling! How could one attain peace working in an environment
bereft of factors that would make it possible? If you&amp;rsquo;re finding harmony
in working for profit, you&amp;rsquo;re probably on the top 1% of the top 1%. And
in that case, there&amp;rsquo;s something very wrong with you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sticky Rainy Season</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/195/</link>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finished a book and added it to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/books&#34;&gt;booklist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Days ago, &amp;rsquo;twas the season of sunburn and heatstroke. Earth&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere
has its own climate to warp, though, adding tropical storms into the
mix. PAG-ASA says we&amp;rsquo;re now entering the rainy season. With uneasy
stickiness and more violent turbulence. The answer to either is varying
degrees of &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/travel&#34;&gt;travel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find the recent nights a little quieter than usual. That is, until the
adjacent barangay makes a public announcement in intervals. They speak
in sad language&amp;mdash;of curfews that should be followed by kids whose
energy we adults have little to no business bottling up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the month of May 2024, I only listened intentionally to one album:
&lt;em&gt;SEYCHELLES&lt;/em&gt; by Masayoshi Takanaka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;Is there a song that you need to experience&amp;mdash;see the artist and hear
them sing&amp;mdash;live in your lifetime and exclaim, &amp;ldquo;Void, take me now for I am
complete&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even I don&amp;rsquo;t know the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Do androids dream of electric sheep?</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/194/</link>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finished a book and added it to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/books&#34;&gt;booklist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philip K. Dick&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&lt;/em&gt; is a sci-fi
dystopia that tackles many things all at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently finished the book, and below are some of my non-spoiler
notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With today&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/technology&#34;&gt;tech&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s darling, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/ai&#34;&gt;AI&lt;/a&gt; still being one
of the hot topics to talk about, I wonder if it would reach a certain
level that it&amp;rsquo;s deemed smart enough to be installed in a humanoid
robot&amp;mdash;an android&amp;mdash;and we would not tell the difference?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If AI would be the soul, what would be the flesh? Are we making
strides in bioengineering technology that could create human-like
flesh from, say, 3D bioprinting?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Humankind is gradually becoming more emotionally mature as a
collective. That&amp;rsquo;s why, for example, compared to thousands of years
before, slavery is now frowned upon. Will we reach then a future in
which humans become smart enough yet emotionally stunted that they
have to invent a &amp;ldquo;mood organ&amp;rdquo; to select which emotions to feel at any
particular time, to feel some sort of enlightenment?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think not having children of my own isn&amp;rsquo;t dropping out of
humankind. There are many other ways to participate, not just in
continuing our biological evolution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the book, there are empathy tests to which suspected androids can be
subjected to determine whether they are indeed one. Will AI get
so good that it would pass such tests?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Empire accelerates the doom of all living things regardless of their
value in profit- and power-seeking endeavors. As long as it remains
above us all, it is entropy&amp;rsquo;s ugly form-destroying chunk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does it feel to work with an adversary while taking down, or at
least hoping to, other adversaries? Imagine no more: &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/activism&#34;&gt;life of activists&lt;/a&gt; under empire is rife with these conflicts. Even so, it&amp;rsquo;s important to employ as many strategies as possible, but more so, to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/revolution&#34;&gt;think beyond what lives and worlds are possible beyond the current systems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why is it that it&amp;rsquo;s common for people to reward themselves with an
expensive Thing after doing or accomplishing someting Important? To
boost morale?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s both heartbraking and incensing to hear the motives of
contemporaries from Global North who outsource (or &amp;ldquo;delegate&amp;rdquo;) their
unwanted tasks to workers in Global South on the cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/capitalism&#34;&gt;Capitalism&lt;/a&gt; incentivizes these
entrepreneurs to seek profit, and encourages them to think that their
time is worth more than those of us here. This line of thinking helps
perpetuate Empire&amp;rsquo;s machine, &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; while having their best lives and not
losing sleep over any of it, because, they say, it&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;ldquo;win-win for
everyone.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More shocking to me is that this comes from a person-of-color. I guess,
capitalist-wannabes need to be diverse, too!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the time, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know how to react when you told me that you, a
hypothetical somebody who leads a large team of people, would rather be
a Big Player&amp;rsquo;s one-shot entertainment if it meant accelerating your
career up the ladder. What happened to choosing dignity and maintaining
that it&amp;rsquo;s the wiser decision?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Your body aches a few moments after waking up. Not all temples have the
sanctity to preserve itself all, or even most of, the time. Sometimes,
somewhere within, something upsets the body&amp;rsquo;s balance for no apparent
reason other than just bad luck. It&amp;rsquo;s a bad day: grey clouds loom; the
atmospher leaves the marginalized in a daze; and you&amp;mdash;hips, muscles,
spirit&amp;mdash;are in discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pain reminds you of the limited time here on earth, but try not to
overcomplicate the feeing. It would not evolve on its own. You feel for
the points where the fluorescence are brightest, and adjust the motion
of joints based on which gait is less blinding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You find a rhythm. And with it you continue your day, and even finding
the time to walk the dog because all of you deserve to be out in the
night.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>When people talk about their deceased loved ones</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/190/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;People are inclined to create a mythology around loved ones who are
dead, and these stories, in my experience, are getting harder to vet the
more the time passes. On one hand, I get it, of course&amp;mdash;we want to
respect the dead by mostly associating them with good memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m left with patina&amp;rsquo;d golden idols on pedestals,
all of which I can&amp;rsquo;t talk to nor question to know them on a deeper
level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder how it would be like to know them through my own lens; and why
the hell am I always late in meeting the (seemingly?) cool people before
they died. I also wonder&amp;mdash;and this sounds egotistical&amp;mdash;if I would get
to that level where people in the future would feel bad for not having
met me before I die, the same way I feel for these deceased loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I go deep into the night, I find myself looking up on basic
photography lessons that leverage smartphone cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crash courses that I like say that gear almost always never matter.
This is because constraints forces the photographer to be more creative.
More important than camera is knowing how to compose a shot. COMPOSITION
IS KEY.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Need to be Quiet</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/187/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 08 May 2024 03:53:12 +0800</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;LUNCH TIME&amp;mdash;food came in great and piping hot, and everyone was at
their places wolfing down meats and talking about business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After eating, the next most obvious thing was to wash the oil with
coffee. And the leader of the band facilitated the informal discussion
with a few spicy questions that we were supposed to answer one by one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it didn&amp;rsquo;t feel right when she, the leader, had to look at my
direction and point out that I&amp;rsquo;m quiet with an undertone that somehow
it&amp;rsquo;s an undesirable trait. Honestly, it caught me off guard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I could&amp;rsquo;ve done (non-exhaustive list):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Say firmly, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m a quiet person&amp;rdquo; and leave it at that. Or quickly add,
if I&amp;rsquo;m looking for a fight that day, &amp;ldquo;&amp;mdash;around people I don&amp;rsquo;t like.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just say, &amp;ldquo;Yes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I did:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nothing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If silence amplifies the anxiety of loud talkers, then I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to
cause any more discomfort by escalating it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been around people who have been genuinely concerned, though, when
I&amp;rsquo;m abnormally quiet. I can imagine that they&amp;rsquo;re only worried I might be
upset or something wrong happened. To diffuse any worries in that
situation, I respond with &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m fine&amp;rdquo; which may or may not be
true, but getting into it at that moment wouldn&amp;rsquo;t solve anything.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Let&#39;s Go!</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/186/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 06 May 2024 07:33:41 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/186/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I rediscovered the sitcom &lt;em&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s Go!&lt;/em&gt; in Youtube, a 2006 ABS-CBN show
about a group of college kids navigating the college life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I am again at year 2006. Somehow my world looks simpler but only
because I remain oblivious to both the more beautiful and more horrible
things going on around me that are not explicitly taught in school or
are not being shared among my social circles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future&amp;mdash;about 18 years from now&amp;mdash;I might say to myself that as
we grow older, we believe more that simplicity is a function of time.
But I don&amp;rsquo;t know that yet. And hasn&amp;rsquo;t the universe always been vibrant?
Nature, also, the local earth version of it, at least, is lively beyond
our simplest imaginations, no matter how we perceive it. It is 2006.
What is simpler? How can things be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wake up refreshed a nap (as I do) when I decide to turn on the TV to
see what&amp;rsquo;s on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s Go!&lt;/em&gt; is what I stumble upon this Saturday afternoon. The
characters have the fashion sense of the common folk in this time: shirt
and jeans, shirt and skirt, and/or the most obnoxious accessories that
yell mid 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pay attention to the quirks of each character, trying not to cringe at
the unfunny jokes that I&amp;rsquo;m sure could have been written better to make
me laugh. But, really, as long as there are traces of humor in it, it&amp;rsquo;s
fine. I&amp;rsquo;m here to enjoy the show, to imagine myself as one of the
misfits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actors look very Pinoy and not mestizos and mestizas. At least that
part the show&amp;rsquo;s producers got right.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Family is spooky</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/185/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 04 May 2024 01:45:14 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/185/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited Index page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;family-lately&#34;&gt;Family, lately&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Family is scary because they are made up of people one is bound to grow
apart from, and during this time of growing distance, people change
towards multiple directions the effects to the familial ties one can&amp;rsquo;t
even begin to imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, we embrace change. At least, we try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those times that I think I can&amp;rsquo;t face an impending change, I study
the term &amp;ldquo;devil&amp;rdquo; as it may be useful when describing the part of self
that attempts to court its own ruin as well as the potential effects to
those near [and/or dear (&amp;ldquo;family&amp;rdquo;)].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Family is spooky, because it is willing to implode when it starts
discussing inheritance. So when I refer to the devil playing a part in
this, ask: am I really hinting at the religious concepts, or something
more human?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dream-last-night&#34;&gt;Dream last night&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a snowy night. Everything covered in white seemed to be glowing
softly despite having no street lamps outside. I looked out the window
and saw two columns of mushroom clouds: the farthest was already at its
peak formation; the nearest was about 30 meters away, still climbing its
way up to its zenith. Then came the shockwaves, better late than never,
shattering glass and teeth. Finally entered the terror that our house
would probably be bombed next. The body heat was increasing because of
anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is my end,&amp;rdquo; I said. &amp;ldquo;I thought I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be afraid to die, but
everyday I learn new things about myself.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Objective Reality</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/184/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is there an absolute objective reality when all observations depend on
the observer measuring the [behavior of the] object? I know for a fact
that no human observer can be fully objective; we will always carry our
own biases and lived experiences in the work we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the month of Apr 2024, these are the albums I listened to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Album Name&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Artist&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Pieces of a Man&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Gil Scott-Heron&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Three Sacred Souls&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Three Sacred Souls&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Prelude to Ecstasy&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;The Last Dinner Party&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Only God Was Above Us&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Vampire Weekend&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;internet dump&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;cosmic collective&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Vampire fan since their first album, their latest &lt;em&gt;Only God Was
Above Us&lt;/em&gt; felt new yet familiar, with Ezra Koenig still as the main
vocals. Myopic me did not have the foresight that an album was coming
when &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/169/#music&#34;&gt;they dropped two songs last Feb 2024&lt;/a&gt;, which in
itself is a blessing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever felt that you started something that went bigger than
you&amp;rsquo;d expect it to be? People have begun consuming it, even integrating
parts of it in their daily lives, wishing for it, becoming &lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt; without
knowing its roots&amp;mdash;you, a mean meme machine before it was even a
thing, the fertile soil from which this hypothetical thing bloomed and
flourished. Of course, those who are witnessing it are not interested in
the origin story. Understandable. They are here and now, with the
intention of joining the cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-lost-is-transformed-actually&#34;&gt;What is lost is transformed, actually&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lost loves, encompassing all kinds, or the idea of love being lost has
to be anchored to something oppressive and possessive that fears the
importance of liberation. Like energy, what we know as love can only be
transformed from one kind to another. If this exists&amp;mdash;and I have all
the reasons that it does&amp;mdash;it would only cease to exist if all life with
some signifcant level of emotional intelligence to experience it also
ceases to exist. Without all the actors and observers, the reality
within which love is experienced will not matter.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Improve, not remove, the bike lane</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/182/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Apr 2024 02:34:38 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/182/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last time that I went several cities south and saw my relatives there, they
were astonished when they found out that I got there on my bike. It&amp;rsquo;s
about 28 kilometers one way&amp;mdash;challenging, but doable if one is
physically and mentally prepared for it, which I was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of them scoffed at me, &amp;ldquo;Just because you can doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you
should.&amp;rdquo; They&amp;rsquo;re implying that cycling in major thoroughfares&amp;mdash;even
with bike lanes&amp;mdash;is hazardous in Metro Manila. All the more that I
should keep on cycling when and where I can, because doing so sends out
a message, and it is this: &lt;em&gt;We need better infrastructure for all types
of mobility that aren&amp;rsquo;t motor or electric vehicles&lt;/em&gt;. Pedestrians, of
course, suffer the most when their&amp;mdash;&lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;welfare is sidelined to
just an afterthought in urban planning, largely implemented by those
that don&amp;rsquo;t understand it fully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t help that, as reported by PhilStar Global,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.philstar.com/nation/2024/04/24/2350078/mmda-mulls-removing-bicycle-lane-edsa&#34;&gt;MMDA mulls removing bicycle lane from EDSA&lt;/a&gt;, because it&amp;rsquo;s being &amp;ldquo;underutilized.&amp;rdquo;
Plans like this, from a government agency no less, derail the inclusive
mobility that many groups have been pushing for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rappler.com/nation/metro-manila/mmda-report-cyclists-edsa/&#34;&gt;Rappler also reports&lt;/a&gt;:
&amp;ldquo;Only 1,500 cyclists on EDSA daily, says MMDA. Another bike count says it’s more like 7,000.&amp;rdquo;
This makes me wonder how MMDA gathers their &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/data-management&#34;&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; and
the ways they ensure its integrity, before using it in implementing
projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; continue to ride my bike when and where I can, as both the
messenger and &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; message.
And if something bad happens to me out there while riding despite:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;riding defensively;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wearing helmet with a side mirror attached to it; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;having head and tail lights; then&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s because the message demands more blood before it gets
properly noticed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hello from Hell and Hiatus</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/181/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 21 Apr 2024 06:17:25 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/181/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello again, after an almost two-week hiatus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt; to have the simplest and most boring workflow, because, I think,
it&amp;rsquo;s more sustainable for me. But no, life demands variability and
volatility. This is achieved with Father Time increasing entropy across
the board, and Mother Nature promising chaos to thrive in all levels of
existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ador-status&#34;&gt;Ador Status&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My personal laptop, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/64&#34;&gt;Ador&lt;/a&gt;, on which I do personal things, like
updating the files for this blog, has been wiped clean, because of my
committing several noob errors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Installing Alpine Linux edge as main production, which is
discouraged; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not doing regular back-up of my data and files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the days that followed setting Ador back up, I went
distro-[s]hopping, trying to find the right one. So, I went through the
usual suspects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fedora (too bloated)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arch (hard drive encryption not working somehow?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OpenBSD (keyboard not working and/or stuck in boot)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I eventually cycled back to Alpine Linux, stable version. I&amp;rsquo;m avoiding
anything bleeding edge in computing devices right now,
where software incompatibility can and will break the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am still sulking at the loss of my semi-important files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reading-many-books-at-once&#34;&gt;Reading many books at once&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, while I was still setting up Ador, I took to reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading 3 or 4 different books simultaneously has given me the ability
to connect ideas across them, possibly creating new innovative ideas, at
least interesting thoughts to discuss with peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And annotation! Why haven&amp;rsquo;t I done that before?
Taking notes about the text I am reading is like having a conversation
with the ideas or interacting with the plots.
And I feel like since I&amp;rsquo;m doing it the analog way, i.e. with physical
books, pen and sticky notes, reading doesn&amp;rsquo;t get too boring too quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Thinking and Feeling</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s the unbearable heat that is upon us that&amp;rsquo;s making me
re-evaluate my positions in life lately. You see, I can&amp;rsquo;t think without
feeling and feel without thinking. Thinking and feeling are often
separated in modern discourse. Some people assume that it&amp;rsquo;s healthy to
air-gap emotion from reason. I was from this camp, but I&amp;rsquo;m now slowly
unlearning that needless division. Supposedly, the brain&amp;rsquo;s operation
should be isolated from that of the heart&amp;rsquo;s, but even anatomically, that
doesn&amp;rsquo;t spell good; one needs the other to work well. We want them to
work well. If/when I experience joy, I imagine it would be akin to
setting my feelings and thoughts on fire, weeding out the old to make
way for new transformations, the ashes a fertile ground for newer ways
of Being.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Walk in Manila</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/179/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2024 02:26:46 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/179/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many of the parts we walked along in Ermita and Malate in Manila City
smell bad. So many streets have been neglected, save for the trees who
are always generous with their shade, no matter what they are or from
which crack they have been growing, empowering us to walk in the first
place despite the afternoon heat. (As always, thank you, trees!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With care and attention, the city, as with most urban places, has the
potential to look more beautiful, if not for the adults, for the kids
who deserve to live in a more habitable place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city&amp;rsquo;s local government unit (LGU) can start by cleaning the
sidewalks and actually allotting them solely to pedestrians. Of
&lt;em&gt;fucking&lt;/em&gt; course, expecting LGUs to do that is like waiting for the sun
to rise in Manila Bay; one would rather do the latter. LGUs&amp;rsquo; motivation
relies heavily in keeping the status quo or enforcing some
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/violence&#34;&gt;violence&lt;/a&gt; against the common folk. Keeping the city&amp;mdash;all
cities, everywhere&amp;mdash;may not just be the most important agenda for the
statespeople, unless it&amp;rsquo;s their own personal backyard. It&amp;rsquo;s up to the
citizens to keep their personal and communal spaces tidy, and hopefully
encourage their neighbors to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the show &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417299/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avatar: The Last Airbender&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Zuko, one of the
main characters, was taught Breath of Fire, a firebending technique that
would keep him warm in super cold environments, giving him the chance to
survive them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &amp;ldquo;breath of fire&amp;rdquo; is &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/155&#34;&gt;muzak&lt;/a&gt;, more specifically in
singing, even if I&amp;rsquo;m not really good at it. It has
metaphorically kept me warm through the cold, harsh realities of modern
life, as if the elders had held me in their blazing love.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Attending a car show</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/177/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 05 Apr 2024 05:11:03 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/177/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As an avid car disliker, be it the combustion or the much-hyped electric
types, attending the Manila International Auto Show (MIAS), for work no
less, led me to experience a dissonance for most of the day, one that
would eventually manifest itself in a splitting migraine. To be fair,
the migraine stemmed from other sources as well, like heat, dehydration,
hunger, fatigue&amp;mdash;things that one must avoid while living in the
tropics, but which I tackled head on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;m more of a bicycle enjoyer, so nothing there seemed relatable
in MIAS, not even the &amp;ldquo;sustainable&amp;rdquo; electric vehicles that would
supposedly &amp;ldquo;change the game.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Didn&amp;rsquo;t we just go through a heavy traffic jam on our way
there? So why would people want to add more cars in the road?
Of course, we know that the answer to that is as clear as the summer
skies in an Early April morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there&amp;rsquo;s a bicycle convention, could I
pitch it to our management that we attend that, too?
I&amp;rsquo;m sure that it would get much less traction.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I feel there&amp;rsquo;s a fog looming all around me, and it&amp;rsquo;s affecting my mood
all the time. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what it is. It&amp;rsquo;s like the anti-thesis of Tao
in that its omnipresence is the destructive type that slow-burns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had little patience listening on things I&amp;rsquo;m not interested in this
day. The future should be degrowth, a notion that will surely be shot
down at work. All the more we must talk about that, even if the
words come out of my mouth garbled!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stepping into my 4th decade</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/175/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 31 Mar 2024 02:23:53 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/175/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Peak Aries season&amp;mdash;my people is deemed to be a chaotic bunch. I don&amp;rsquo;t
disagree: I myself am a self-proclaimed &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/26/#chaotic-good&#34;&gt;chaotic good&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chewing-on-past-three-decades-in-few-paragraphs&#34;&gt;Chewing on past three decades in few paragraphs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people around my age would claim that 90s is the best decade ever,
and often they would wonder why it had to end? For me, that&amp;rsquo;s a bold
claim to make. I understand that some of the good parts are
really good in my opinion,
but there&amp;rsquo;s no real way for me to say for sure that is
&lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; best years. I was, in fact, too young to know anything, save for
the courage to daydream, to project unto the world what I had imagined
in my silly head as a child from a relatively poor family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been bored most of my life, and ancient wisdom suggests that it&amp;rsquo;s
okay for one to be so. Boredom forces the mind to create something from
scratch. Too, I have been a boring person. As a mild people-pleaser,
I claim that this inert dullness comes from years of
practicing &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/68/#on-time&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;wu wei&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but to be honest, I&amp;rsquo;m stretching it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One friend&amp;mdash;bless their sharp words for they heal&amp;mdash;said, indirectly,
that what I&amp;rsquo;m feeling, this sense of helplessness and wanting to move
but unable to, can be correlated to my lack of community that inspires
and motivates me. Well, I hope it&amp;rsquo;s not too late to join, maintain,
or create new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;artificial-eclipse&#34;&gt;Artificial Eclipse&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know if there&amp;rsquo;s a term for this phenomenon, but for now, let&amp;rsquo;s
call it Artificial Eclipse, and is as follows: when the observer, who is
usually in a moving body (e.g., car, train, vehicle, ship, etc.) is
trying to look at a static object in the distance (e.g., billboard,
building, tree, etc.), but a second closer &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; moving object (blocker) blocks
the view. The blocker keeps on eclipsing the view as it moves at a rate
relative to the observer. It becomes [mildly?] infuriating for the
observer when the view they were trying to look at is no longer within
field of vision for some reason, usually because they have moved past it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>First Tattoo</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It took me three decades to get my first tattoo, and I&amp;rsquo;m proud to have
waited that long before getting one. I feel like this was the right time
to have it. I may or may not post a picture of it online, but I can
describe it for you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a black cat, patterned to our very own resident black cat,
wearing the petals of rafflesia leonardi around its
neck. A decorative oval frames the feline with the forelegs
stretching outside the frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I&amp;rsquo;ll get more tattoos&amp;hellip; but I do have a spread in
my journal dedicated to some ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Losing</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/173/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;farewell-lola-mila&#34;&gt;Farewell, Lola Mila&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lola Milagros Olarte (LM) passed away this week, at the age of 88.
As with most things suddenly occurring, shock came in spurts&amp;mdash;manageable,
almost transactional. It&amp;rsquo;s odd to put it that way, but this is true
because I have been growing away from the matriarch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She wasn&amp;rsquo;t the kindest abuela there ever was to say the least. Like many
people of her time, she had a lot of unresolved trauma brought about by
wars and abuses: as local as her blood family and as societal as the
political landscape that came and went. Hurt people hurt people, we
know, despite them having religiously read during their lifetime the
Holy Scripture. Sadly, LM had reproduced the harm she experienced, and
the people closest to her were the most affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally am a receiver of her physical abuse, an unwanted core
memory that&amp;rsquo;s nigh impossible to delete, even after all these years.
To forgive, I won&amp;rsquo;t forget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time wounds all heels, i.e, entropy&amp;rsquo;s idea at the back of mind empowers
anyone to realize that everything will be delivered to it. Random
vagueness is the end state of the void, and that none of the hurt now
will matter then. So why not focus on other things?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last mass for LM felt rushed. Very few songs were played and sang. I
give the priest&amp;rsquo;s homily 2 hostias out of 10: it lacked the wisdom and
the ferocity that LM had. Mourners weren&amp;rsquo;t given their moments to say
their last words to the departed, although I&amp;rsquo;m not sure whether doing so
is a &amp;ldquo;proper&amp;rdquo; Catholic way. &lt;em&gt;If&lt;/em&gt; such segment were there, I&amp;rsquo;d dedicate
the 2nd paragraph of this post to LM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;losing-wits&#34;&gt;Losing wits?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something seems to be happening to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No other way to put it: I feel I&amp;rsquo;m getting dumber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this the effect of all the bad things happening around the world? Is
this the air quality and the noise pollution of urban cities that I am
absorbing everyday? Is this the heat that slow-cooks my flesh and
nerves? When annihilation arrives, do I use the last dregs of energy to fuck
things up and find out if interesting things would bloom?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the bereavement, someone close to me reprimanded me to stop
intellectualizing things like my emotions when I should be feeling them
first, before anything else. I agree&amp;mdash;but how can I do that when many
times, there&amp;rsquo;s just static up there? That, and the squishy primordial soup
that misinterprets scents as stolen memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;playing-small&#34;&gt;Playing small&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does &amp;ldquo;playing small&amp;rdquo; have to be framed poorly?
Playing small, if anything, is more sustainable in the long run:
anything that&amp;rsquo;s worth doing is worth doing, no matter the pace and scale.
Don&amp;rsquo;t let some entrepreneurial fake guru and/or some conservative
politician tell you otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s okay to feel contented in solving small [daily] problems without
profit incentive. It&amp;rsquo;s okay to do small deeds. These small things are
what actually maintain the joy in humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Change of Guards</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/172/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 17 Mar 2024 06:46:26 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/172/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first time I was fully present in changing of guards was
&lt;a href=&#34;https://seekers.araw.xyz/taiwan-part1/&#34;&gt;when we were in Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;. The choreography was both intense and fluid. To a lesser
extent, the recent changes in household members feels similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some nights now, I have been having a whirlwind of dreams related to
educational institutions, and how in many of them, I had either failed
or barely escaped my failure. Because of these, my sleep has been
slightly off. If I were to interpret: I feel I don&amp;rsquo;t seek social
validation like I used to, and my brain is telling me, &amp;ldquo;Please do!
You&amp;rsquo;re a social creature. And do it in the form of getting into grad
school.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Left Hand of Darkness</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/171/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 16 Mar 2024 05:29:27 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/171/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/books&#34;&gt;Books&lt;/a&gt; list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me a while to finish this sci-fi book by Ursula K. Le Guin, not because
it&amp;rsquo;s a hard read. I was careful to read through it, like walking across
fields of Ice, even annotating the text to capture the dialogue and/or
conversation I had with the story. Below are some of my notes, which may
or may not contain spoilers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While Le Guin, as is her task as a sci-fi&amp;mdash;really, &lt;em&gt;speculative
fiction&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;defamiliarizes the world with new environment and people,
she grounds us with important questions regarding gender fluidity and
how it affects social relations. Beyond predictions, this &amp;ldquo;report&amp;rdquo;
aims to answer as many what-ifs as it can to reimagine what is
possible in &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; world here and now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something may factually be correct, but unless told with a compelling
narrative, it runs the risk of not being received well, if at all. The
inverse is also true.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As someone who values &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/privacy&#34;&gt;privacy&lt;/a&gt;, I wonder what would happen
if one of my closest friends became a famous celebrity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To become a &lt;del&gt;full&lt;/del&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/fascism&#34;&gt;fool patriot&lt;/a&gt;, one must love one&amp;rsquo;s nation
&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; fear others. Some would use the word &lt;em&gt;hate&lt;/em&gt; instead of &lt;em&gt;fear&lt;/em&gt;,
but don&amp;rsquo;t they stem from the same seed? Patriots tend to become
fascists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mad things we do for Love should not have to end in pain or harm or
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/violence&#34;&gt;violence&lt;/a&gt;, for then it is not Love, but a polystyrene,
toxic version of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlearning things that have had no good effects to anyone peel the
folds of unwanted beliefs. This act reveals more of ourselves.
Unlearning becomes learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why does someone from a supposed advanced civilization use Imperial
System when Metric System is easier to understand elsewhere and thus
far superior? Is it because the author is American, and Le Guin could
not be bothered to switch systems? Or does the author think that in
the future, space-traveling humans would all agree to use Imperial
Units? Will these space-travelers be Americans?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a harsh reality with an even harsher climate, everything seems
disagreeable. What would make the struggle worth it if not the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/friendship&#34;&gt;friends we meet and the families&lt;/a&gt; we choose along the way?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The magic/miracle of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansible&#34;&gt;ansible&lt;/a&gt;
is no magic, no miracle, for it relies on a very human thing:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/communication&#34;&gt;communication&lt;/a&gt;. And since, not everyone is open to
it, building better worlds will always be a challenge, no matter when
we are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;To oppose something is to maintain it.&amp;rdquo; A bold claim; I wonder why.
Maybe opposing is not enough. Perhaps we need to obsolete the thing we
oppose somehow if we want it to stop existing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s okay to not trust all people. To those we distrust, are we fully
closing all possibilities of meeting them halfway, of understanding
the differences, of finding common ground?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When something can neither be proved nor disproved, the chance to
learn still lies between the spaces of people who have participated in
the discussion. This is a good start at community building.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fear is an effective tool to sway people into dis/believeing
something/someone. Will there be a time that we won&amp;rsquo;t be needing it?
Or is it really an essential yet exploitable human trait?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I feel out of place, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to emotionally and mentally
navigate the space (or void) between people. I&amp;rsquo;d rather be physically
lost in a place with friends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s often agreed that Time is an important non-renewable source among
living things. And among those with a certain maturity,
there is another: Kindness. Where, when, how, why to even source that?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a blessing/curse to have no say where and when one gets born. But
if it were possible to choose, would it be worth it? Will there be any
reward to this Life of Lesser Risks?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to think about whether Taoism would exist elsewhere.
Is the concept of Tao inevitable?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/revolution&#34;&gt;Revolution&lt;/a&gt; that outdates the Empire requires us to
acknowledge that change has to be personal and political before it can
ripple outwards.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Blip on the line of dread</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/170/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For more than a week, days had been a blur of dread laced with a bit of
good times. Escaping dread is akin to escaping the pull of its gravity:
it&amp;rsquo;s only possible with the help of external forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still in the orbits&amp;mdash;or they in mine&amp;mdash;of &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/169&#34;&gt;problematic old men&lt;/a&gt;, and it&amp;rsquo;s emotionally and mentally exhausting to deal with
them, even if it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; small talk. Patriarchy disallows men to process
their feelings, which is just unfortunate for everyone around those who
believe that shite. My partner observes that it&amp;rsquo;s easier to burst into
rage, but it comes with a destructive cost. It&amp;rsquo;s harder to remain
collected while standing your ground, but this is more sustainable in
the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On other news, I rode my bike more than 20 kms south to a city of
my childhood memories, which I had trouble recognizing with all the
&amp;ldquo;progress&amp;rdquo;-induced metamorphosis, to visit a loved one who&amp;rsquo;s currently
in ICU. Then, I caught with some family matters with other visiting
relatives. Finally, I met with old friends for dinner, a spontaneous
gathering that seems to happen once in a lifetime. Thanks to one of my
friends, I &amp;ldquo;rode&amp;rdquo; back home via their car, my bike cramped with me
inside. All of these happened within 12 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yo, if you&amp;rsquo;re a cis-hetero man over the age of 60, why do you have to
make everything about you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, if I squint hard enough, I could see the details of your
troubled past, the struggles your people had had to go through to
survive. I could piece together some clues, but who wants to go
through all that when a better alternative, taking in the form of
cutting ties, is within arm&amp;rsquo;s reach?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To you, I say: we all need to be responsible with how we express our
courage while keeping in mind not to glorify sacrifice. Doing the latter
is a macho thing, i.e., thing of the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the month of Feb 2024, these are the albums I listened to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Album Name&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Artist&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;The System Works for Them&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Aus Rotten&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Spiritual Paralysis&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Hexsystem&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Forest Floor&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Fergus McCreadie&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Jazz&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Queen&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Capricorn/Gen-X Corps&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Vampire Weekend&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Sleep&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Ruru&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All good albums so far, and it&amp;rsquo;s hard to pick a favorite for this month:
Aus Rotten always got me agitated in a good way; &lt;em&gt;Spiritual Paralysis&lt;/em&gt;
doesn&amp;rsquo;t demand too much of your focus but when you make the effort, you
will be rewarded with dream-like sequences that soothes the tired
corpo brain; the whole &lt;em&gt;Jazz&lt;/em&gt; is shamelessly glamorous.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reggae&#34;&gt;Reggae&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, I listened to a reggae playlist when something in me was
triggered after hearing a snippet of it. The genre, when I first heard
of it, immediately made sense to me, like I was finally coming home from
a tiring journey and a loved one greeted me with a warm bowl of &lt;em&gt;sinigang&lt;/em&gt;.
It&amp;rsquo;s been long, but the cozy, warm feeling lingers, the one that can
only be felt in the tropics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fire-in-the-neighborhood&#34;&gt;Fire in the neighborhood&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have finally been in a relatively small street filled with firetrucks
from end to end. They came from nearby districts, firefighters aboard
and ready to fight fire, if only fire weren&amp;rsquo;t out still by the time they
arrive. But the first few responders were quick to get to the scene that
the fire hadn&amp;rsquo;t had the chance to grow to an unmanageable monster. Which
was a good thing! This neighborhood is so dense, that people will be
rightfully alarmed when they see a smoke from somewhere where there
shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For example&lt;/em&gt;, when a housemate burns dried leaves and twigs to &amp;ldquo;shoo away
mosquitoes,&amp;rdquo; (a debunked myth, btw) neighbors &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; call the local village
council to check it. A plume of smoke&amp;mdash;an irregular occurrence in this
part of the urban mess&amp;mdash;coming out of an old house and lot
will always look like a real threat, never a drill to laugh at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;existential-musing-of-the-week&#34;&gt;Existential musing of the week&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is brought to you by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an attempt by a random stranger to make my existing status unalive
via fake-crashing into the motorcycle taxi I was on; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the [plate] number&amp;hellip; no, sorry, I didn&amp;rsquo;t catch the plate number. I
was busy thinking of my life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My rider, like 99%
of motorcycle riders, thought it would save us time to counter-flow.
This random person, who probably woke up with a bad tooth, did not like
seeing two-wheels counter-flowing against their lane, which is
understandable. What escaped me is, why did they have to fake-swerve into 3
or 4 riders, including us? If this mad driver did clip us, I wonder
where I am now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had no control over all of this; I was just a passenger who kept calm
despite all the flares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this life is all there is, I told myself, I acknowledge its inherent
flaws and try to learn from them for as long as I can.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I seem peaceful...</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/167/</link>

      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/167/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always been an angry person despite the timid fleshy shell. Getting
this emotion under control remains a challenge daily that not even yoga,
meditation, or just plain zoning out could fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bad idea behind unloading the negative energy on an adversary is in
thinking that violence&amp;mdash;physical, emotional, or some other
form&amp;mdash;however justified (what even is?) can be leveraged to &amp;ldquo;get even&amp;rdquo;.
In reality, it burns anything it touches. If I&amp;rsquo;m always trying to
level the field, what collateral damage, if any, am I avoiding? Even
when I&amp;rsquo;m answering that question for myself, it&amp;rsquo;s hard; I&amp;rsquo;m almost never
kind to the man in the mirror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this rage sometimes encourage me to pray for the unalive status, I
mean it as a value statement, not a factual one. What I could have meant
is, I want this life to have less of the things that trigger it, to
ironically distance me a forest-fire away from the unwanted, unnecessary
suffering. I accept, of course, that this is wishful thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will always be a work in progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The birds perched on bamboo stilts, they call me early. I can feel their
dawn songs churning the sweetness in my guts. I know they are not for
me, but I owe them my gratitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do I deserve, then, if not the simplicity of avian muzak? I only
have naive takes on the matter based on my limited experience living
here on earth&amp;mdash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We deserve to live our best lives that don&amp;rsquo;t involve the suffering of
others. That seems like a given, but with the wars the are going on,
many dangerous ideas compel people to hurt Others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living our best lives might mean expressing love on Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day, but
we all know that when we decide to opt in to the 14-Feb gimmicks, it is
also keeping the fad in motion. Surely&amp;mdash;and we know this&amp;mdash;love,
eternal and radical, cannot be contained in a single point in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to believe that there&amp;rsquo;s enough wiggle room to build and maintain
meaningful relationships, to look alive in search for joy beneath the
rage if we haven&amp;rsquo;t seen it yet, even when we&amp;rsquo;re thrown to more
soul-crushing systems that push us to be more aloof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are long gone, because death warps the concept of time. Still, we
remember your &lt;em&gt;lambing&lt;/em&gt; because you were so generous of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We miss you, Eddie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could only wish to have given you the companionship you deserved.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chinese New Year 2024 with Friends</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/164/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 11 Feb 2024 08:48:50 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/164/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited intro in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And other minor design edits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long weekend&amp;mdash;and for that I have the Chinese New Year to thank.
Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t a typical weekend last &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; 3 whole days? It would be
nice to have a whole day for chores, a whole day for personal matters
and/or rest, and a whole day dedicated for families and friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;rsquo;m grateful for &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/friendship&#34;&gt;having friends&lt;/a&gt;, wherever, whenever they are,
because they make me a better version of myself. I can only hope I&amp;rsquo;m
doing the same for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, though, I hurt people, which would happen less if I were being
sensitive to my own grit. Even if I don&amp;rsquo;t intend to, it happens. Part of
growing as a person is recognizing when it does, and owning up to it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Words I looked up</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/163/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 04 Feb 2024 16:28:06 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/163/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added sections to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/wiki-meta&#34;&gt;Wiki Meta&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;apple-vision-pro&#34;&gt;Apple Vision Pro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, Apple Vision Pro is out now, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if it&amp;rsquo;s
already available here in the country as of writing this. Tech Youtuber
Marques Brownlee (AKA MKBHD) recently released a series of videos
reviewing Apple&amp;rsquo;s overpriced version of a virtual reality headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My bias against Apple has me asking, &amp;ldquo;How &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/repair&#34;&gt;repairable&lt;/a&gt; is it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iFixit &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ifixit.com/News/89360/apples-vision-pro-will-almost-certainly-not-be-repairable-or-even-openable&#34;&gt;published an article&lt;/a&gt; back in Jan 2024
about the device&amp;rsquo;s repairability, and to summarize, the author was very
skeptical about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;words-i-looked-up&#34;&gt;Words I looked up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is inspired by &lt;a href=&#34;https://tracydurnell.com/2024/02/02/weeknotes-jan-27-feb-2-2024/&#34;&gt;Tracy Durnell&amp;rsquo;s Weeknotes&lt;/a&gt; in which she has a section with the same name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my version, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to use each word in a sentence (&lt;em&gt;o pangungusap
kung Tagalog&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;temerity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;excessive boldness&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use in a sentence (UIAS): &amp;ldquo;I blame our State&amp;rsquo;s temerity to make no
effort in keeping you well-fed here, Mr. and Mrs. P, so much so for you
to uproot your life here in search for a better one there; it won&amp;rsquo;t be
easy, so might as well give them hell as soon you&amp;rsquo;ve found your
footing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;repudiated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;disowned&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UIAS: &amp;ldquo;The choice to live is rather anti-climactic; for some, it&amp;rsquo;s
repudiated the moment something in them clicks, an idea that now makes
perfect sense.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;nadadalumat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;kinakayang mag-isip nang malalim&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gamitin sa pangungusap: &amp;ldquo;Sa kakaibang panaginip ko lang nadadalumat ang
posibilidad na kaya ni Moo na upakan ang maitim na budhi ni Zed-zed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;obdurate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;hardhearted&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UIAS: &amp;ldquo;Zed-zed remains obdurate on keeping Moo unbothered for at least
one whole hour!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;effrontery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;shameless audacity&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UIAS: &amp;ldquo;My effrontery thus far has had you invested sans thy consent
about my spiels on Moo and Zed-zed, but deep inside, you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; care,
because they are cats.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Note-sharing on birds chirping</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/162/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2024 05:06:37 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/162/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added a whole new section, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/wiki&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wiki&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or my Super Second Brain.
It contains my notes on many different topics that I&amp;rsquo;m now making
semi-public.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On that note, I added the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/wiki-meta&#34;&gt;Wiki Meta&lt;/a&gt; project page to
briefly outline the implementation (read: hack) of this wiki.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And other minor edits for aesthetics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This quick update brings attention to the way the birds chirped and how
they might have sounded serene. But the cage around them and the Urban
Mess beyond has told me that they can be your Muse for _____ pesos only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the month of Jan 2024, these are the albums I listened to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Album Name&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Artist&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Nobela&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Join the Club&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Computer World&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Kraftwerk&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Kala&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;M.I.A.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen to &lt;em&gt;Nobela&lt;/em&gt; if: You like your OPM flavored with 2005 alternative
rock that&amp;rsquo;s semi-obscured by the fame of its contemporaries. Underdogs
like Join the Club had been a fave among angsty teenager of that era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen to &lt;em&gt;Computer World&lt;/em&gt; if: You are almost always breaking out into a
dance number each time you hear an EDM from the 80s, but can&amp;rsquo;t because
you now have aging bones. You swear that their great
track, &lt;em&gt;Computer Love&lt;/em&gt;, might have been the trigger to wake the sleeper
agent in you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen to &lt;em&gt;Kala&lt;/em&gt; if: The electronica fuses into hiphop to make that
familiar buzz, and you&amp;rsquo;re not bothered by it. Why would you be? It
sounds catchy and doesn&amp;rsquo;t choke on typical machismo.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited PDF in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/cv&#34;&gt;CV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited some lines in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/site&#34;&gt;Site&lt;/a&gt;. More specifically, this site now
contains&amp;mdash;&lt;em&gt;drumroll&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;JavaScript to render some maths. For example, this is the standard form of quadratic equation: \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;math-typesetting&#34;&gt;Math Typesetting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just this week, I was looking for ways to incorporate math typesetting
in this blog, and the result of that search are the following links,
shared here for those who are interested:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mathscribe.com/author/jqmath.html&#34;&gt;jqmath&lt;/a&gt; is a JavaScript
module that &amp;ldquo;makes it easy to put formatted mathematical expressions
in web pages.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://katex.org/&#34;&gt;katex&lt;/a&gt; is a fast math typesetting library, poised
to be an alternative to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mathjax.org/&#34;&gt;MathJax&lt;/a&gt;, another popular math typesetting JS.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sixthform.info/katex/guide.html&#34;&gt;simple guide to using katex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://asciimath.org/&#34;&gt;AsciiMath&lt;/a&gt; is another &amp;ldquo;easy-to-write&amp;rdquo; markup
language for mathematics. But if I&amp;rsquo;m understanding the current
documentation correctly, it works only in Firefox and Safari as of
writing this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thomas Lochmatter maintains this &lt;a href=&#34;https://viereck.ch/latex-to-svg/index.html&#34;&gt;LaTeX to SVG&lt;/a&gt; web app for converting math LaTeX equation to a SVG&amp;mdash;useful for sharing image-based math formulas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may not need these at all due to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.122.0&#34;&gt;recent updates on Hugo v0.122.0&lt;/a&gt;,
which highlights LaTeX typesetting directly from Markdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A possible alternative I might explore in the future is to implement Joe
Mooring&amp;rsquo;s way of converting math expressions to SVG as discussed in his
article &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.veriphor.com/articles/mathematical-expressions/&#34;&gt;Mathematical expressions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;done-with-applied-cryptography-specialization&#34;&gt;Done with &lt;em&gt;Applied Cryptography Specialization&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a month ago, I publicly announced that I was
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/148/#dipping-toes-in-crypto&#34;&gt;dipping toes in cryptography&lt;/a&gt; as a form
of accountability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After weeks of on-and-off self-studying, I&amp;rsquo;m glad to share that I have
now completed the program, and with it, a new certification:
&lt;strong&gt;Introduction to Applied Cryptography Specialization from University of
Colorado System&lt;/strong&gt;! Click here to view &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/VDBCUULAG5FR&#34;&gt;my credential via Coursera&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the instructors of the program, William Bahn, Richard White,
and Sang-Yoon Chang for making this Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;parking-issue-in-our-neighborhood&#34;&gt;Parking issue in our neighborhood&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recently attended a meeting with the homeowners&amp;rsquo; association, and the
agenda was about parking slots. In a middle-class neighborhood where
residents have disposable income to avail their own car but not their
own garage, the common street that we all share quickly clogs up with
death machines. The heat escalates when people think they own the
parking slot in front of their house, but other car owners use it
because, they would argue, &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s public property.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting attempted to address this issue. Without an experienced
facilitator, though, the [non?]discussion took longer than expected. Others
walked out; many, including us, stayed, hoping to have a resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After hours of meandering talk, the resolution is a &lt;em&gt;nuanced&lt;/em&gt; status
quo, but status quo nonetheless. Yes, you read that right. I won&amp;rsquo;t
bother you with more boring details, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all the animated discussion, the topic of pedestrian welfare and how
they&amp;mdash;we&amp;mdash;are affected by this parking issue was not brought up. The
streets are not &amp;ldquo;meant for cars alone&amp;rdquo; contrary to what many people
believe. It is a public space shared by all, and pedestrians shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have
to jaywalk in and around vehicles, stationary or otherwise, in stupidly
dangerous 30-kph residential streets, to get to their destinations safely.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Miracle of Night Walk</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/160/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2024 12:46:39 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/160/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Night walk with &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/feb2022-photos/#day-17&#34;&gt;the dog&lt;/a&gt;, after spending the
whole daytime glued to the work computer, heals all organs battered by
the Grind. The cool evening provides a nice ambience while the
almost-full moon watches over its constituents. Earlier, on my way home
from office, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but &amp;ldquo;dedicate&amp;rdquo; the same moon to my partner
when I saw it glowing in the sky. It is but a harmless romantic gesture&amp;mdash;the
celestial object belongs to no one and thus cannot be served from one
lover to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My companion and I are like the Earth and Moon, always tugging at each
other as the larger of the two guides its partner along a predetermined
path. I should be a responsible human to this dog by teaching it how to
behave properly during walks, e.g., to remain calm, and to walk along or
behind me. And to that, I say what I say to Death: Next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our usual route, we come across a night jogger twice whom, on
both occasions, we witness zig-zagging. Are they increasing their number
of steps without changing their usual route?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, the miracle is not in the nigh-absence of motorists, but in the
possibility of attaining this Quiet amid the urban mess of ______ City.
When it&amp;rsquo;s like this, don&amp;rsquo;t make me hate it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Copypasta on FB and its significance</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/159/</link>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added new page about &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/testi&#34;&gt;what people have been saying about me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added an image to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/bujo&#34;&gt;Bujo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/about&#34;&gt;About&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/disclaimer&#34;&gt;disclaimer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited sections in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/site&#34;&gt;Colophon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;thinking-about-food-prep-lately&#34;&gt;Thinking about food prep lately&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Busyness of daily life, sadly, has the potential to chip away at
the soul, because the Grind is designed to be that way. It&amp;rsquo;s becoming normal to
have no energy left to prepare my own meal. So whenever possible, I ask
for help from loved ones to do it for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point, I imagined hiring my own personal chef in the future if I
could finally afford one. I&amp;rsquo;m still thinking about it, because I don&amp;rsquo;t always
dream of outsourcing my creative outlet to other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t mind waking up to a decent breakfast from time to time, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;circulating-fb-copypasta&#34;&gt;Circulating FB copypasta&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite my not being&amp;mdash;practically&amp;mdash;on the platform, I was notified of
a copypasta regarding Facebook (FB) and how users should do something about
their data. To my knowledge, the following is the whole copypasta text,
lightly edited to add proper punctuation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was even on TV.
Mine really turned blue. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget that tomorrow starts the new
Facebook rule (aka&amp;hellip; new name, META) where they can use your photos.
Don&amp;rsquo;t forget the deadline is today!!! I do not authorize Facebook or
any entity associated with Facebook to use my photos, information,
messages or posts, past or future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this statement, I notify Facebook that it is strictly prohibited
to disclose, copy, distribute, or take any other action against me
based on this profile and/or its contents. Viiolation of privacy may
be punishable by law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please abide by the law META/FaceBook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how to do it:
Hold your finger anywhere in this message and &amp;ldquo;copy&amp;rdquo; will
appear. Click &amp;ldquo;copy&amp;rdquo;. Then go to your page, create a new post
and place your finger anywhere in the empty field. &amp;ldquo;Paste&amp;rdquo;
will appear and click Paste. This will bypass the system&amp;hellip;.
He who does nothing consents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circulating this text on Facebook does nothing with regards to
increasing one&amp;rsquo;s privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/&#34;&gt;Facebook&amp;rsquo;s Terms of Service (ToS)&lt;/a&gt;,
under &amp;ldquo;How our services are funded,&amp;rdquo; they state, as of writing this
(emphasis mine):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of paying to use Facebook and the other products and services
we offer, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;by using the Meta Products covered by these Terms, you agree&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
that we can show you personalized ads and other commercial and
sponsored content that businesses and organizations pay us to promote
on and off Meta Company Products. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We use your personal data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, such as
information about your activity and interests, to show you
personalized ads and sponsored content that may be more relevant to
you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t read the entire ToS, but given the platform&amp;rsquo;s notorious
history when it comes to exploiting users&amp;rsquo; data, I&amp;rsquo;m almost sure that
hidden beneath the legalese and marketing terms, using their platform
means giving them all sorts of permission to use whatever FB has on you
in whatever ways they could think of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there&amp;rsquo;s any good in circulating the copypasta, it is in making more
people aware of their interactions in and &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; the platform, and how they should
think twice before inputting their data to be fed to the algorithm for
FB&amp;rsquo;s profit. Albeit ignorant, this is one way to build trust in digital
communities. Yet, at the same time, fact-checking a piece of information
first prevents circulating fear, uncertainty, and doubt
(&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty,_and_doubt&#34;&gt;FUD&lt;/a&gt;),
which in my opinion, is a better tactic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for capitalists:
Just because people are not savvy enough, in terms of technical and/or
ethical know-how, when navigating digital spaces
doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean Big Tech companies should capitalize on them.
We all deserve talking to each other without having to worry whether our
data would end up somewhere we don&amp;rsquo;t like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;celebrities-privacy&#34;&gt;Celebrities&amp;rsquo; Privacy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still on the topic, I wonder if it&amp;rsquo;s worth receiving
money and/or recognition for diminished privacy. Celebrities have to face
this dilemma (I think?) on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe, reaching a level of fame short-circuits a
corresponding part of consciousness that determines one&amp;rsquo;s knack to be
more performative, to transform a facet that&amp;rsquo;s public-ready.
It&amp;rsquo;s not necessarily a bad thing;
we need subject matter experts to share ideas to the masses,
and internet scales this exponentially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And scale it does&amp;mdash;with the advent of social media on the internet,
more people care more about performing for an unseen audience for
whatever reason than preserving a private life.
And again, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean it&amp;rsquo;s bad.
But when does it become so?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Waking up in an urban space in January</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/158/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 14 Jan 2024 01:48:19 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/158/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tweaked some minor CSS details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, we have cold January mornings again. Too, we have that lull
at dawn when all is peaceful. Sleep gestures.
But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t last for long. Cars and
motors come to existence in gradual crescendo on the adjacent busy
street, busing people to places. I hear the occasional bell of a
cyclist, and I imagine them weaving between cars. And if the cyclist
were your typical commuter, &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; would be on a beater bike, politely
shredding his way to work whilst death-evading impatient big machines on
four wheels. This is the morning din I don&amp;rsquo;t like. Where are the birds?
Have they been fully displaced?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I open my eyes and get up. There, on the floor! A bird. Supposedly a
&amp;ldquo;gift,&amp;rdquo; it will always be lifeless now, no thanks to one of our cats&#39;
knack for hunting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of mornings, one workmate complained that their mornings as of
late have always been &amp;ldquo;hot.&amp;rdquo; They didn&amp;rsquo;t elaborate on it, but it made me
wonder. I suspect that it could be because they&amp;rsquo;re surrounded with
concrete, which absorbs and traps warmth from the sun. And everywhere we
look, concrete makes up a lot of our buildings, sidewalks, and parking
lots which prevents heat from being released into the cold night sky.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Thinking about convenience</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/157/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Jan 2024 00:23:51 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/157/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added new page: &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/tools&#34;&gt;Tools I Regularly Use&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/foss&#34;&gt;FOSS&lt;/a&gt; page to lay out the default apps I use
regularly. Also moved it out of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/project&#34;&gt;Projects&lt;/a&gt; list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/support&#34;&gt;Support&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removed an item from &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/di-why&#34;&gt;DI-Why&lt;/a&gt; list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And other minor CSS updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally got to hang out with friends this weekend, and one of them
gifted a book to me, brushing off my insistence to pay for it. The book
is &lt;em&gt;Repair Revolution&lt;/em&gt; by John Wackman and Elizabeth Knight, and while
this post isn&amp;rsquo;t a full review of it as I&amp;rsquo;ve just started skimming the
first few pages, I read a line there that says something about how
convenience affects our want to repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think more generally, when a form of convenience is introduced to a
system, it is gradually integrated, and people who may have benefitted
at least once from it will now take it into consideration in their
succeeding actions. It&amp;rsquo;s not necessarily a bad thing, unless maybe the
loop evolves into a newer version that it becomes a bit less sustainable
because of the convenience component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real life examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many people, especially if they can afford it, would prefer to own a
car than a bike to get around. As policies continue to engineer our
urban cities to be more car-centric, it would only make choosing
riding a bike harder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The accessibility of mainstream social media platforms like Facebook
allows its users to connect with one another instantly wherever they
are, as long as they&amp;rsquo;re connected to the internet. Naturally due to
network effect, people seem to expect everyone to have an account.
Some workplaces even leverage this expectation so that they push all
work-related communication&amp;mdash;that is, without paying for other
services like, Microsoft Teams&amp;mdash;to, say, Facebook Messenger. I
wonder if opting out of these services is a form of privilege, a way
of regaining digital silence that only the elite can get.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m no futurist, so I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how communities would react as we
discover new ways of making our lives more convenient (at the expense of
&lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;?), because my view of the future is limited to the radius of
my arm&amp;rsquo;s length. Beyond that, the image breaks down to infinite
fractals. A few parts look happy and serene, but all of it is shrouded
in uncertainty. Just the other morning, who would&amp;rsquo;ve thought I
would wake up dizzy after sleeping longer than my usual number of hours?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel out of shape. Aside from the general uncertainties, I have a
non-medical hunch it&amp;rsquo;s because of all the endocrine disruptors
we&amp;rsquo;re releasing out there as convenience fee.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GOMBURZA (2023)</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/156/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 03 Jan 2024 07:32:03 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/156/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added &lt;a href=&#34;https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/openring&#34;&gt;openring&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/log&#34;&gt;Log&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/site&#34;&gt;colophon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;em&gt;GOMBURZA&lt;/em&gt; (2023), Director Pepe Diokno offers the viewers a
historical drama based on true events led to the martyrdom of the three
priests, Gomes, Burgos, and Zamora.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film is decidedly dark&amp;mdash;literally, with many evening scenes
seemingly lit only by candle flames; and figuratively, with how the
three priests were sentenced to death by garrote, a death no one should
have to go through ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with many countries&amp;rsquo; histories, the one presented in the film is
death-filled, from prologue to epilogue. Colonizers do love their
massacres, and people in power have no qualms killing to instill fear to
control and subjugate their colonies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luck, too, seems to play a role in nation-shaping.
And I hesitate to use the term &lt;em&gt;-building&lt;/em&gt; as I&amp;rsquo;m not sure
if we have ever gotten around that. More specifically, bad luck
has consistently hounded the Philippines, something the film attempts to
explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a moment it got me thinking: if by bad luck I would die at this
moment, is there something nontrivial that I&amp;rsquo;m leaving as a gift to the
world? Maybe this blog?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also worth noting is the actor Enchong Dee who, despite
his short screen time, gave a terrific performance. His character,
Father Gomes, was implicated by something he said that&amp;rsquo;s taken out of
context that. Dee did deliver the range of emotions Gomes must have felt
throughout the whole ordeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, two more things I have observed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A nameless &lt;em&gt;indio&lt;/em&gt; (i.e. native) is sometimes shown, not fully
participating, but is there, listening and reacting to himself. Most
of us, I think, will relate to this character in that, history will
deem us unimportant because we won&amp;rsquo;t have grand actions nor heroic
deaths that might alter the trajectory of our future. But our stories
will matter. When we finally decide to do something, it &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; have a
bearing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ferdinand Marcos Jr., son of the late dictator, of the family
desparate to revise their history, gives a speech about supporting
local film industry before the film starts, an occurence in all MMFF
entries. His presence is juxtaposed with the film being a historical
drama that&amp;rsquo;s thoroughly researched and fact checked by historians
including Ambeth Ocampo and Xiao Chua.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Destroy Every Identifier</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/154/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 30 Dec 2023 10:53:05 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/154/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My feelings toward December are usually &lt;em&gt;meh&lt;/em&gt;, and this year, it&amp;rsquo;s still
true. Thoughts when I was much younger are surfacing, and the world
around me checks their integrity. &amp;ldquo;Are these ideas still naive?&amp;rdquo; seems
to be the central theme that binds all the significant events this
month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-bandwidths-for-projects&#34;&gt;On bandwidths for projects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I work on a &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/project&#34;&gt;project&lt;/a&gt;, I look at my mental bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of my projects are in limbo because I may be in eternal
lethargy, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori/#entry--154&#34;&gt;something&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori/#entry--292&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori/#entry--378&#34;&gt;written&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/20&#34;&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; in the past. But there will come a time when I look at my to-do
list, and an item will stand out for no good reason other than
I just feel like doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t go well always, though. Failure isn&amp;rsquo;t always conducive to a
learning experience, sometimes leaving the project worse off than when I
started. At this point, it would have to be shelved until further
notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;recent-wedding&#34;&gt;Recent Wedding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, we were invited to our relative&amp;rsquo;s wedding. Before that,
they have been living together for almost four decades,
their three children witnesses to their ups and downs.
The couple say they&amp;rsquo;re still in love, which is always a
welcoming news in a world of full of hate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My subconscious reacts to this by sending me a dream about ethical
non-monogamy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;quote-of-the-day&#34;&gt;Quote of the day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there&amp;rsquo;s nothing left to do, &lt;a href=&#34;https://realhumanbaby.tumblr.com/post/691974027004231680/what-should-i-do&#34;&gt;destroy everything you identify with&lt;/a&gt;,
then identify with something that you cannot destroy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, then, I am the void with a definite body yet enduring the biggest awe that is Nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the month of Dec 2023, these are the albums I listened to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Album Name&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Artist&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Mirage&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Glass Beams&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Sundowning&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Sleep Token&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both bands have unusual aesthetics involving covering up the
face: Glass Beams, an instrumental funk group that sounds like Khruangbin, use
crystal beads; and Sleep Token, a metal rock band, use eerie masks and
anonymity. Their sounds could not be more different that one another,
both of which appeal to me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mallari (2023)</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/153/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 27 Dec 2023 01:51:34 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/153/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Metro Manila Film Festival is, once again, releasing good films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mallari&lt;/em&gt; (2023) is a horror-thriller headlined by Piolo Pascual.
It is about three generation of Mallaris linked together by generational
&amp;ldquo;darkness&amp;rdquo; (is how I would put it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the film could have been better if the jump scares were
reduced to a max of one. In fact, every horror and horror-adjacent movie
should only be allowed a budget of one jump scare, non-transferable.
When overused, jump scare cheapens the thrill. It scars the oeuvre
rather than augment it. It leaps because it is impatient to creep into
the delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the themes used in the film remind me of Edgar Allan
Poe&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Tell-Tale Heart&lt;/em&gt;. At least two of the main characters turn
out to be unreliable with their points of views as each of them justify
their descent to madness. If a force greater than us compels us to act
on things not grounded on reality, is this a curse?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bane of human fallibility is to throw away our principles and beliefs
for more selfish reasons disguised as an act of Love. We go out
committing infinities through all dimensions for our soulmates, but how
sure are we that it is Love that we offer and not a rotten form of
it? We can&amp;rsquo;t know for sure until it&amp;rsquo;s too late.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Past Lives (2023)</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/152/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 26 Dec 2023 01:04:07 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/152/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently watched &lt;em&gt;Past Lives&lt;/em&gt; (2023), written and directed by Celine
Song. It got me thinking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of &lt;em&gt;inyeon&lt;/em&gt; (인연), of past lives lived and relived, of
attempting to make sense of the web of what-ifs annotating the
storylines that intersected at least once, of minding the gap between
two childhood sweethearts&amp;mdash;is a familiar feeling I once felt when, like
in the movie, a childhood crush immigrated to Canada for better life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would have nursed that budding puppy love, but I grew up shy, thanks
to having odd formative years being mentally and emotionally distant
from the ones with whom I was supposed to be close with. In reality,
there&amp;rsquo;s no point in holding on to that nostalgia. It would have died on
its own, not because it was neglected, but because around it, more
beautiful things continue to grow and flourish. The husk of this puppy
love would fertilize the ground of other future romance. And that is
all there was to it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Holidaze Dispatch 2023</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/151/</link>

      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/151/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/cv&#34;&gt;CV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added a book I just read, by Patricia Evangelista, to the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/books&#34;&gt;books&lt;/a&gt; list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;brief-review-of-some-people-need-killing&#34;&gt;Brief Review of &lt;em&gt;Some People Need Killing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have waived my distaste for hard-bound books to finish this
book.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Like
the stories here, I say that without exaggeration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously, though, I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of the Patricia Evangelista&amp;rsquo;s concise
prose: true to journalism, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t get in the way of telling the
stories of victims of Duterte&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/drugwar&#34;&gt;war on drugs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It presents different perspectives, including some of the author&amp;rsquo;s (who
covered the drug war for six years for a local publication), that
converge into a seemingly obvious conclusion: that the war on drugs, at
its core, is a tool used conveniently by a select few to further their
agenda, at the expense of thousands of lives. In reality, though, the
conclusion may not be so obvious to a lot of us. Many would still
idolize a strongman, disregarding fully his fascistic tendencies, hoping
he can bring about the needed change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I found the book heavy. It took me a while to finish it
because I could only at most read one chapter at a time without being
engulfed in burning rage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-does-it-feel-like-to-be-consumed-by-hate&#34;&gt;What does it feel like to be consumed by hate?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the supposed spacetime that is the Christmas season in the Philippine
archipelago, feelings adjacent to love abound. Some heal, some destroy.
It would&amp;rsquo;ve been great (read: grim) if there&amp;rsquo;s an ultimatum that forces
everyone to feel the same festive feeling&amp;mdash;to create happiness or some
other jovial miracle out of thin air&amp;mdash;but we&amp;rsquo;re humans, much more
capable than that simple force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of them, on its wheel of color, is hate. And I posit a deep
thought related to the question, but it disappears. In its place are
more questions in need of deeper answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should I ask the territorial mammals in the neighborhood, all of them
trapped together in the urban hellscape of Metro Manila?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should I ask the vengeful spirits that always scheme for a violent
ending to their enemies&amp;rsquo; sleep?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When one rewards hate with more of it, it grows like sarcoma when fed
with sugar, so the pop science says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;flu&#34;&gt;FLU&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This household has been nursing various types of weather-related
illnesses this past few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are getting better, and hopefully, nothing disastrous damages our
already limited brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;christmas-dinners-with-friends&#34;&gt;Christmas Dinners with friends&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hosted two different dinners with two different sets of friends this week.
Each was a different kind of chill, each filled with storytelling and
laughter, an invigorating experience that counters the effects of the holidaze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For self-proclaimed purveyors of the non-traditional,
it&amp;rsquo;s oddly good that we embraced the tradition of
Christmas with non-traditional Christmas food, including pizzas, donuts,
lasagna, fruit platters, Mexican-inspired beans, seafood &lt;em&gt;swam&lt;/em&gt;, and
coffee. Nowhere were spaghetti, pancit, hotdogs, fruit salads, hams,
roasted chickens, and other usual attacks to &lt;em&gt;corazón&lt;/em&gt;. We are &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/146/#on-being-cool&#34;&gt;anti-cool&lt;/a&gt;
like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could be said that hard-bound books last longer. But
do they really? I&amp;rsquo;m starting to think that it&amp;rsquo;s just a marketing strat for
publishers to overprice such books. Also, I don&amp;rsquo;t get book
(dust) &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_jacket&#34;&gt;jackets&lt;/a&gt;: they flippin&amp;rsquo; flap around, so much that it annoys me. It&amp;rsquo;s
already 2023: don&amp;rsquo;t we already have the technology to integrate the book design
on the hard cover itself?&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/blogroll&#34;&gt;blogroll&lt;/a&gt; with more description.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-existential-dread&#34;&gt;On existential dread&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, my mind goes to places that can only be classified as
existentially dreadful, and not knowing the reason why adds to the
despair that I can&amp;rsquo;t help but feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has manifested in at least one dream (nightmare, tbh):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found myself in a city center with tall buildings. One or two of the
buildings nearby started groaning, and when I looked up, it began
collapsing. As the buildings crumbled around me one by one, I started to
run. But we all know, like oil and water, running and dreams don&amp;rsquo;t mix
well. I was going nowhere, no matter how &amp;ldquo;fast&amp;rdquo; I moved my legs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s as if a cosmic entity has pinned me with its tendrils into my
proper place. I will oblige, I think, but first I must snap out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to wake up, I discovered that it must be a conscious
effort: something from within must have been stirred, and
one must have been brave enough to stare into the abyss long enough to
recognize its outer shape, to make something out of it, to do something
about it. It&amp;rsquo;s a very long process, one that involves uneasiness and
jogging in place in sandy Plutonian shores.
I was successful once, when I quit smoking many years ago.
Sometimes, coming around is a collective effort, with loved and trusted ones.
Wait, are we still talking about my dream?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-have-reached-my-buffet-quota&#34;&gt;I have reached my buffet quota&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christmas &amp;ldquo;parties&amp;rdquo; are everywhere at this time of the year. One of the
cost-effective ways to celebrate them, according to some employers, is to
have a buffet in known diners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past week alone, I&amp;rsquo;ve been in two buffets, both of which were
sponsored by my employer, spaced only three days
apart. Another one is being brewed this week, to which I politely
declined, quipping that the last time I burped, I tasted cholesterol at
the back of my throat. The joke garnered two laugh reacts from my
colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffets in the Philippines are known to be eat-all-you-can, a
bastardization really of waste-what-you-can&amp;rsquo;t. Of course, this is not
unique to Filipinos; many people elsewhere throwaway perfectly edible
food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And diners will
inevitably waste food despite the numerous signage that discourage them
with a hefty fine. &amp;ldquo;No leftovers allowed&amp;rdquo; is often juxtaposed with
plates of meat and carbs and sauce that no longer have a space in
anyone&amp;rsquo;s stomach, each a victim of &lt;em&gt;takaw tingin&lt;/em&gt;, a local idiom to roughly
mean &amp;ldquo;food greed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have cleaned my plates, emptied my drinks, had my fill.
I&amp;rsquo;m done with that. At least, for now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On Reading Self, Texts, and People</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/149/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Dec 2023 08:08:49 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/149/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/books&#34;&gt;a book&lt;/a&gt; I recently finished on the list. Brief review
below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trimmed the HTML version of &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/cv&#34;&gt;CV&lt;/a&gt; to its core. One can still see
the details of my professional background in the linked PDF there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;brief-review-of-the-philippines-is-not-a-small-country&#34;&gt;Brief Review of &lt;em&gt;The Philippines Is Not a Small Country&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a book of essays by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gideonlasco.com/&#34;&gt;Gideon Lasco&lt;/a&gt;, a medical anthropologist,
in which he discusses various issues and topics that are connected in
some way to the Philippine archipelago and its flora and fauna. Subjects
include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Country&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Culture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tech&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modernity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;World&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He writes concisely enough to deliver his main points, which I think he&amp;rsquo;s
compelled to do, because most, if not all, of these articles had appeared on local
newspaper/s. The brevity is boon in that it easily captures the
willingness of the reader to participate in this discussion, but also a
bane in that the author could not explore the how&amp;rsquo;s and why&amp;rsquo;s of the
calls to action he imparts on nearly every write-up. So, when he
implores the reader, to me it feels cheesy, and in the end,
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I&amp;rsquo;m going to act on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 90+ articles, I only really love about one-fifth of them.
And I don&amp;rsquo;t mean that as an insult or anything negative.
Your experience may vary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final verdict: a good observation of Filipino lives everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-text-heavy-rss-feeds&#34;&gt;On text-heavy RSS feeds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m subscribed to about 200 sites&amp;mdash;mix of digital gardens, wikis,
personal blogs, and everything in between&amp;mdash;on my RSS feed reader, &lt;a href=&#34;https://newsboat.org/&#34;&gt;newsboat&lt;/a&gt;.
Newsboat focuses on text which, for many who choose newsboat, is a
feature and not a bug. Text scales well, and is relatively snappy, no
matter how long a piece is. Since newsboat is extensible, there are
different hacks to view an image, ranging from simple to complex, but
I won&amp;rsquo;t be discussing them here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m interested in how RSS feed readers like newsboat bypass the site design
from which they pull their contents, and dump them on their own format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I&amp;rsquo;m torn by this perk. I grew up in a &amp;ldquo;colorful&amp;rdquo;
internet of popping site designs and classy typography. By reading blogs in
command line, I&amp;rsquo;m stripping both the distraction and the allure of the
creative process that the authors may have incorporated in their posts.
Sometimes, this is good; sometimes, it gets boring, so much so that I
find myself opening the blog-post on the browser (newsboat allows this
with a press of a button) just to feel some colors in my corneas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-logical-people&#34;&gt;On &amp;ldquo;logical&amp;rdquo; people&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder about these kinds of people who self-claim as logical.
When they pursue the purest forms of Logic and Reason, do they actually
approach it, or are they led further away from it by their own growing ego?
As an observer, I find it interesting to note the disconnect between
these &amp;ldquo;logical&amp;rdquo; people&amp;rsquo;s words vs their actions; and yet, it&amp;rsquo;s tricky to
navigate along the relationships they distort around them by
&amp;ldquo;following logic&amp;rdquo; when in reality, they&amp;rsquo;re just suppressing their
emotions&amp;mdash;not a good thing for anyone, especially arrogant men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-earthquakes&#34;&gt;On earthquakes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lumindol&lt;/em&gt; last 5 Dec, and I only felt the last second of it, which
registered on my body as one of our cats bumping playfully on to my work
chair. When I looked down, there was no sign of cat. Only when I looked back up
to my computer did it dawn on me, thanks to the work chats flooding my MS
Teams, that it was an earthquake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I&amp;rsquo;m oblivious to such magnitude while many people became dizzy after
experiencing the whole ordeal, oblivion then might claim me in my sleep,
crushed beneath the rubble. This is not an exaggeration, because I do have a history of
sleeping through earthquakes, and my housemates at those times had had
to wake me up.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What the secret to work is</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/148/</link>

      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/148/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added links to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/books&#34;&gt;books&lt;/a&gt; I have reviewed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added new book&amp;mdash;manga, really&amp;mdash;to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/books&#34;&gt;Books&lt;/a&gt; list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited some lines in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/foss&#34;&gt;FOSS&lt;/a&gt; for clarity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rewrote some sections in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/bujo&#34;&gt;Bujo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;November is near the tail-end of the year that follows the
Gregorian calendar. This post is about the tail-end of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dipping-toes-in-crypto&#34;&gt;Dipping toes in crypto&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-graphy, that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/145/#on-thinking-of-pursuing-grad-school&#34;&gt;After mulling about it for a while&lt;/a&gt;,
I decided to take a short program in &amp;ldquo;Applied Cryptography Specialization&amp;rdquo;.
Whether something good will come out of it lies on my persistence to
keep showing up, even if I don&amp;rsquo;t feel like it.
Realistically speaking, it might not be enough of a jumpstart for a
&amp;ldquo;better&amp;rdquo; career path,
but the future is bleak,
and the course to it, while direct, is enciphered in chaos until we make
sense of what&amp;rsquo;s here and now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I&amp;rsquo;m at the discrete maths part, and it is interesting for me,
despite my limited knowledge of it.
I like how maths has broad enough of a scope that it&amp;rsquo;s in the art of
secret communication as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I&amp;rsquo;m re-subscribing to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.schneier.com&#34;&gt;Bruce Schneier&amp;rsquo;s Blog&lt;/a&gt; to start gaining more relevant knowledge on this matter. If you, dear reader, would like to suggest some cryptography- and/or cybersecurity-related blogs, please send them my way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-pessimism&#34;&gt;On Pessimism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give people a less-than-decent quality of living,
and a lot of them are bound to have a negative outlook on the upcoming
days. Consider also that many people have the tendency to be pessimist,
because honestly, it&amp;rsquo;s easier. At least it was for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try not to go back to that mood, because I&amp;rsquo;m not a
healthy pessimist. &amp;ldquo;It takes strength to be gentle and kind,&amp;rdquo;
according to &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/M6o1SEj02t0?si=utz9uLn5XkR1R-y2&#34;&gt;The Smiths&amp;rsquo;s song&lt;/a&gt;,
perhaps implying that a more positive mindset
is more helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rarely take on challenges, but this one&amp;mdash;of
courage and goodness&amp;mdash;yields to a net
positive outcome for me and for everyone around me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;brief-review-of-the-man-without-talent&#34;&gt;Brief Review of &lt;em&gt;The Man Without Talent&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manga by Yoshiharu Tsuge navigates a rocky situation of an artist&amp;rsquo;s
recent choices and how he, even as the main provider of
his family, seemingly prefers odd jobs over &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; work.
What even is &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; work if not dedicating hours of one&amp;rsquo;s life to
something bigger, whether they like it or not?
If this is work, it may make some people not want to participate in its
systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of layers to peel off from this seemingly simple story.
One would be forgiven if they should hiss at the protagonist&amp;rsquo;s
(in)actions, especially if his family&amp;rsquo;s welfare is at stake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My palm constantly cups my face in disappointment in the artist&amp;rsquo;s behavior.
But this is because, I think, the story is criticizing Japan&amp;rsquo;s highly
patriarchal society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the month of Nov 2023, these are the albums I listened to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Album Name&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Artist&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Is This It&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;The Strokes&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Body Talk&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Robyn&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Chewing Cotton Wool&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;The Japanese House&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like Robyn&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Body Talk&lt;/em&gt; as I feel it being an antithesis to modern
life&amp;rsquo;s boredom and loneliness, even though some of the lyrics can be
about those. The most iconic song, &lt;em&gt;Dancing On My Own&lt;/em&gt;, is an upbeat
heart-wrenching synth-pop that, according to a friend, is the femme
equivalent of The Killers&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Mr. Brightside&lt;/em&gt;. In terms of overall sound
and effect, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to disagree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;spotify-wrapped-2023&#34;&gt;Spotify Wrapped 2023&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;rsquo;m in Spotify&amp;rsquo;s surveillance and it in
my system, I might well share my top artists of the year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tennis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Japanese Breakfast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Smiths&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SB19&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arctic Monkeys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this list probably tells about me, according to me:
I&amp;rsquo;m ready to embrace changes, especially if there&amp;rsquo;s a strong evidence
that it would eventually lead to a
feel-good state. But nostalgia anchors me to a comfort zone that feels
several times better than new, exciting shifts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Looking down on Mobility</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/147/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Nov 2023 02:12:43 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/147/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added one book to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/books&#34;&gt;Book list&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minor edit in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/site&#34;&gt;Site&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people have now observed that technology evolves quickly
that ethics can&amp;rsquo;t keep up. We don&amp;rsquo;t know yet what the
implications of a shiny new thing are until it blows up, literally
and/or figuratively, and still we go on using them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another striking view is that even if the ethics does keep
up, no tech is completely fool-proof.
&amp;ldquo;The universe is always making better fools,&amp;rdquo; says one person on the
internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with the rise of mobile phones comes new quirks that are not only becoming
normal, but to my untrained-in-socio eyes are also getting vogue.
One of which is something that annoys me: people looking down on
their phones &lt;em&gt;while&lt;/em&gt; walking. This bothers me verily because the
perpetrator, among many other things, expects other people to adjust
around them, as if to (unintentionally?) signal, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t care.&amp;rdquo;
My rant/question ends with: &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/146/#on-being-cool&#34;&gt;Is this the Cool thing?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing new about this. There are pictures &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; videos
online of people reading newspapers and books while walking.
The handheld thing that has our attention may be different,
but the effect, I would argue, is the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow, though, the latter is where my logic circuit shorts.
I would rather see people colliding with one another because they were
reading books rather than being on their smartphones.
I recently saw a young guy treading towards me, their eyes partly fixed
on their book at hand, before dodging me as soon as they sensed my
closing in on them.
My partner, who was with me at the time, remarked, &amp;ldquo;That
person is one of my people!&amp;rdquo;
They&amp;rsquo;re mine, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, we need to be mindful of how move in the public.
Multi-tasking is a myth.
Just as it&amp;rsquo;s not recommended to text and drive,
it&amp;rsquo;s not safe to walk and have your focus elsewhere.
For better or worse, we&amp;rsquo;re always surrounded by mystery:
of people coming and going in waves,
of objects and non-objects popping in and out of our periphery,
of time that forces us Forward.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Musicals are cool; I&#39;m not...alone</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/146/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 Nov 2023 01:09:44 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/146/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The concept of time and entropy is still too complex for me to fully
understand. Yes, I have a general idea of what each of them mean, and
how I can sometimes use them to my advantage in my daily life. At the
end of the day, though, I&amp;rsquo;m only consistent at two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March another day towards oblivion (easy)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update this blog weekly (nigh improbable)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mamamatay ka rin&lt;/em&gt;, so says the adage.
It&amp;rsquo;s crystal clear to me to not mind the things out of my reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-data-collection&#34;&gt;On Data Collection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m in an odd position where I&amp;rsquo;m able to collect many kinds
of data relatively easily, whether for personal or work use.
And I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking how many of this effort is for &amp;ldquo;just-in-case&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all the data I collect is overwhelming me such that I&amp;rsquo;m left
paralyzed, then what use are they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One strategy I do is
I try to be mindful of the information I curate into my offline wiki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we scale up beyond the personal, we have big tech companies mining our data
without our knowledge. Deceptive design patterns on the tools&amp;mdash;both hard-
and software&amp;mdash;we use keep our focus away from the what matters most
when interfacing with these companies&amp;rsquo; products and services: our
informed consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;brief-review-of-hamilton-musical&#34;&gt;Brief review of &lt;em&gt;Hamilton&lt;/em&gt; Musical&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m lucky to have watched the musical recently. Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve
experienced it myself, I get its appeal. Overall, I&amp;rsquo;d say it&amp;rsquo;s a good
watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hamilton&lt;/em&gt; has its ups and downs, no doubt.
While I&amp;rsquo;m starting to appreciate the effort of all people on and
offstage producing these kinds of musicals,
I may not be there yet fully, if that makes sense.
My eyes and ears were most of the time
overwhelmed with the sounds and colors and motions.
Someone tell me if the point is to not focus on one thing,
but to just let it all take you along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The songs are good and catchy, many of them rapped.
My favorite one is &amp;ldquo;Satisfied&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had to nitpick, my main gripe is in the content itself:
the biography of Alexander Hamilton. Not a fan.
Of America&amp;rsquo;s history, of learning more about its founding fathers.
One character I like, though, is Lafayette.
But to &lt;em&gt;Hamilton&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s credit, it was all presented to me
in a very entertaining way, enough to keep me engaged whether I like the
content or not.
Like watching a forest fire, maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-being-cool&#34;&gt;On being cool&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cool people don&amp;rsquo;t go around telling people that they&amp;rsquo;re cool.
They just are. People around them notice that and make that inference
for themselves, and agree &amp;ldquo;This person is cool.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anti-cool people (probably me) &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; tell people that they&amp;rsquo;re anti-cool.
And that&amp;rsquo;s that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-being-alone-in-the-house&#34;&gt;On being alone in the house&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, my lonesome bothers me little,
only so far as to who will take out the trash.
The answer to that &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; surprise&amp;mdash;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Days ago, home was entangled with familial ties.
Now, I&amp;rsquo;m the only human left to look after our furry friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I can&amp;rsquo;t say I miss it,
but solitude forces me to be more creative at keeping myself
and the spaces around me lively enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Days bleed into the next one.
Tracking time means I know that soon I won&amp;rsquo;t be alone.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Long career for randomness</title>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added new webring to footer. Finally got added to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://webring.antaresph.dev/&#34;&gt;Pinoy Websites  Webring&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/books&#34;&gt;Books&lt;/a&gt; list to add two new items: &lt;em&gt;Crying in H Mart&lt;/em&gt;
and &lt;em&gt;Fahrenheit 451&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/cv&#34;&gt;CV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t tell anyone, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been out for most days.
Two weeks later, I&amp;rsquo;m back with some life updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;longtermism&#34;&gt;Longtermism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with a friend when they said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Longtermism devalues people who are alive today because of tyranny of
large numbers. People who are into this idea are likely to build
Omelas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Omelas is a fictional place made up by writer Ursula K. Le Guin,
the story of which (&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;) you can read
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/omelas.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (pdf).
This &amp;ldquo;utopia&amp;rdquo; exists because of the misery of a child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People have been saying that we live in strange times,
and it&amp;rsquo;s always true Now.
More so that there are promoters of longtermism at the height of
development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).
Because I believe that AGI sits somewhat opposite of the values of longtermism,
but it could just be me.
And I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan of both, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-thinking-of-pursuing-grad-school&#34;&gt;On thinking of pursuing grad school&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m at this point &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/137/#thinking-about-career&#34;&gt;again&lt;/a&gt; when the glory of grad school is crushing me on
emotional waves.
Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t I be skeptical of my own motivations and desires?
The more I think of it, the weirder it feels,
because the allure of grad school is &amp;ldquo;only&amp;rdquo; for high-performing students,
and I was never one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had applied in the past, all of which were rejected, perhaps to remind
me that there are indeed better use of my time.
Moreover, there&amp;rsquo;s a special preparation needed to learn something
I might not need right away,
and I&amp;rsquo;m leaning on how it might be my wasteful tendencies disagreeing on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applied math seems like a good idea for post-grad study,
but it quickly becomes stale when I&amp;rsquo;m reminded that I didn&amp;rsquo;t come
from a math degree.
Is liking math enough of an incentive?
One that I can think of right now:
I want to be good at math so I can write an elegant proof.
The last time I came close to doing this was back in high school
geometry.
It was probably basic, but I&amp;rsquo;m always grateful for our
geometry teacher. Thanks, Mrs. E_____o!
Because of her, I enjoyed writing proofs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess the only thing that&amp;rsquo;s doing the thing is doing the thing.
My progress so far is thinking of doing the thing,
which is not progress at all, i.e., not doing the thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could also start reading math books.
But in order to learn, experts say that I need a teacher.
Maybe the internet would be a great one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Related: can I teach math for a living?
I mean we do need better teachers who would treat math like art.
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure, though, if I&amp;rsquo;m going to be a good teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When learning/teaching math,
according to Randy Palisoc,
take the language approach.
Not only is math an art, it&amp;rsquo;s also language!
Even Galileo was quoted to have said so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;barangay-elections-2023&#34;&gt;Barangay Elections 2023&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candidates used the same old tactics during the short campaign period.
One of the nastiest was blasting &amp;ldquo;election jingles.&amp;rdquo;
What they did was to moung a large speaker atop a vehicle,
and the vehicle would circuit the neighborhood throughout the day,
all the while blasting tacky songs with stolen melodies from latest pop tunes.
That&amp;rsquo;s one song-blasting per candidate.
&lt;em&gt;All&lt;/em&gt; of them had done this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never mind that there are people:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;working from home (like me)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sleeping and/or resting during daytime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;who have aversion to loud noises because of some physical and/or
mental condition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candidates running for office continue to disregard our well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;random-thoughts&#34;&gt;Random thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bad UX is bad security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid to be an idealist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;None&amp;rdquo; is considered plural.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the month of Oct 2023, these are the albums I listened to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Album Name&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Artist&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Tracy Chapman&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Tracy Chapman&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;KNOWER FOREVER&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;KNOWER&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;The 1975&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Whack World&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Tierra Whack&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite among the bunch would be Tracy Chapman&amp;rsquo;s self-title album.
While understandably US-centric, it sounds very
&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_personal_is_political&#34;&gt;The personal is political.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Close second would be &lt;em&gt;KNOWER FOREVER&lt;/em&gt; which showcases the serious
playfulness of the duo.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sliding in &amp; out of sleep</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/144/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 21 Oct 2023 10:42:59 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/144/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minor edit in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/about&#34;&gt;About&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most days at home are spent slacking, slouching,
and generally sliding in and out consciousness.
Lately, the grey&amp;rsquo;s runtime at zenith has exposed me to unfavorable
weather conditions when I&amp;rsquo;m out and about.
This might also explain the surge of number of people coughing and sniffing.
Flu season is in the air,
in time for Halloween,
which coincidentally, also is tangential to celebrating death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could say that the weather also explains my experiencing of lethargy,
and that would be the end of it.
I could also &amp;ldquo;sleep the evil&amp;rdquo; out of me,
but really, sleep cannot exorcise the tangled spirits within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;brief-review-of-crying-in-h-mart&#34;&gt;Brief Review of &lt;em&gt;Crying in H Mart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like this memoir of Michelle Zauner (Japanese Breakfast),
who not only is a fellow Aries but
also shares the same birthday as mine!
That&amp;rsquo;s it. That&amp;rsquo;s the review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kidding aside, I find the prose easy enough to read but not bland,
purple enough to hear the author&amp;rsquo;s distinct voice and feel what they
had felt through the joy and suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bike-messenger&#34;&gt;Bike Messenger&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend recently told us that they will be going to Europe for a new
opportunity there, and we naturally felt happy for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have actually been thinking that if I ever got lucky enough to get
into Europe or, gods forbid, North America,
I&amp;rsquo;d be a bike messenger.
Top of mind, it&amp;rsquo;s the only blue collar job that I can think of
that I &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; enjoy.
Coming from the Global South, I&amp;rsquo;d expect that jobs,
especially non-tech ones, for PoCs like me
aren&amp;rsquo;t going to be easy to snag.
So maybe, I&amp;rsquo;d have better chances as a bike messenger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is, I have a poor sense of direction.
I can easily get lost in new places.
But that can be ammended by technology through the use of GPS, right?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Randomness in Muzak and Rides to Work</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/143/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2023 01:57:05 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/143/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited some details &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/foss&#34;&gt;FOSS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Staring into the distance is the on-going side quest that I&amp;rsquo;m
meant to do so long as at least one of my eyes work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;skipping-muzak&#34;&gt;Skipping Muzak&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of this year, I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to albums in their
entirety, going in order from track 1 to the last.
It&amp;rsquo;s a habit that I had stopped doing when I entered college,
which was also around the time when my sibling gifted me my first and only
iPod Shuffle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a friend told me back then,
&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re life is already chaotic as it is;
why would you want your playlist to be on shuffle?&amp;rdquo;
We both chuckled at his remark,
but I knew he was right.
It probably is not the brightest idea to throw randomness in one&amp;rsquo;s
listening habits, but there we were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Side note: same friend who seemingly cared for my well-being
encouraged me to start smoking around the same time,
because it looked cool.
I have long since quit smoking.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately, it got me thinking:
I inherited this habit&amp;mdash;i.e., not listening
to the full album&amp;mdash;from people closest to me!
My parents would often skip songs in albums,
and/or just jump right into the one or two songs that they like
before changing to the next CD.
My sibling who gave the iPod was no different.
And then I was no different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N&lt;em&gt;oOo&lt;/em&gt;w, we&amp;rsquo;re in the age of music when we&amp;rsquo;re becoming less interested in
song titles and tend to skip them completely. Access to information,
blazing fast, could not have egged listeners (like me) to pause and look
at the metadata, know the artist, know the song. In randomized
playlists, only parts of lyrics and their melodies are recognizable. At
least, that&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s happening to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cycling-as-commute-to-and-from-work&#34;&gt;Cycling as commute to and from Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to be honest.
I like riding bicycles,
and it&amp;rsquo;s likely it will be the case for a long while.
People would hear it from me that I find these machines
one of the greatest inventions of mankind,
probably next to wheel.
And wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you know it, it has,
in this day and age, at least two of them.
Bikes give me freedom&amp;mdash;I&amp;rsquo;m able to traverse long distances
if I only let myself be the master of my own metaphorical flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I don&amp;rsquo;t like about riding bicyles is the infrastructure
(and/or lack thereof) in cities I frequent to.
I don&amp;rsquo;t like how the few narrow bike lanes not only are tokenized by LGU
but are also eventually physically coopted by motorists
(except the lanes with barriers),
like how they coopted sidewalks.
This isn&amp;rsquo;t flight, but urban plight.
And it&amp;rsquo;s draining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At night, when the lights are out and the fur babies have settled
to their nests, my brain brings to surface of the close calls of the day,
recapping Death as it whistles &lt;em&gt;wheew&lt;/em&gt; each time I&amp;rsquo;m almost clipped.
If I hadn&amp;rsquo;t felt fear on the moment it happened,
now is the time shudder.
Overall, not a good feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I feel like I must continue riding to work,
in solidarity with other cyclists, and even pedestrians.
To signal that, indeed, it&amp;rsquo;s possible, if hard,
to move around cities in two wheels.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Burn Through</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/142/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 02 Oct 2023 06:03:50 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/142/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/cv&#34;&gt;CV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over at new work, a coworker mentioned that as we enter Q4 2023,
businesses will burn through their budget this year.
I hadn&amp;rsquo;t thought about it that way,
and I also have no interest in confirming its merit;
but the way those combo of syllables landed just made perfect sense.
The trajectory of busyness, meaningless or otherwise,
will increase when businesses decide it&amp;rsquo;s that season
again to ramp up everything for The Markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Expect the work to pour in&lt;/em&gt;.
In my head, I translated that as &amp;ldquo;Show up.&amp;rdquo;
Of course, I intend to do both whenever
my fine energy soars to acceptable levels,
but not only within work context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On personal spaces, I&amp;rsquo;ve maintained quiet relationships
with the occasional bursts of laughter in right times.
I&amp;rsquo;ve decided September would be when I tone it down
before &amp;ldquo;burning through&amp;rdquo; the coming days.
This is how we all get through the messy parts of adulthood:
mindful usage of wits and puns as coping mechanisms.
People won&amp;rsquo;t always get you when it &amp;ldquo;switch[es] things up&amp;rdquo;
but Try I Will. &lt;em&gt;Always&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s rather a quiet month for me, music-wise.
The only album I listened to was &lt;strong&gt;pop songs 2020&lt;/strong&gt; by BUMPER,
a music (pandemic?) project of Michelle Zauner and Ryan Galloway.
The totality of four songs brings me that non-toxic, non-addictive nostalgia,
and I mean that in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;new-work&#34;&gt;New Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently started on my new job.
As with most jobs, the first week doesn&amp;rsquo;t have much busyness to it.
I suspect that that would change rapidly in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bike rides to and from work, on the other hand,
are more exhausting than before.
Longer exposure to Manila traffic means greater risk of injury
because of, quite possibly, road rage from motorists.
That, combined with the constant rain and floods,
and an average cycling commuter like me might rethink
the benefits of having a bike in rage-filled urban city centers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Waiting for things, people, luck</title>

      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/140/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/foss/#operating-system&#34;&gt;new OS&lt;/a&gt;! My main computer is now running Alpine Linux.
Also edited sections in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/foss&#34;&gt;FOSS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited some sections in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/site&#34;&gt;Site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited some lines &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/cv&#34;&gt;CV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When and where in life did I not wait for anything?
Waiting &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the norm.
And as is the norm, I, too, wait for things to come to our doorstep:
things for a small weekend project that I plan to document and share;
people to show up and finally make good with their words;
luck to turn up and take a good swat on the bad spirits
that fail to understand that we, from time to time,
deserve a breather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;small-weekend-project&#34;&gt;Small Weekend Project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to replace our water station with a more robust one,
made from stainless steel materials,
equipped with ceramic filters.
As I write this, we&amp;rsquo;re still waiting for the few remaining parts
before the assembly can begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s weird that it took me this long to finally push through with this.
I tend to always look out for the best buy,
like how &lt;em&gt;lola&lt;/em&gt; taught us,
but in so doing,
I was indeed paralyzed by analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what I tell myself:
Water is such an integral part of existence,
it only makes sense for us to invest this much time, money, and effort
in building a sustainable solution that will last for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-people-showing-up&#34;&gt;On people showing up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weekend rainfall triggered floods in many parts of Metro Manila,
including in and near the areas where I live.
In fact, it had gotten so bad that a nearby creek overflowed,
flooding the adjacent road,
causing traffic.
We even saw a rescue team, complete with a motorboat,
arriving at the bridge. I hope no one was hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t blame people for not showing up as scheduled;
the water almost got inside our house,
and it probably would had the rain not stopped.
It&amp;rsquo;s because of this that
I told my mother to cancel their plans of visiting
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/feb2022-photos/#day-19&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;where-is-the-luck&#34;&gt;Where is the Luck?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I first thought was a mild drizzle that dampened the mood became worse later.
The sun, and hope for being productive, hid behind big gray clouds.
Or was it &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; volcanic smog from Taal Volcano?
Does it matter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had planned to run some errands before I start on my new work,
but like I said, the weekend didn&amp;rsquo;t pan out well for many of us.
I also knew I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to risk getting stuck outside.
Bad weather, depending on one&amp;rsquo;s privilege at any point in time,
can be an excuse to back out on plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still on a break.
Like many people, this is the fine time to enjoy &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/68/#on-time&#34;&gt;the act of not-doing&lt;/a&gt;.
I both languish and lounge in limbo,
an almost limbless feeling
as we all loop daily through the lull.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while I&amp;rsquo;m a slow reader,
I managed to finish at least one non-fiction book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;review-of-finding-orwell&#34;&gt;Review of &lt;em&gt;Finding Orwell&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that one non-fiction book I just told you about is
&lt;em&gt;Finding Orwell in Burma&lt;/em&gt; by an American journalist,
Emma Larkin, a pseudonym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larkin reports their experience during their travel in Burma&amp;mdash;or
&lt;a href=&#34;https://apnews.com/article/myanmar-burma-different-names-explained-8af64e33cf89c565b074eec9cbe22b72&#34;&gt;if you&amp;rsquo;re a bit confused&lt;/a&gt; like I was at the beginning of this
book, Myanmar&amp;mdash;to trace the footsteps of George Orwell,
who had a non-trivial background in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether people accept it,
the political is in our daily lives.
In Burma, so much so that their existence,
at least during the time of writing of the book (early 2000s),
had been a living terror of paranoia.
Last I checked,
situation hasn&amp;rsquo;t really changed that much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Real art is to be able to imagine something you haven&amp;rsquo;t experienced.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not (yet?) living under a totalitarian regime,
but this book reminded me that information, even when censored,
will always find its way to those who know how to look and listen,
bending even around a black hole if needed to escape its
total annihilation..
And if I may wonder out loud, Burmese people have been creating art
just by being or wanting to live,
which in itself subverts repression in the tiniest ways,
through creative ways: of passing time, of passing radical ideas.
This is not to romanticize the hardships of Burmese, or anyone
living under oppressive &amp;ldquo;government&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the prose, I find large chunks of the book stale.
But just each time I was about to give it up entirely,
the author would pull me back in with an interesting bit.
Now that I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about it,
could it be because that Larkin had the hard task of editing out
personal identifiable data, which made parts of the book
uninteresting for me?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Good Vibes of the Day</title>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added new page, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/books&#34;&gt;Books&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/about&#34;&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/support&#34;&gt;Support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Career-wise, I&amp;rsquo;m in a liminal space.
My last day on my work was yesterday, 11 Sep,
and I only have mixed feelings about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s just a shame that I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to send my own &amp;ldquo;Good Vibes&amp;rdquo; to the
rest of the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admin [of my now ex-employer] started this &amp;ldquo;Good Vibes of the Day&amp;rdquo;,
a newsletter that each employee would send out via email company-wide
everyday to share good vibes.
At the end of each email, the sender would then tag the next employee
to get the chain going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a while, it became a very long thread of unfunny work memes
that took a while to load because the email itself got large with all
the images in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, it just stopped.
I don&amp;rsquo;t exactly know why.
If I did get the chance to send my own version of Good Vibes,
it would be super short and boring,
something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;good-vibes-of-the-day&#34;&gt;Good Vibes of the Day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good day, workmates!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start your day with this song:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nv2wE1nu-E&#34;&gt;PIZZICATO FIVE / スウィート・ソウル・レヴュー&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recommended muzak:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Edited &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/about&#34;&gt;About&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/foss&#34;&gt;FOSS&lt;/a&gt;. I have upgraded my OS to latest Devuan release,
&amp;ldquo;Daedalus&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like clockwork from Dystopia, many, if not all,
malls have set up Christmas decors on Day
1 of September this year.
Surely a sugar baron sings through their speakers.
(And &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodnewspilipinas.com/jose-mari-chan-a-sugar-barons-tips-for-a-better-work-life-balance/&#34;&gt;did he also share tips for a better work-life balance&lt;/a&gt;?)
This is how we celebrate the late-stage capitalism in Global South.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rainy-days&#34;&gt;Rainy days&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;m typing this, the sun is already shining,
bringing in that familiar tropical heat and humidity.
But days ago, it had been raining non-stop,
so much so that our wooden doors,
soaked in rainwater, without forcing them wooden close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was even able to bike to and from work,
which felt great, because it&amp;rsquo;s been weeks since I rode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;thinking-about-career&#34;&gt;Thinking about career&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a fit of minor madness due to a recent late night chat on
existential crises, I browsed through possible graduate programs,
putting my stance on not pursuing grad school on shaky grounds now.
My reason for this renewed jazz: to open up more opportunities
that would bump my salary in the future.
That late-stage thingy I mentioned, sadly, operates in money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/136/#joyful-maths&#34;&gt;Because of my interest in math&lt;/a&gt;,
many of the programs I looked up are a bit related to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a list of possible careers I eyed on,
ordered from most to least relevant to me now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;analytics manager&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;data scientist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;research analyst&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cybersecurity expert&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[technical] product manager&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;statistician&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if I ever get into any of these in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Added &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/about&#34;&gt;About&lt;/a&gt; page in Index.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;joyful-maths&#34;&gt;Joyful Maths&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2023/08/23/eugenia-cheng-on-finding-the-joy-in-maths&#34;&gt;Babbage podcast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://eugeniacheng.com&#34;&gt;Eugenia Cheng&lt;/a&gt;
claims how maths has helped her be a better person,
by developing the way she thinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m no mathematician by any metric.
But back in school,
I&amp;rsquo;d always enjoyed when things clicked for me during maths.
So much so that my first choice when I applied for UPCAT&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; many,
many years back is, no joke, BS Math.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That podcast episode reignited my desire to deep-dive into maths,
for the sake of learning more,
and maybe, I too would get better as a person.
I might go through
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.susanrigetti.com/math&#34;&gt;Susan Rigetti&amp;rsquo;s Math notes&lt;/a&gt;,
starting by reading her recommended popular books.
I will have to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/support/#hardware-support&#34;&gt;obtain an e-ink reader&lt;/a&gt;
though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slightly related&amp;mdash;Tim,
whose blog I follow, has drastically reduced their updates,
likely because &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.timtimestim.com/n/2021-04.html&#34;&gt;they are still studying AI&lt;/a&gt;,
which involves a lot of maths apparently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;work-related&#34;&gt;Work-related&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am in the middle of a transition,
which is always an interesting period,
not that I&amp;rsquo;m regularly in one.
Is there a term for the liminal state between jobs,
like how &amp;ldquo;sembreak&amp;rdquo; is for semesters?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I go from Point A to B,
the work buzz decays from the drab.
To me, this is a good thing.
All falls to place neatly.
If the move is a success,
the transition will have been smooth and quiet,
like how a boring commute should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;addendum-to-hypocrisy&#34;&gt;Addendum to hypocrisy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/134/#on-hypocrisy-and-spirituality&#34;&gt;A while back&lt;/a&gt;,
I shared some of my thoughts regarding hypocrisy,
and I have a few more to say on the matter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As humans, we can never be perfect so long as we contain conflicts.
Our imperfect ways of being brings to life
multiple versions of insincerity,
some of which we&amp;rsquo;re even aware.
This self-awareness, though,
can&amp;rsquo;t be an excuse to harm others or oneself even.
But it can remind us to check in with ourselves
if we&amp;rsquo;re (mis)aligning with our core values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-daily-news&#34;&gt;On daily news&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to think that I&amp;rsquo;m not sick of people.
But every time I doubt that sentiment,
I try to look back on the good things that have happened to me
thanks to a combo of right person/s and luck within proximity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the month of Aug 2023, these are the albums I listened to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Album Name&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Artist&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Blue Planet Eyes&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;The Preatures&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Stick Around For Joy&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;The Sugarcubes&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Hatful of Hollow&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;The Smiths&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Today&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Galaxie 500&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it&amp;rsquo;s the latest one that I went through,
I&amp;rsquo;d recommend &lt;em&gt;Today&lt;/em&gt; to anyone who enjoys shoegazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My least favorite in this bunch would be &lt;em&gt;Blue Planet Eyes&lt;/em&gt;
and I speculate it might have something to do with recency.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added &lt;a href=&#34;https://seekers.araw.xyz/strays/&#34;&gt;new post&lt;/a&gt; over at Araw Seekers blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added new blogs to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/blogroll&#34;&gt;Blogroll&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/cv&#34;&gt;CV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;review-of-klara-and-the-sun&#34;&gt;Review of &lt;em&gt;Klara and the sun&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have recently finished reading &lt;em&gt;Klara and the sun&lt;/em&gt; by Kazuo Ishiguro.
Below is a brief no-spoilers review of the sci-fi novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like how Ishiguro explores the possibility of a more human(e),
spiritual even, side of Artificial Intelligence. Like how, as of
writing, we use generative AI as tools to achieve specific outcomes,
the story&amp;rsquo;s dystopia has found a way to utilize AI as &amp;ldquo;friends&amp;rdquo;,
always there when you need them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also interesting sub-plots that mirror our issues today,
at least one of which shocked me as it seemed out of place (for me).
Another one reminded me of that time when I was left with my &lt;em&gt;lola&lt;/em&gt;
because my parents went abroad to work. I felt lonely then, badly in
need of friends around my age. Sometimes, I get to hangout with my
cousins who lived next door, but those seldom happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The readers are invited to analyze their own beliefs as they go through
the philosophy presented to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finishing the book gave me almost the same feeling after reading
&lt;em&gt;Never Let Me Go&lt;/em&gt;, also by Ishiguro.
Indeed, the two novels share similar themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I recommend the book to people who tries to look in and out of
themselves for &amp;ldquo;what it means to love.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bili-bili-at-cubao-x&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bili Bili&lt;/em&gt; at Cubao X&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gone last 19 Aug to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/bilibilikayodyan/&#34;&gt;Bili Bili&lt;/a&gt; (Instagram link) event.
It was a relatively short trip comprising of browsing stickers and
zines, and sweating heaps with mounds of strangers dressed for the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought two zines from the stall of artist &lt;a href=&#34;https://linktr.ee/dionekong&#34;&gt;Dione Kong&lt;/a&gt; (Linktree link).
In their stall, they had a wire mesh where their artwork were displayed.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t see anyone when I approached the stall.
So I might&amp;rsquo;ve been visibly surprised when a person hiding behind the
mesh beamed &amp;ldquo;Hello!&amp;rdquo;
They joked,
&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re now ready to take your confession.&amp;rdquo;
We laughed. I paid for the two zines, and off I went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much, much later, &lt;em&gt;l&amp;rsquo;esprit de l&amp;rsquo;escalier&lt;/em&gt; finally came to me with a
could&amp;rsquo;ve-been perfect reply to the confession quip:
&amp;ldquo;Forgive me, Father, for I have zine&amp;rsquo;d.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/robots.txt&#34;&gt;robots.txt&lt;/a&gt; file to limit crawlers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-crawlers-crawling&#34;&gt;On crawlers crawling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have recently learned from &lt;a href=&#34;https://brainbaking.com/post/2023/04/is-your-website-training-ai/&#34;&gt;Wouter&amp;rsquo;s post&lt;/a&gt;
that there&amp;rsquo;s a non-trivial possibility that personal sites like this
one
are training AI,
unbeknown to their owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To counter this, I have added a &lt;code&gt;robots.txt&lt;/code&gt; which you can see in the
linked file above.
This (dis)allows certain site crawlers from getting data in this site.
If you have your own personal site,
consider adding this file to yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of writing this, this site &lt;code&gt;ohio.araw.xyz&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;a href=&#34;https://c4-search.apps.allenai.org/?q=ohio.araw.xyz&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Google&amp;rsquo;s C4
dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-hypocrisy-and-spirituality&#34;&gt;On hypocrisy and spirituality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you agree that we are all hypocrites?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;rsquo;s part flaw, part gift as a complex person
in this ever-changing society.
Some are just more so than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;rsquo;m especially wary of hyper-religious people,
because 99.99% of the time,
they are the worst kinds of hypocrites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not easy to catch yourself,
but self-awareness can be learned through practice and experience.
Extremely religious people might find it harder, though,
because they tend to be blinded by their faith.
I would say, &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s fine to not know everything,&amp;rdquo;
but they would get back at me with some weird line like
&amp;ldquo;But my deity can and will help me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get it, really:
we need to &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; in something.
I just think there&amp;rsquo;s more nuance to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Misery keeps us down only because we&amp;rsquo;re helpless to break out
of the concepts that we allow to run in our lives.
Is this why many of us look for comfort somewhere else,
somewhen that isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily tangible, but the literature of which
soothes the spirit somehow?
I get that, really.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blood is Thicker One Year Later</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;blood-donation&#34;&gt;Blood Donation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow, I misunderstood that wisdom-tooth extraction &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a major
operation that would disqualify me to donate blood.
In my head, it&amp;rsquo;s only minor, and according to guidelines,
one can donate blood one month after any minor operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the doctor told me that they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t let me continue,
I felt the need to answer the void from which I was phoned home.
An exaggeration, but a much needed one at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the recent typhoons, the past few weeks were wet all over everywhere.
Shoegazing in cuddle weather deserves its own niche,
but it leaves dirt in bed.
Thus, no one recommends it.
I remember a similar feeling:
smoking cigarettes while rain pours heavily.
We&amp;rsquo;re not in the habit of romanticizing bad habits,&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; though,
so instead of that, I got my hit in these albums last July 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Album Name&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Artist&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;PAGTATAG!&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;SB19&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Jubilee&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Japanese Breakfast&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Since I Left You&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;The Avalanches&lt;/td&gt;

      <title>In Need of Breakthroughs</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/132/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 29 Jul 2023 01:54:33 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/132/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I find time to update this blog.
And when I do, it&amp;rsquo;s mostly &lt;em&gt;an attempt&lt;/em&gt; at being coherent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-passing-things&#34;&gt;On passing things&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know time moves on without needing permission from anyone or anything,
and yet it still amazes me when I pause and think of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past few weeks, though, most of its passing is drowned out
with the sound of rain hitting our roof
and gales whispering deathly through the windows.
We&amp;rsquo;re lucky here that recent typhoons have caused no significant damage
in and around the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-integrity&#34;&gt;On integrity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to maintain integrity in a society
that pushes for convenience.
Doing so will never be a casual effort for an individual.
One is unlikely to achieve it through a strict Morning Routine
if one isn&amp;rsquo;t already a successful person to begin with.
(I can&amp;rsquo;t believe I almost fell for that.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no breakthroughs in keeping Virtue in tact
if not through the friends and family that keep each other accountable,
safe, and courageous in spite of the modern horrors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-taking-chances&#34;&gt;On taking chances&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to rewire the brain to get addicted to thrill-seeking?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t gamble if I can help it,
because I&amp;rsquo;ve seen first hand how playing with odds ruins lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;rsquo;ve known people who fancy taking bigger risks with other people.
Some of them seem to have made peace with whatever the outcome is.
&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s journey that matters, not the destination.&amp;rdquo;
At least, if I understand them correctly, they are willing to bet
on what they believe.
And believing is powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;recent-dreams&#34;&gt;Recent dreams&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s always non-exciting to read some stranger&amp;rsquo;s dreams,
but I&amp;rsquo;ll share them here anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A gay cousin snapped at me for letting my new co-worker sleep on
their bed sans consent. Understandable, but on my defense, I didn&amp;rsquo;t
even know that my co-worker had somehow snuck in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I keep repeating a witty phrase to myself, enough to remember to
share it to a friend who likes capybaras.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone threw a children&amp;rsquo;s party in a gas station, and I was
invited. I left for a bit to get something, but when I came back, the
place was deserted. Did Pied Piper got them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Heavy Familial Things</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/131/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Jul 2023 20:59:07 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/131/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tell me how it works again:
are someone&amp;rsquo;s morals inversely proportional to their wealth?
The common observation follows that as a person gets richer,
the less likely they would believe that manual labor
is worth their time.
Physical work almost always is outsourced,
except maybe when achieving and/or maintaining a desired physique.
And that&amp;rsquo;s weird&amp;mdash;isn&amp;rsquo;t manual labor a form of physical exercise?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I&amp;rsquo;m still thinking about &lt;em&gt;that time&lt;/em&gt; when a certain &lt;em&gt;Chris S.&lt;/em&gt;,
a gym buff[oon], didn&amp;rsquo;t carry &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; two heavy &lt;em&gt;balikbayan&lt;/em&gt; boxes.
Instead, he watched their helper, a woman in her 30s or 40s,
significantly smaller than him, and me do the lifting.
&amp;ldquo;At least, she&amp;rsquo;s getting paid,&amp;rdquo; I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I dislike recalling that time because it only reminds me of
how a collective agreement prevents certain subsets of living creatures
to be inconvenienced by mundane tasks.
When I do, I force myself to go to a calmer state,
so I can, you know, jazz into a smooth existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of smooth existence,
we are again left alone with the furry animals in the old house.
The relatives from abroad have flown back home.
Internal lethargy stabilizes, causing all sorts of familiar things.
Time feels a bit more normal again,
save for that one early Thursday morning when I woke up
feeling it&amp;rsquo;s already Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Weird Retelling of My Name</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/130/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 02 Jul 2023 06:00:11 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/130/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Six months of 2023&amp;mdash;gone.
I wonder if my prime years are flying over me,
and whether in the vertigo of possibilities I am spun out of control.
But wondering can only help me when I try to put them down to writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;triangular-description-in-writing&#34;&gt;Triangular Description in Writing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know if there&amp;rsquo;s a literary term for this,
but I&amp;rsquo;ll try to describe a writing technique I discovered somewhere:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triangle is the simplest geometric plane enclosed in three non-linear points.
In writing, we can think of each of these points as any random object in
a place that can be highlighted to describe the setting or set the tone
of the scene. For example, one could could mention
&amp;ldquo;dusty glass, fake plants, printer paper&amp;rdquo;
to mean one is in an office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;origin-story-of-my-name&#34;&gt;Origin Story of My Name&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope it&amp;rsquo;s obvious by now that I have a unique given name
(see Index page).
Naturally, people are drawn to ask the most obvious question,
so much so that I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of getting the answer to it
tattooed on me because it&amp;rsquo;s FAQ:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why is your name Ohio?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ofc&lt;/em&gt;, the usual follow up questions would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Did your parents &amp;lsquo;make&amp;rsquo; you there?&amp;rdquo; (from people who know where
Ohio, USA, is)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Isn&amp;rsquo;t that Japanese for &amp;lsquo;good morning&amp;rsquo;?&amp;rdquo; (from people who [barely]
know Japanese greetings)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My stock answer is not interesting to warrant more questions,
but it&amp;rsquo;s the one I got from my parents,
so that would have to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, until, a family friend suggested a better narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They speculated that my parents might be the progressive type
because, in this friend&amp;rsquo;s mind, my name was inspired by
the protest song
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_(Crosby,_Stills,_Nash_%26_Young_song)&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ohio&lt;/em&gt; by Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I doubt that my parents thought of that,
but it&amp;rsquo;s definitely better,
and with my partner&amp;rsquo;s blessing,
it&amp;rsquo;s the story that I&amp;rsquo;m okay to tell people from now on
when they ask the origin of my name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the month of June 2023, I managed to go through the following
albums, one-half of which comes from the same artist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Album Name&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Artist&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Desire, I Want To Get Into You&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Caroline Polachek&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Pang&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Caroline Polachek&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Losers/Lovers EP&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Orchards&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Pollen&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Tennis&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, muzak has helped me survive this month.
The concoction of esoteric and upbeat tunes held my hand and walked me
away from the awful feelings I acquired from things and events beyond my
control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not an adept weaver, at least not yet, but if I had to,
I&amp;rsquo;d say the overarching theme across these four projects is
that weird can feel good, and at times that it does,
one should embrace it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Writing, Reviewing</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/129/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 23 Jun 2023 22:31:20 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/129/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My friends and I talked about our creative endeavors, and how work-life
balance, or lack thereof, impacts our individual pursuits.
As someone who &lt;em&gt;sometimes&lt;/em&gt;
write creatively as a hobby,
I said, &amp;ldquo;I only write what I like to write.&amp;rdquo; One of my
friends rightfully, and almost painfully, reminded me that Work also
requires me &amp;ldquo;to write.&amp;rdquo; So, there&amp;rsquo;s also that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;writing-humor&#34;&gt;Writing Humor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sometimes think of writing a whole stand-up comedy routine, but I know
that stuff&amp;rsquo;s hard to produce. My current level is coming up with the best
puns on the spot, but if I&amp;rsquo;m being honest with myself, they are a
mix of hits and misses. To construct a whole narrative that constantly
delivers a funny punchline - that&amp;rsquo;s hard. For me to do that,
I imagine having someone to
banter with on stage, &lt;em&gt;à la&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&lt;/em&gt; improv stuff.
And to be honest, I may not have the right stage presence.
Yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, it would be a nice side project that I could maybe perform for
families and friends, if they&amp;rsquo;re willing to sit through the whole
ordeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;writing-for-fun&#34;&gt;Writing for Fun&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only write what I like to write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even that&amp;rsquo;s hard. Updating this log doesn&amp;rsquo;t even get the consistency
I want. The plan was to post a weekly update. But time flies,
and life around me gels into and out of Being,
whether I know it or not. Writing consistently &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a challenge, given
all the busyness of a modern salaried worker like myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to write about anything,
don&amp;rsquo;t we have to consume many things?
Reading, watching, listening, observing the world around us&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I should start writing reviews (weekly?) of all things that come
my way and/or of things I have interacted with: places I&amp;rsquo;ve visited,
food I&amp;rsquo;ve eaten, media I&amp;rsquo;ve seen/watched/listened to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, I&amp;rsquo;ll start now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;review-bike-lane-in-edsa-northbound&#34;&gt;REVIEW: Bike lane in EDSA northbound&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a short review of the bike lane in EDSA Northbound, specifically
from East Ave going to North Ave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s trash, bordering dangerous. Motorists barely respect the existence
of bike lane,
especially that the only divider is a painted line that, quite
literally, gradually fades.
Of course, traffic enforcers have never been of great help.
We often joke that they are the complete opposite of help,
as they enforce traffic, see?
Anyway, sometimes these uniformed people block the bike lanes
themselves, and/or enable unsafe conditions for cyclists,
such as allowing public buses to park over bike lanes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imagine that the bike lanes on the entire length of EDSA look and
feel the same&amp;mdash;barely safe &amp;ldquo;but at least it&amp;rsquo;s there.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Honesty [&amp;] of Self</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/128/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 13 Jun 2023 21:44:08 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/128/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My go-to answer when asked in a corporate setting what I like to do
is, &amp;ldquo;I like learning.&amp;rdquo;
It&amp;rsquo;s one of the safest answers that&amp;rsquo;s still
true given the context, even outside work.
Really, I like learning things I like.
The rest will have to wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I recently learned about myself that, at best,
I have mixed feelings going up the corporate ladder.
It&amp;rsquo;s as if I&amp;rsquo;m being abstracted away from &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rsquo;s on the ground.&amp;rdquo;
And the spreadsheets&amp;mdash;they are everywhere I look!
I don&amp;rsquo;t like it at all.
Honestly, I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/Pfm_Yc1Vly0&#34;&gt;Sincerely Overwhelmed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still within the realm of honesty [and] about oneself: I tightrope now
between feeling &lt;em&gt;meh&lt;/em&gt; about work and feeling the need to be recognized.
The latter is the weirder one to address, because I&amp;rsquo;m not one to seek
recognition for my work from colleagues. But the truth is, it hurts
no one if people nod my way from time to time. And they &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;! Some of my
workmates&amp;mdash;bless their onshore hearts&amp;mdash;have given me praises, and I
might&amp;rsquo;ve lost a few hours of sleep thinking about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole post, so far, looks like it&amp;rsquo;s the result of me giving in to
my undiagnosed neurodivergent tendency to share seemingly inappropriate
things to people (read: you, readers), which could be an effect of
daydreaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last example of this tendency:
I just watched &lt;em&gt;A Star Is Born&lt;/em&gt; (2018) dir. by Bradley Cooper.
And I recall an online friend from the past telling me that this film
reminded them of me. Spoiler: Tragic ending.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Missing out on Cool Things?</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/127/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 31 May 2023 15:10:42 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/127/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-not-being-in-mainstream-socmeds&#34;&gt;On not being in mainstream socmeds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a weird feeling how I&amp;rsquo;m missing out on interesting things
because I&amp;rsquo;m not on mainstream social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When something cool is announced in any of these platforms,
I would only hear of it when someone in my orbit shares this to me,
either in person or via online chat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few workarounds, though, to not miss out:
one of them,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://nitter.net/about&#34;&gt;Nitter&lt;/a&gt;,
an alternative Twitter frond-end,
provides RSS feed.
I could subscribe to the RSS feed of tweets of some creator
so that I&amp;rsquo;d be updated.
And I am doing that right now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Philippines, though, Facebook is more popular.
Hence, creators focus more of their efforts there.
What sucks for me is, as of this writing,
I don&amp;rsquo;t know of any alternative
FB front-end that provides RSS.
When friends share a FB post to me,
most of the time, I&amp;rsquo;m redirected to the sign-up page
before I have even gotten a glimpse of what was it about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;do-i-go-back&#34;&gt;Do I go back?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if I go back to, say, FB,
would I be soaking in hate speech, disinformation, and noise?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d be lying if I say I don&amp;rsquo;t think of it.
&amp;ldquo;What would I lose?&amp;rdquo; I would rationalize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has to be a sustainable way to filter all that, or
at the very least, wade through the mess
without losing one&amp;rsquo;s mind or falling to a problematic mindset.
Could that be done by being mindful of the people and pages
that one decides to befriend and/or follow?
My friends and family are still in these platforms,
and to me, they seem okay,
so they must be doing something that&amp;rsquo;s working for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;weather&#34;&gt;Weather&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent weather is hot.
It is humid.
Then, it is rainy,
and the mud splatters on my back when I ride my bike on wet roads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also getting hard to get good, quality sleep.
On the blue corner:
Raging mosquitos that are out to get us.
On the red corner:
It&amp;rsquo;s the weather&amp;mdash;stuffy, moist, and heavy.
Somehow, the latter is the lesser discomfort.
But both are not cool at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This May 2023, I have listened to an interesting mix of albums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Album Name&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Artist&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Subconsciously&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Black Coffee&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;The Best of Sade&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Sade&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Charango&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Morcheeba&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Come To My Garden&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Minnie Riperton&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Post&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Bjork&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Untrue&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Burial&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;2012 &amp;ndash; 2017&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Against All Logic&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice how majority of them are electronic music albums.
And yet my favorite this month is the odd one, &lt;em&gt;The Best of Sade&lt;/em&gt;.
I recognized some songs before I even heard their entirety,
because they have been sampled in other songs by other artists.
I had exclaimed several times, &amp;ldquo;So, this is where [ARTIST] sampled it from!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than any of that,
I like how complex the emotions that Sade evokes in each track,
as if I had gone through them in the past&amp;mdash;I haven&amp;rsquo;t for most&amp;mdash;and
that I must live it again,
each time a more soulful iteration of the previous one.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>WHO upsets WfH</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/126/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 21 May 2023 05:51:05 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/126/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited some lines in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/blogroll&#34;&gt;Blogroll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited lines in the Footer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited some lines, and added a JSON exported from my current Redirector (a browser add-on) in
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/foss&#34;&gt;FOSS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started working remotely at the onset of COVID Pandemic 2020,
it enabled me to do my job at my own pace,
no longer anxious whether someone is watching me.
But the worry of surveillance was replaced with the worry of getting
sick.
Then and now,
I can&amp;rsquo;t afford to get COVID,
and I&amp;rsquo;m relatively healthy.
The effects of long COVID are nothing to laugh at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often question the relevance of both public and private sectors
pushing people to go back to the office (on-site) when,
for a few years now, it&amp;rsquo;s possible to deliver outputs from home,
not despite of, but especially because of,
this non-traditional work setup.
And I often reflect on whether I&amp;rsquo;m looking at it
from pessimistic angle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t help that people, mainstream media included,
get it wrong when they misinterpret World Health Organization&amp;rsquo;s
declaration (WHO), &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1654477334139863041&#34;&gt;last 5 May&lt;/a&gt;, that COVID19 is over &lt;em&gt;as a global health emergency&lt;/em&gt;.
That last part is important.
What WHO meant is that, they&amp;rsquo;re now shifting to long term strategies
to mitigate the harmful effects COVID as it goes on,
because the developed countries failed to contain it.
We can&amp;rsquo;t celebrate when everyone collectively failed to care enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This log offers no solution,
and merely is a rant.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Same soup, reheated</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/125/</link>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/cv&#34;&gt;CV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-are-you-doing&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;How Are You Doing?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve read some interesting possible responses to this question that&amp;rsquo;s
not necessarily mechanical, and still encapsulates my honest feeling
most days these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Same soup, reheated.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Rearranging deck chairs of the Titanic.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hanging in there.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m out of bed and not crying.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Just like this.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m doing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know yet, it&amp;rsquo;s still early.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s to say,
I&amp;rsquo;m teetering between a spectrum of emotions,
as many of us are now.
I think it happens because the mind is much tethered to the flesh.
And the flesh&amp;mdash;well, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to keep it in check
when it decides to seek something it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I promised,
in terms of music album-consuming,
I am now focusing on one album per week.
Despite this significant reduction from &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/122&#34;&gt;March&lt;/a&gt;,
it did make me appreciate each of them more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week, indeed, is enough of a window to assess my feelings toward a particular a
body of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last April, these albums were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Album Name&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Artist&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Everything Was Forever&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Sea Power&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;平庸之上 = Beyond Mediocrity&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;9m88&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Reinventing Axl Rose&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Against Me!&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Dedicated to Bobby Jameson&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Ariel Pink&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know a song is great when one sings the riffs.
Unfortunately, I haven&amp;rsquo;t found such a song in any of these albums,
but that&amp;rsquo;s not to say I didn&amp;rsquo;t find them good.
They all are, by the way, in their own quirky, gritty ways.
I&amp;rsquo;d definitely recommend them to those looking for new music to add to
their playlists.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Shower &amp; Jempoy</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/124/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 22 Apr 2023 08:12:24 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/124/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/cv&#34;&gt;CV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since my last update,
I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking of a few things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;shower-game-idea&#34;&gt;Shower Game Idea&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of Drinking Game,
which may not be for everyone,
I propose Shower Game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanics are simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wash your face each time you say &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Ang init!&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a shower each time you say &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Ang init!&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; followed by an expletive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open a fire hydrant each time you include &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Ang init!&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; in a paragraph full of
expletives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dance in the rain if your rain dance did make it rain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jempoy&#34;&gt;Jempoy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent small talk with a co-worker,
we went over my preferred mode of transportation,
the humblest single-speed bike,
more specifically, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/50&#34;&gt;my fixed-gear bike&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My read of our conversation is,
he&amp;rsquo;s both fascinated and spooked by the thought
of traversing the urban hellscape of Metro Manila
using a simple yet effective machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term &lt;em&gt;jempoy&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;a slang for errant, reckless cyclists&amp;mdash;was
also thrown in the air.
I don&amp;rsquo;t think he&amp;rsquo;s implied I&amp;rsquo;m one&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
although I can almost feel that he might have dealt first hand with one
in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reassured him that despite riding fixed,
I&amp;rsquo;m not a jempoy:
I wear a helmet,
I have foot retention,
and I have a brake.
On top of all that,
I follow traffic rules&amp;hellip;
most of the time.
I&amp;rsquo;m such a snob,
that I don&amp;rsquo;t even subscribe to the niche culture
among local fixie riders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ride-to-work&#34;&gt;Ride to Work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still on the orbit of bicycles,
I get little praises at work when people find out
that I just ride my bike to work,
to which I often respond with,
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m lucky to live (relatively) nearby to be able to do this,&amp;rdquo;
or
&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s just around 5 km one way anyway, or around 30 mins.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cycling offers me so much freedom in terms of urban mobility,
and I can only wish that many more able-bodied people join in the fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand their amazement,
because five or so years ago,
I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t dare do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But so many things have changed since the Pandemic,
and lots of people have been radicalized.
One of the good things that came out of it is,
we now have more bike lanes in the Metro,
thanks to those radical cyclists who had demanded dedicated lanes
for cyclists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In local cycling scenes, fixie riders like myself are sometimes branded as jempoys.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added a &lt;a href=&#34;https://seekers.araw.xyz/eulogy/&#34;&gt;new post over at the Araw Seekers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added new section, &lt;em&gt;Similar Project/s&lt;/em&gt;, on &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/dada&#34;&gt;Dada&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added 15 new entries to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt;, making it practically
complete at this point!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited some wordings in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/foss&#34;&gt;FOSS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited a few lines in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/support&#34;&gt;Support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removed some items in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/blogroll&#34;&gt;Blogroll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;clout-chasing&#34;&gt;Clout Chasing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The marathon to chase clout goes on in many social media sites.
As many people race to come up with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/99&#34;&gt;wittiest quips&lt;/a&gt;
and hottest takes,
who has time to pause and consider that nuance matters?
When it&amp;rsquo;s easy to make sweeping generalizations about anything really,
thinking before clicking is that thin line between hard work and supernatural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m generally an impatient person,
something that I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on.
That&amp;rsquo;s why I kind of understand why people are eager
to say something on a topic&amp;mdash;a first impression,
an initial review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it&amp;rsquo;s something that I&amp;rsquo;ll question daily.
Not to exactly to rant about it,
but to hopefully to learn more about myself as I reflect on these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;holy-week-2023&#34;&gt;Holy Week, 2023&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stayed at home when most of the &amp;ldquo;main characters&amp;rdquo; of Metro Manila
rushed out of town to spend the holidays with bodies of water.
Not going with the crowd is always a good decision;
staycation is bit better.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>M is for the Muzak in March</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/122/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;March 2023 was an okay month for me.
The first half I spent alone and in the coziness of bold, cold bedroom.
The second half I have spent with the warm body that is my partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;music-albums&#34;&gt;Music Albums&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a list of albums I completed this month.
A lot of them is &lt;em&gt;meh&lt;/em&gt;, which to be honest, is an unfair judgment,
knowing that I only listened to each once,
and only in the background while I&amp;rsquo;m doing something,
usually Work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will this be a monthly tradition? I don&amp;rsquo;t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Album Name&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-listen-to-an-album&#34;&gt;How to Listen to an Album&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend found it odd when I told them that I go through,
on current average,
one album a day.
They said (non-verbatim) that shit isn&amp;rsquo;t sustainable.
No one could possibly process and/or enjoy an album on that rate.
And they have a point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of my coping mechanism while at work
is to have music playing in the background.
This tactic, while it softens the impact of dread of work,
sacrifices the aesthetics imbued by the artist
when they compiled their music into an album.
I have reduced their work to ambience instead of it being my main focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To atone for my sins,
I will try to limit my rate of consumption to one album per week,
but I could listen to it daily, capped at once per day.
I will try to be present in at least one of the sittings
to enjoy the textures of sounds, the nuances of harmony,
and all that good (and bad)shite.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Going, Glowing, Growing, Gluing REAL</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/121/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Mar 2023 05:36:36 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/121/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added 15 new entries in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People in my orbit have noted that Aries season
is truly here, its nostrils flaring 33-degree-Celsius humid air.
A tropical climate fitting for the ram trope of hot-headedness.
It would be foolish to be out and about when the sun nears zenith.
But many still risk it for whatever valid reason
despite higher chances of heat stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In feeling this, I&amp;rsquo;m reassured that all of this is Real.
I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt;, too, because the sensations of sweat forming on my skin
and it evaporating could not have stemmed from
Large Language Models and the supercomputers that run them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I was a kid, I questioned the very nature of Reality.
Much later, I found out I was already toying with &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism&#34;&gt;solipsism&lt;/a&gt;
at an early age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than two decades later,
we have ChatGPT at our disposal that allows us
&lt;a href=&#34;https://maggieappleton.com/ai-dark-forest&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;to drown in a sea of pedestrian takes,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;
as Maggie Appleton puts it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; not much of a swimmer,
but my way of going against these waves of lukewarm deluge of generic texts
is to maintain &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/site&#34;&gt;this wabi-sabi of a site&lt;/a&gt;,
replete with its &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; grammatical errors disguising as neo-Dada musings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you prove you&amp;rsquo;re human? &lt;a href=&#34;https://manuelmoreale.com/verified-human&#34;&gt;Manu Moreale shares his thoughts&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no blue checkmark&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to prove it but I am, a human&amp;hellip;
It sounds rather bizarre to even think about,
but with all the advancements in machine learning,
large language models and AIs,
it won&amp;rsquo;t be long before the internet is filled with &amp;ldquo;non-humans&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To even ask for proof is absurd at this point.
Is it even a worthwhile task?
That I&amp;rsquo;m existing despite the harsh conditions I live in
should be enough that my Here and Now is as Real as everyone else&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; is positive integer greater than 1.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most social media sites at the time of writing,
having a blue checkmark means the account is &amp;ldquo;verified.&amp;rdquo;
Tumblr took this further and added the colors of the rainbow,
and more, when &amp;ldquo;buying&amp;rdquo; (yes, it can now be bought) a checkmark.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Disco Elysium</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/120/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 19 Mar 2023 01:56:58 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/120/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I finished my first run of the game &lt;em&gt;Disco Elysium&lt;/em&gt;,
a detective RPG designed and written by an Estonian novelist,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kurvitz&#34;&gt;Robert Kurvitz&lt;/a&gt;,
with art direction by &lt;a href=&#34;https://rostovjanka.artstation.com/&#34;&gt;Aleksander Rostov&lt;/a&gt;,
and music by &lt;a href=&#34;https://seapowerband.com/&#34;&gt;Sea Power&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;rsquo;s great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are more coherent, well-written reviews out there.
Below is a list of my own takes (with mild spoilers?)
on the game so far.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;review-of-the-game&#34;&gt;Review of the game&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with all media,
music helps set the atmosphere.
DE ensures that each location has its own ambient music.
This matters because when done correctly&amp;mdash;and
the devs have done it correctly&amp;mdash;it
amplifies the emotions in important moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disco Elysium OST, by Sea Power, of course, is available on Spotify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;prose&#34;&gt;Prose&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game is rich in prose.
It&amp;rsquo;s so purple, I chew it with my mouth,
&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; listen to its wine-poisoned melody.
Too rich for some, maybe,
but I find it refreshing
in that it&amp;rsquo;s unlikely a modern gamer has experienced anything like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weaving of multiple languages,
including some new fantastic combination of syllables,
with English as its skeleton,
will stimulate any linguists in the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DE is a dialog-based choose-your-own-adventure book-turned-video-game,
so the most action that the player would see is the running around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, if you&amp;rsquo;d say,
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;d rather read a novel than play this &amp;lsquo;video game&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;
I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t blame you.
I might even nod in agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, go ahead and read.
I hope your novel has great visual art that goes with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read&amp;mdash;&lt;em&gt;along&lt;/em&gt; with the narrator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;voice-acting&#34;&gt;Voice Acting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could be wrong,
but it certainly &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; like a big chunk of the budget went into VA.
Such speculation makes sense&amp;mdash;how
else can storytelling be more compelling if not told
by someone with a deep voice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pcgamer.com/we-talk-to-disco-elysiums-incredible-narrator-who-recorded-350000-words-of-dialogue-and-has-never-acted-before/&#34;&gt;Lenval Brown did most of the narration&lt;/a&gt;,
and to be that defining voice of the game
gave the purple-prose narrative a melancholic yet soothing vibe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s nice to listen to different textures in the dialog,
to pick up the subtle differences in the voices,
but some exchange can get boring, for me at least,
especially those info dumps that let you in on the world
through the protagonist&amp;rsquo;s perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, if your type of adventure is an interactive podcast,
you&amp;rsquo;ll love DE!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;world-building&#34;&gt;World Building&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DE builds the world of Elysium with believable realism.
It even includes complex socio-economic and -political themes,
drawing from real-world philosophies and ideologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20201202012348/https://zaumstudio.com/2017/03/31/the-hungarian-interview/&#34;&gt;From Kurvitz in an interview&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has geopolitical credibility.
In this world there are states, nations, boring political parties, NGOs,
and defunct monarchies hanging on to tabloid media to maintain the final threads of relevance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work of fiction,
absurdity is tastefully blended in,
so the player really has to pay attention,
lest the plot confuses them quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When that happens,
it helps to step back and let it simmer for a while.
It can get pretty heavy on details so no one is advised to speedrun this thing.
It&amp;rsquo;s a long game that won&amp;rsquo;t unfold on the first few hours of gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take your time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get some rest and internalize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;uiux&#34;&gt;UI/UX&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;User interface does not get in the way of storytelling
with its clean yet oil-painting art and design.
When coupled with interesting mechanics,
it offers the player a billion and one ways
to explore this D&amp;amp;D.
That&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;death &amp;amp; decay&lt;/em&gt; for you, dungeons &amp;amp; dragons fans.
Or &lt;em&gt;drama &amp;amp; deduction&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were to nitpick, though,
it can be awkward 0.1% of the time.
Sometimes, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t click a highlighted item,
but re-pressing Tab or pause-unpausing the game seems to fix this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;heavy-themes&#34;&gt;Heavy Themes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DE confronts the player with notions like self-destruction,
alcoholism, and drug abuse,
and&amp;mdash;no joke&amp;mdash;may actually be triggering for some who might be going through a
similar phase in their life.
More than just plot devices, these themes are there to explore
how one&amp;rsquo;s actions and decisions affect oneself as much as the people around.
Choosing one&amp;rsquo;s annihilation is a personal verdict, yes,
but it&amp;rsquo;s a choice that cannot happen in a vacuum.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
I remind myself this during those times when the Void pops in my orbit
for no reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are more heavy themes, including,
but not limited to,
failed revolutions,
poverty, etc.
I won&amp;rsquo;t discuss them further lest I spoil the experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;when-capitalism-ofc-shows-whos-boss&#34;&gt;When Capitalism, &lt;em&gt;ofc&lt;/em&gt;, shows who&amp;rsquo;s Boss&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, as rich and dense as the world of Elysium is,
we may never have a sequel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: ZA/UM Studio kicked out the original creators of the DE,
as outlined in this &lt;a href=&#34;https://old.reddit.com/r/DiscoElysium/comments/11tvv9f/whats_the_big_deal_its_just_a_photo_mode_a_short/&#34;&gt;Reddit post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just finished this game today,
and now I&amp;rsquo;m met with this sad news,
which isn&amp;rsquo;t even new at this point.
These happened months ago already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, we still live in &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; reality, sadly.
One where a body of work that criticizes capitalism in an engaging way
is itself bastardized by that very system.
One that practically motivates rich people to steal works of art with little consequence.
Not disco, those lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These notes are based on my first run of the game.
I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ll uncover more good bits as I replay it one or a few more times in
the future.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>One Cold March Night</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/119/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 06 Mar 2023 01:38:38 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/119/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t recall the last time March was this relatively cold.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s during one of these cold nights that I had
one of the most intense nightmares so far,
and the friends I told about it agree:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A beige or white sedan stopped at the front of the house,
with its windows rolled down.
The four men inside didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to care
whether the neighborhood would remember how they looked.
From nowhere inside did each of them pull high-powered rifles
and pointed the nozzles to my direction.
When I realized what&amp;rsquo;s going to happen,
I ducked behind the log in our front yard,
praying it&amp;rsquo;s thick and hard enough to shield me
for when the bullets would rain down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I woke up with my mouth open.
Was I supposed to be yelling?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a tropical urban area like Metro Manila,
22 degrees Celsius at night is cold.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Back to Albums</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/118/</link>

&lt;li&gt;Edited footer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a long bout against the ills of the shuffle button,
I have rediscovered the value of listening through an album
as the artist had intended.
Who would&amp;rsquo;ve thought it&amp;rsquo;s better than
shuffling between songs between &lt;em&gt;multiple&lt;/em&gt; albums &lt;em&gt;across&lt;/em&gt;
multiple artists?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month,
I allowed myself to &amp;ldquo;get in the zone&amp;rdquo;
while an album of choice is playing in my environment,
skipping no song.
Just playing it one after the other,
from start to finish.
It&amp;rsquo;s a nice change of pace to go with the flow,
and not musical chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list below, in no particular order,
doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily contain albums that I haven&amp;rsquo;t heard yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Album Name&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Artist&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Crazy For You&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Best Coast&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;These Are Good People.&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Little Big League&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Flesh Balloon&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Pale Saints&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Clean up of HTML and CSS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added image in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/foss&#34;&gt;FOSS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This update is long overdue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cold breeze still comes in throughout the day,
despite being mid-February already.
I feel like the future is loaning us a few more days of nice weather,
so that when 2024 or 2025 rolls around,
we would have to pay and deal with
scorching hot days 99.9% of the time,
enough to clean this world of unwanted &lt;em&gt;germs&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isya and I have waltzed in and out of social events
since the start of the month.
To continue the metaphor,
our future selves loaned us extra extrovert energy for these affairs,
it looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hibernation is a promising activity that we both can slip into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;occupation&#34;&gt;Occupation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am pushed a step up in our corporate ladder.
More workload, though, won&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean better compensation,
at least not right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this mean I&amp;rsquo;m loaning them more effort for free?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;recovery-relaxation&#34;&gt;Recovery, Relaxation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good times these past few weeks usually come in a haze
of moving pictures and shoegazing.
I, of course, like spending them with loved ones around.
But don&amp;rsquo;t we just need more of this and less&amp;hellip; stress?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;motivation&#34;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wrap up this update
(which, in terms of effort,
I can only give a &lt;em&gt;hmph!&lt;/em&gt; out of 10 score)
with a line I wrote in a journal last Valentine&amp;rsquo;s day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t feel anything today.
Coffeee keeps me in check,
it seems,
but that&amp;rsquo;s hardly a scientific observation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I can say is, I may have had too much coffee that day.
When it&amp;rsquo;s effect wore off,
caffeine allowed me to crumble on borrowed time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What&#39;s in a name?</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/116/</link>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added 10 new entries and 4 new one-liners to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filipinos can come up with weird and exciting names for their offspring.
Depending on who you ask,
it can be a source of concern because the child
would likely be bullied when they grow up;
or it can be, uh, an ice breaker, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet has recently reminded me of
the siblings named &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.abs-cbn.com/lifestyle/01/10/14/meet-siblings-macaroni-85-spaghetti-88-sincerely-yours-98&#34;&gt;Macaroni 85, Spaghetti 88, and Sincerely Yours 98&lt;/a&gt;,
the numbers indicating the year they were born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weird? Yes, verily so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow, this reminded me of Isaac Asimov&amp;rsquo;s short story,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://astronomy.org/moravian/C00-Last%20Question.pdf&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Last Question&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
Read it if you haven&amp;rsquo;t already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lest I spoil, I&amp;rsquo;ll just say that in the story,
human&amp;rsquo;s names get &amp;ldquo;weirder&amp;rdquo; as they evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So maybe the weird-name-giving weird parents are on to something grand here
that many of us just brush aside as another
byproduct of modern-day absurdity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t noticed,
I myself have a relatively weird name,
and I have mixed feelings about it ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Capricorn</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/115/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 17 Jan 2023 03:58:51 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/115/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added 10 new entries and two new one-liners to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added some words in Index page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;birthdays&#34;&gt;Birthdays&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The homestretch of Capricorn season,
according to the horoscope,
looms right after Mid-January,
when all things cold gradually absorbs that familiar heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could weather be a major factor that drives people insane?
I would think so,
based on my own experience.
I recall feeling down on at least two different instances
the past few days.
They would then be dispelled by sleep or sunrise,
whichever comes first.
This leads me to ask,
&amp;ldquo;Is enlightenment predicated on varying degrees of mental breakdown?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know at least four people who celebrated their birthday
on the same day, 9 Jan.
Each of them, I&amp;rsquo;d like to think,
are enlightened in their own little ways.
And they all don&amp;rsquo;t know each other.
I have no good excuse to introduce them to one another.
There&amp;rsquo;s nothing wrong, though,
with being the common denominator
of strangers who only have their birthdays as that one
string tying them together.
It&amp;rsquo;s just that the logistics are too much for my lethargic self to start,
the reward being inversely proportional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;video-games&#34;&gt;Video Game/s&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have that something that regularly occurs to you every year?
For me it&amp;rsquo;s seasonal flu&amp;hellip;
and seasonal enthusiasm for video gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I have entered that annual phase
during which I&amp;rsquo;m scouring again our library
comprising mostly of games with gun and/or sword fights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around this time last year,
we were going through &lt;em&gt;GTA IV&lt;/em&gt;.
And we kept at it for a few more weeks,
before dropping it completely when February rolled in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before that, I reran &lt;em&gt;Diablo 2&lt;/em&gt;,
and I honestly don&amp;rsquo;t recall beating Baal on the Normal difficulty
using a Weather Druid build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before that, we were rolling with &lt;em&gt;Katamari Damacy&lt;/em&gt;,
which at the time, and even now,
would be impossible for us to speedrun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before that&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to numb
the depressing effects of cold weather
by rerunning &lt;em&gt;Fallout: New Vegas&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Own Timeline</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/114/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 08 Jan 2023 13:22:44 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/114/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the world transitions from one calendar year to the next last week,
it&amp;rsquo;s always nice to remember the small wins that permeate
the daily life, that make the mundane slightly more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no interest in keeping up with a yearly resolution
when I know that it&amp;rsquo;s not &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; point.
If I need to remind myself, though,
it&amp;rsquo;s to not compare my timeline with others&#39;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-depending-on-tech&#34;&gt;On Depending on Tech&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I go off-grid, the world won&amp;rsquo;t know.
&amp;ldquo;Of course!&amp;rdquo; you&amp;rsquo;d exclaim.
Interestingly, in the age of social media,
people going off-grid share their experiences
if/when they go off-grid.
And that&amp;rsquo;s not necessarily a bad thing!
For me, I&amp;rsquo;d like to learn from these &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Luddism&#34;&gt;neo-Luddites&lt;/a&gt;
who try to reject the modern pulls of the systems in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science and technology has helped us get here.
And it&amp;rsquo;s worth examining the pros and cons of half-
or fully escaping our tech dependencies,
because &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt; looks different depending on
the biases of who&amp;rsquo;s checking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the physical and digital tools at our disposal
brought about by the advancement of tech
can be used correctly and usefully,
the latter having more meaningful results
while not necessarily efficient all the time.
But whose metric determines the correctness and usefulness
of a piece of tech?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am snapped back to reality
when they announce today&amp;rsquo;s sponsor&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;beach-house-music&#34;&gt;Beach House Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I heard the supposed anthem of Boracay,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfak_vD6K2k&#34;&gt;Ever After (EK Beach Mix) by Bonnie Bailey&lt;/a&gt;,
more than a decade ago,
my teen self felt nostalgic of a white sandy shore I&amp;rsquo;ve never visited
filled with equally white people I&amp;rsquo;ve never met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, beach house muzak renewed something within,
because for me, it does evoke a summery feel,
even when the first week of January gave us nothing
but rains and cold breeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are some recommendations
you can look for in your favorite music streaming platform,
and let me know if you experience something beachy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Song Title&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Artist&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Dove&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Moony&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Pink Life&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Gydkard&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Just the way you are&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Milky&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Be my world&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Milky&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Love generation&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Bob Sinclair&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Make luv&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Room 5&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Happy&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Square Heads&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-life-lessons&#34;&gt;On Life Lessons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were recently sorting out the books in the house
into the following: for sending (to a loved one),
for donation, and for sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, books themselves distracted us
as unfamiliar titles resurface.
So, the task took longer than expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One particular book stood out to me,
because for years I&amp;rsquo;ve been searching for it;
and unknown to me,
I&amp;rsquo;ve been sharing the same space with it for a long while now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is written by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.robertleefulghum.com/&#34;&gt;Robert Fulghum&lt;/a&gt;, called
&lt;em&gt;All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten:
Uncommon Thoughts on Common Things&lt;/em&gt;.
It&amp;rsquo;s a collection of short essays
containing some nuggets of wisdom I haven&amp;rsquo;t read yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to think I can write something similar
when I reach 50 years old,
perhaps a more polished version of my &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt;
but less neodadaistic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What if</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/113/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 28 Dec 2022 05:40:57 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/113/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added new [done] project: &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/nov2022-vlog&#34;&gt;Video Log - Nov 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added 14 new entries and two new one-liners in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited the hardware list in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/support&#34;&gt;Support&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/disclaimer&#34;&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-we-didnt-hear-the-news&#34;&gt;&amp;hellip; we didn&amp;rsquo;t hear the news?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went to family gathering last weekend up in cold Antipolo
during which we had all fun.
People prepared good food for everyone.
One family even brought good coffee to wash the sins away.
And I&amp;rsquo;m all for removing one sin with another caffeinated one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early morning yesterday, one of the attendees informed everyone
that they tested positive for COVID.
The news came as a mild shock, but shocking nonetheless.
If I needed another reminder that COVID is still around,
wait no more, look no further, feel worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had to put off our plans for that day,
and that never feels great
if I&amp;rsquo;m being honest, especially when I&amp;rsquo;m already set to watch
the last gig of Banna Harbera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-we-made-it-to-the-last-banna-gig&#34;&gt;&amp;hellip; we made it to the last Banna gig?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/image/bannaharbera.jpg&#34;
    alt=&#34;promotional poster of Banna Harbera&amp;#39;s final gig last 27 Dec 2022&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Retrieved from their Twitter account @BannaHarbera&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must&amp;rsquo;ve forgotten the feeling of disappointment
when a plan doesn&amp;rsquo;t push through
until yesterday,
when we had to cancel going to the last Banna gig because of the COVID scare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not gonna lie, I&amp;rsquo;m still a bit down today because of missing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if we decided to show up knowing full well that we
had been exposed to at least one COVID-positive person,
it would mean we&amp;rsquo;re reckless and selfish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqUi8YV0_Yw&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;I still dig you&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-the-film-ngayon-kaya-were-executed-better&#34;&gt;&amp;hellip; the film &amp;ldquo;Ngayon Kaya&amp;rdquo; were executed better?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve wondered recently why
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX6pZryBKQY&#34;&gt;Mayonnaise&amp;rsquo;s song &lt;em&gt;Jopay&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
is rising again in popularity.
In a recent office party,
one of the hosts even quipped that
it&amp;rsquo;s the National What-If song,
before the crowd went wild singing it, myself included.
At the time, I didn&amp;rsquo;t get the reference;
none of the song&amp;rsquo;s lyrics, in my opinion, are necessarily about
what-could-have-beens which, I would learn, is what the movie is about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to a week later,
a sibling told me that it likely came from the movie
&lt;em&gt;Ngayon Kaya (Maybe Today)&lt;/em&gt; (2022), directed by Prime Cruz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/image/ngayon-kaya.png&#34;
    alt=&#34;promotional poster of the film Ngayon Kaya last 22 Jun 2022&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Watched this instead of Banna Harbera&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the actors&amp;rsquo; performance don&amp;rsquo;t dip below meh,
the script of tired what-if tropes
limit their potential to give more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, the film could also be a critique on privileged people
risking, and ultimately ruining, other people&amp;rsquo;s lives
for their selfish desires.
To be fair, the film acknowledges this near the end
through one of the characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I give the film a rating of &lt;strong&gt;5.5&lt;/strong&gt;/10,
or &amp;ldquo;Watch only if curious about how this film would
play out, and never again.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Thinking, about Depths, and my Story</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/112/</link>

      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/112/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added 11 new entries and 5 new one-liners to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added &lt;a href=&#34;https://gemmacope.land/&#34;&gt;Gemma&amp;rsquo;s site&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/blogroll&#34;&gt;Blogroll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past few weeks since my last log,
a lot has already happened.
But it&amp;rsquo;s hard to talk about them in public.
It could be that I&amp;rsquo;m always stuck in loops in my head.
When I try to recall them,
the details are hazy,
like it&amp;rsquo;s just a series of big circles linked together,
where the links are even hazier,
but can be detected if you squint hard enough.
The circles, though, seem to have no past;
each just an inifinite present opening and closing in on itself,
until it tangents to another adjacent circle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;out-of-my-depth&#34;&gt;Out of my depth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, right after I woke up, a thought surprised me:
in the event that the car I&amp;rsquo;m in would plunge
into a body of water for whatever reason,
do I just accept my death,
knowing I can&amp;rsquo;t swim?
What a way to die&amp;mdash;to drown in both water and thalassophobia
at the same time, gradually and, I imagine, painfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a distance, I admire mammals like cetaceans.
Deep water is their grace I hope to be in one day.
This world&amp;mdash;this body&amp;mdash;is mostly water.
Why then can&amp;rsquo;t I reconcile the two?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;telling-my-story&#34;&gt;Telling my story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days later, I had another thought, although less pressing:
if I want to preserve my privacy,
whom do I tell my story if I&amp;rsquo;m no longer capable of doing it myself?
Do I even want my story to be told?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My journals and blogs (past, present, future)
are the closest manifestations of my autobiography,
and I&amp;rsquo;m glad I&amp;rsquo;m still writing in them consistently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I select what is and isn&amp;rsquo;t worth sharing,
and the rest&amp;mdash;well, you just have to be there in the flesh
with me to experience the teeter between dullness and excitement,
to witness me strive in and out of the mundane.
And to also fact-check me,
because I&amp;rsquo;m not always the reliable, capable narrator of my own life.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mountains in the Background</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/111/</link>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added 10 new entries and 2 new one-liners to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a week now since we&amp;rsquo;ve arrived from Negros,
back to the cityscape of the dizzying Metro Manila.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t almost notice the difference in the air quality between the two places:
in the suburban of Negros, people burn their dried leaves with the day&amp;rsquo;s trash;
here in Manila, the pollution comes mostly from roaring cars and trucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to Negros&amp;rsquo;s credit, their air is definitely cleaner in general than Manila&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look out the windows, and there&amp;rsquo;s no mountain in the distance.
Unlike in Negros, where Mount Talinis won&amp;rsquo;t ever
offend anyone with its humble beauty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/image/dvn.jpeg&#34;
    alt=&#34;A nipa hut, an EcoSan in the middle of suburban/rural nowhere&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Do you see it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When all your life you&amp;rsquo;ve lived near a mountain,
do you eventually take it for granted?
Do you wake up some days and not notice it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a tourist from Manila,
I nod in awe seeing any mountain looming &lt;em&gt;over there&lt;/em&gt;,
atmoshphere refracting it to a hint bluish haze.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Working for (not as) Art</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/110/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 03 Nov 2022 06:39:14 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/110/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Been staying in Negros Oriental for days now,
here to visit my partner&amp;rsquo;s side of family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What, then, is comfort zone if not the spacetime beyond the
hypercube of home?
I&amp;rsquo;m here to experience another life,
admittedly as a tourist,
outside of Luzon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The house we&amp;rsquo;re in is filled with artworks of artists of varying esteem.
Now and then, I wonder:
how does it feel like to be both artist and art collector?
Too, I asked (whose answer I already know):
does one have to work for art?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After watching a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMJ_kLLgXFM&#34;&gt;video by Van Neistat on art workers&lt;/a&gt;(YouTube),
I was again inspired to create something, anything;
&lt;em&gt;be someone&lt;/em&gt;.
At the same time,
I can&amp;rsquo;t shake off the internal critic that knows any of my output will be crude.
In a society obsessing over details,
almost nobody welcomes with a warm smile a crude output.
And that&amp;rsquo;s pinching me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to romanticize nor glorify
art, work, and the intersection of the two as we know them today.
To be an art worker is a privilege and a burden.
The latter is important to note,
because I&amp;rsquo;d want to work with an artist who shares similar beliefs with me.
Not sure if I know someone in my circle that fits that consideration.
Also, am I ever ready to be a friend&amp;rsquo;s laborer?
I hope so.
Ego gets in the way of meaning,
but if I ever hoped to make this work,
I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t let it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realistically speaking,
this endeavor also means laying the foundations now for &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; artist in the future
to bloom without fear of devolving to obscurity.
As I said, I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t let ego get in the way.
The future artist I&amp;rsquo;m talking about might be &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;,
a future version of myself liberated from today&amp;rsquo;s ills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my shiny new object.
It&amp;rsquo;s timely, I&amp;rsquo;d say,
given my recent facination to physical handtools
and how they can help me make something, anything worth using,
looking at, and/or be around of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personal fears and life circumstances keep me
from creating with my own hands, though.
Because of these,
I question my ability to tap the inner artist.
But &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/88&#34;&gt;there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; an artist in me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time,
my limited exposure to the art world clamps on my vision.
These days, I riff off of some creative&amp;rsquo;s oeuvre,
not because my wits fail me.
Even &lt;a href=&#34;https://austinkleon.com/steal/&#34;&gt;Austin Kleon encourages to not be original&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this to work out in the long run,
I need focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s something relevant:
At work, I haven&amp;rsquo;t been reading every email that gets in my inbox.
Many of them,
even with the rules and configurations I have placed,
are not even for me.
They&amp;rsquo;re in my inbox because I was Cc&amp;rsquo;d at one point,
and not even I cared enough to let the sender know to &amp;ldquo;[p]lease remove me from
thread.&amp;rdquo;
A keybinding will archive any not-for-me messages,
ultimately making it a non-issue for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I think this is the type of focus I want?
I&amp;rsquo;d say it&amp;rsquo;s getting there.
I&amp;rsquo;ve invested time to set up a system that aims to say no on things that don&amp;rsquo;t need my attention.
But more importantly,
I&amp;rsquo;m going to be actively &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/105&#34;&gt;pruning&lt;/a&gt;:
to cut away the excess noise,
to push back on even the great ideas;
all in an effort to work on something that I want to flourish [in].&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Yoga After A Year</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/109/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 Oct 2022 01:59:49 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/109/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been a little over a year now since I started taking yoga seriously.
By which I mean doing it regularly when time and willpower permits.
S convinced me to try it,
and while I was not instantly hooked,
I soon got why it can benefit me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My practice of yoga amounts to several times a week, but not daily, at least not yet.
On average, three times a week.
Some weeks I can do it daily;
some weeks I can only do it on one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what has changed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is, I have not enough data for a meaningful answer.
I only log the duration of each session, in minutes.
With that as my only piece of recorded information,
I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet devised a formula to extract an insight from that data set alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anecdotally, I feel slightly more stoic.
Although it feels off using that word&amp;mdash;&lt;em&gt;stoic&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;as I don&amp;rsquo;t think it necessarily fits what I really feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still experience flare-ups and outbursts,
something I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to manage ever since I was a kid.
If yoga can&amp;mdash;and I think it does&amp;mdash;help my mental wellbeing,
it will take a lot more than just a year of regular practice.&lt;/p&gt;

I know the source of this internal chaos;
in fact, we all know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The little free time I have are spent lazing around with loved ones.
&lt;em&gt;And&lt;/em&gt; deep diving recently to everyday-carry gears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much shiny new stuff to look up,
so little time and money to spend.
I dream of tools dreaming of me.
In reality, my dreams of them slowly crimps me from the outside in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bigger question is:
Do I even need them all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, of course, we know the answer to that:
I don&amp;rsquo;t know when, but when that time comes,
it&amp;rsquo;s certain that I don&amp;rsquo;t have them in my person!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bidet</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/107/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 17 Sep 2022 03:23:34 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/107/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added a link in the Index, explaining what RSS feeds are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added 15 new entries to, and edited the title of, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relocated the search bar to Index.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated some links in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/site&#34;&gt;Site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A co-worker in their boredom sent me a screenshot from Facebook.
It&amp;rsquo;s a post that roughly translates to:
&amp;ldquo;We will be moving to our new office,
but the comfort rooms don&amp;rsquo;t have bidets.
Shall I look for another job?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s funny because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;co-worker said it reminded them of me,
who have preached half-jokingly about the importance of bidets
in all of the out-of-office gatherings that we workmates have had;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the OP&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (of the screenshot) considered (half-jokingly?) that the absence of bidet
in their new office warrants a job hop; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;our office is set to transfer to a new location by end of year,
confirmed to be a bidet non-haver.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t you find it odd that many property owners have the budget
for new buildings, but not for bidets in every water closet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do their managements aim for some green-building certification
by achieving some vague KPI about water conservation?
My friends still working in that industry seem to think so,
but they&amp;rsquo;re not so sure either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I don&amp;rsquo;t think it matters that much.
No building can ever be &amp;ldquo;green.&amp;rdquo;
The moment that its construction begins cuts off its chances at being
sustainable to practically nil.
Might as well be generous and provide some bidets, &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;

      <title>Keeping Safe</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/106/</link>

      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/106/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added 10 new entries and 1 new one-liner to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added some words to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/foss&#34;&gt;FOSS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aesthetic changes to &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; HTML tags.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited some lines in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/bujo&#34;&gt;Bujo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a week it&amp;rsquo;s been.
It started and ended,
as do matches when struck and lit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ignorance-is-bliss&#34;&gt;Ignorance is Bliss?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one is safe from one&amp;rsquo;s own potential for inconsistencies.
As humans with different levels of complexities,
it&amp;rsquo;s no shock that we make wrong moves.
At some point, we have been hypocrites,
whether we recognized it later or not.
I&amp;rsquo;d rather have the self-awareness to detect my falling to fallacies,
than not know and harm myself and those around me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;patience&#34;&gt;Patience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another complicated thing I&amp;rsquo;m still working on: patience.
But as the new trend goes, &amp;ldquo;Questions are the new answers.&amp;rdquo;
Here are some:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do I pause to reflect during the peak of my intense negative emotions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will I always have enough time to think first before impatience becomes
impermanence?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What can I do to keep my community patient?
Should I even meddle with other people&amp;rsquo;s affairs?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;community-intervention&#34;&gt;Community Intervention?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last point in the previous section
is based on a recent incident in our neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the houses from down the street erupted;
two men were shouting at each other,
reaching a crescendo as they stepped out of their house.
We couldn&amp;rsquo;t make out what the contention was,
but we heard the expletives these two adults yelled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they verbally abused one another,
their screams continued to tear through the nearby houses.
Not only did they hurt each other,
they also hurt us, those who were within hearing distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From what we can surmise,
the two men might have some unresolved issues with one another.
I could only imagine the pain they have to endure in living with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this situation, what would you have done?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would have been better if someone trained in dealing
with these kinds of situations was able to intervene and deescalate.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/105/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added a &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/search&#34;&gt;Search&lt;/a&gt; page for this site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added 1 new one-liner and 15 new entries to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited links in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/blogroll&#34;&gt;Blogroll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trimmed the words in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/site&#34;&gt;Site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pruned some lines in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/di-why&#34;&gt;Idea Incubator&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited some lines in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/support&#34;&gt;Support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removed my Notes on Market Research from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/project&#34;&gt;Project List&lt;/a&gt;.
It&amp;rsquo;s been relocated offline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip; and other minor backend changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;no-sooner-than-it-draws-air&#34;&gt;No sooner than it draws air&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;hellip; potential salvation turns it back on nothingness.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me a while to update this space.
Or more accurately,
I never got around to pushing the recent changes to live
until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life gets in the way of creating and destroying things
that are worth writing about.
This has inspired me&amp;mdash;us&amp;mdash;to prune what needs to be pruned.
To let go, one by one, things that no longer matters to us,
even if it takes a while,
even if tests our Patience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I have been writing, analog and offline.
Say what you will about pen and paper,
but it gets the job done seeing on an external object
the thoughts I have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some nights ago,
I had so much brain activity
that I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to waste the thoughts on quickly typing them out
on my computer.
That night, I &amp;ldquo;slowed down&amp;rdquo; and processed each idea,
each memory, through frantic jotting or rappid logging,
whichever fits.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/104/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 22 Aug 2022 08:48:27 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/104/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed a project idea in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/di-why&#34;&gt;list of ideas in incubation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip; and some minor aesthetic edits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-beliefs&#34;&gt;On Beliefs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to talk to friends and family&amp;mdash;at least,
those closest to you&amp;mdash;about things they believe in.
Not only does this open for a lot of interesting discussions,
it also shows how willing you&amp;rsquo;d be to engage in their ideas
that don&amp;rsquo;t necessary align with yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, not everyone has the capacity to hold such space.
This mental bandwidth needs to be acknowledged at all times,
especially when talking about heavy topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, though, it&amp;rsquo;s a great way of knowing the people in your closest circles.
Perhaps in getting to know them deeply,
you get to know more a bit about yourself and your beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gatecrashing-a-party-almost&#34;&gt;Gatecrashing a Party, Almost&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my mother&amp;rsquo;s birthday,
my sibling and a couple of friends and relatives,
decided last minute that we would travel to her to
Guimba, Nueva Ecija,
some ~120 kilometers outside of Metro Manila.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was so sudden,
but since the opportunity presented itself,
our collective consciousness leaned towards going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like seeing the roller-coaster of emotions on my mother&amp;rsquo;s face,
but most of all, I love seeing her happy that we&amp;rsquo;re there for her
on her birthday,
despite the challenges of the commute.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Life Expectancy</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/103/</link>

      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/103/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Closing the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/here&#34;&gt;Knowing Here&lt;/a&gt; project, because honestly, I&amp;rsquo;ve lost
interest in it.
And that&amp;rsquo;s okay&amp;mdash;we should be allowed to shut down small personal projects
without feeling bad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip; and other minor code edits in the background of the frontend,
if you know what I mean.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;thinking-about-the-end&#34;&gt;Thinking about the End&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amid boredom, my mind wandered&amp;mdash;or at least I thought it did&amp;mdash;while
waiting for things at work to pick up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, like most normal people do,
I thought about death.
Or more specifically,
the age I would die,
which I can&amp;rsquo;t know for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would be a worthwhile mental exercise,
I thought, and so I made an armchair research,
and these are my findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;average-life-expectancy-in-the-philippines&#34;&gt;Average Life Expectancy in the Philippines&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of writing this,
the current &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/PHL/philippines/life-expectancy&#34;&gt;life expectancy for Philippines in
2022&lt;/a&gt; is
71.53 years,
a 0.18% increase from the previous year.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The annual rate of increase could be because of a multitude of things,
like improvement of quality of life,
or advancement in medical science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also is likely to vary from year to year,
just like in the historical life expectancy data.
This is what I&amp;rsquo;ll use in my amateur projection of when I might die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;quick-maths&#34;&gt;Quick Maths&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer:
This computation is just quick maths.
I&amp;rsquo;m almost certain that it&amp;rsquo;s not accurate.
This was done only as a low-effort mental exercise.
But feedback, as always, is appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I opened a spreadsheet and plotted the data in a table,
like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th style=&#34;text-align: right&#34;&gt;Year&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th style=&#34;text-align: right&#34;&gt;Growth Rate&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th style=&#34;text-align: right&#34;&gt;Life Expectancy&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: right&#34;&gt;2022&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: right&#34;&gt;0.18%&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: right&#34;&gt;71.53&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: right&#34;&gt;2023&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: right&#34;&gt;0.79%&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: right&#34;&gt;71.659&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: right&#34;&gt;2024&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: right&#34;&gt;0.36%&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: right&#34;&gt;72.225&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: right&#34;&gt;2025&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: right&#34;&gt;1.08%&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: right&#34;&gt;72.485&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Growth Rate column, I used the function &lt;code&gt;RANDBETWEEN&lt;/code&gt;
to get a random value between a range of integers,
and in this case,
0 to 123.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The formula I used for this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;=RANDBETWEEN(0,123)/10000
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or replace &lt;code&gt;(0,123)&lt;/code&gt; with the absolute cell references where
you might place these values, e.g. &lt;code&gt;($E$2,$F$2)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;RANDBETWEEN&lt;/code&gt; function only accepts integers.
So I had to use the values 0 and 123 as the lower and upper limits
respectively,
which will then be divided to 10000 to get the rate in decimal form.
Sure enough, according to the historical data,
there&amp;rsquo;s at least one year when the growth was 1.230%,
while some years there had been no growth at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a screenshot for visuals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/image/life-exp.png&#34;
    alt=&#34;spreadsheet showing life expectancy calculation&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;featuring LibreOffice Calc&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;so-when-do-i-expect-to-die&#34;&gt;So, when do I expect to die?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming I&amp;rsquo;d only last until 72,
that should be around the year 2065.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But by then,
do we expect advances in technology and medicine and whatnot?
If so, I would still expect to live way into my 80s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;afterthought&#34;&gt;Afterthought&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This little exercise can&amp;rsquo;t encompass all the nuances
within the research of life expectancy,
I think that needs to be stated clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn&amp;rsquo;t account all the unforeseen tragedies and comedies of the future
that will likely affect these numbers.
But it&amp;rsquo;s fun running the numbers,
at least for me,
and writing something about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Edited &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/di-why&#34;&gt;the project incubation list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost as if clockwork,
I got my annual flu some time last week,
which lasted a few days and rendered me almost useless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no official diagnosis,
sad to say, because I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the luxury of strength nor resources.
But it felt like common flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also because of the rain.
Southwest monsoon, locally known as &lt;em&gt;habagat&lt;/em&gt;,
partnered with a low-pressure area
has been triggering heavy downpour,
causing floods all over the cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Renamed all the log filenames to increasing positive integers,
starting from 1.
This log would be the 101st.
I realize that this would break some internal links.
I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to rectify that,
but if you see any broken link that&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be linked to a log,
please let me know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added 10 new entries to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated some lines in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/here&#34;&gt;Knowing Here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adage of the Week&lt;/strong&gt;: Your tools will not save you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;more-thoughts-on-linkedin&#34;&gt;More thoughts on LinkedIn&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This short section is an addendum to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/54&#34;&gt;previous post on the same
subject&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When can I permanently log out of LinkedIn?
It&amp;rsquo;s one of those social media sites that I begrudgingly hold on to,
because it was literally my proof of existence when the Immigration
did a background check on me &lt;a href=&#34;https://seekers.araw.xyz/taiwan-part1/&#34;&gt;last time we went to Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually know the answer:
when I no longer need to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;visiting-pagkakaisa-2022&#34;&gt;Visiting Pagkakaisa, 2022&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lola Mila&amp;rsquo;s grand party in Carmona Court had to be postponed,
not only because there&amp;rsquo;s still a COVID pandemic going on,
nor is it because of the growring concern over monkeypox.
No, it&amp;rsquo;s because Lola caught,
for the fourth time,
amoebiasis,
which is said to be common among the elders.
People advised her to rest it out,
and she couldn&amp;rsquo;t agree more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her celebration had to be simplified,
albeit done more, that is, folks celebrated her birthday over
three different days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went on the third day, a Sunday,
a perfect day for cycling,
when motorists with ill intent are not on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a small gathering,
consisting of three chainsmokers,
one of whom is the celebrant herself.
It can be a dizzying experience for an ex-smoker like me,
but isn&amp;rsquo;t life a long list of compromises?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My round trip totaled ~22 kilometers,
a good exercise riding fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Edited some lines in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/bujo&#34;&gt;Bujo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added some lines in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/foss&#34;&gt;FOSS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like so many people,
I&amp;rsquo;m not fond of hearing a recording of my voice.
How I sound when heard from a digital&amp;mdash;and I suspect, analog, too&amp;mdash;is
very different in terms of its impact to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people say it has something to do with the resonance of the skull
that makes one&amp;rsquo;s own voice sound different to an external body.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Age of Quick Clicks and Wits</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/99/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 21 Jul 2022 12:01:14 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/99/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the age of perma-online presence,
it&amp;rsquo;s worth considering to think before you click.
With attention being one of the main currencies of capital-I Internet,
whoever has the quickest wit and/or the snarkiest comeback
that elicits something&amp;mdash;any strong emotion really&amp;mdash;reaches the top.
Whatever that top is, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing wrong with wanting to perform for an audience
every now and then.
The Internet, however, is a platform where it gets real sticky real quick.
Before expressing any unfiltered thoughts,
one has to pay attention to what one would dump to the virtual permanence of the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, some part of me has always been curious about Comedy
as the combination of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;humor as a lens through which the society can be observed;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a practice to keep the mind sharp; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an act of distilling the human experience, self-expressed and performed wearing a mask.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be funny is tricky;
to keep it fun and engaging, even more so,
because it&amp;rsquo;s not without consequences, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To mitigate the effects of the growing list of future regrets,
I do two things before saying something (what I think is)
clever in online spaces:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I type it out.&lt;/strong&gt; For me, this conversion of thoughts from analog to digital
via mechanical motions allows me to add buffer to the excitement. Doing so
addresses the question, &amp;ldquo;Is it worth typing it out?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I read it out loud&lt;/strong&gt;, if/when I can. How does it sound? I imagine saying it
in person with the intended recipients just within arms reach. How do I think
would they react when they hear it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with all things in life, it remains a field of compromises.
Lately, though, I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to temper my tendencies to blurt out edgy
things,
even around people who already know my kind of humor.
I write it here so I can keep myself accountable.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Week 28 of 2022</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/98/</link>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actually added this site&amp;rsquo;s onion address at the footer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated the server, from Debian 10 (Buster) to 11 (Bullseye).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tinkering with life&amp;mdash;and sometimes, interesting things happen around me.
Which breed interesting musings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;card-games&#34;&gt;Card games&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last few days had me wanting to play
&lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/donsol.html&#34;&gt;Donsol&lt;/a&gt;,
a dungeon-crawler card game designed by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/johneternal&#34;&gt;John
Eternal&lt;/a&gt;.
The game utilizes the standard 54 cards, including jokers.
Lacking the physical deck, though, I played it online.
I think there&amp;rsquo;s a downloadable version for smartphones,
but I suspect it&amp;rsquo;s paid?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this game inspred me to &lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt; and design a game using this standard
deck.
Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m considering Apocalypse as the main theme of this would-be game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;vermin&#34;&gt;Vermin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In dawns where faint light outside creeps in to activate my body,
the distant squeaks of vermins from the night before morph into tweets of local
aviary in the morning.
This transition is seamless, and every time, my sleepy self can&amp;rsquo;t tell when the
change of guards happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These mice, rats&amp;mdash;their presence is a symptom of something larger than us.
We&amp;rsquo;ve only begun addressing this issue &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; recently,
and I must tell,
feelings have been overwhelming, to say the least!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;convenience-vs-resilience&#34;&gt;Convenience vs Resilience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all try to go through life teetering between these two.
In my opinion, though, we need to normalize living simply&amp;mdash;meaning,
learning how to give up some convenience (if not most of it!)
so that others may simply live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process, when done right, would also make us resilent.
Not to romanticize resilience,
but isn&amp;rsquo;t that something worth striving for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;monster-quiz&#34;&gt;Monster Quiz&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&#34;https://chigby.org/quiz/&#34;&gt;https://chigby.org/quiz/&lt;/a&gt;:
I&amp;rsquo;m an Ouroboros quiz&amp;hellip;
of neither beginning nor end, that eats its own tail,
the one with no results&amp;hellip;
Repetition turns to habit turns to necessity.
Questions become scales
and eyes teeth forever gnawing in autocannibalism.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This site is now available as an onion site.
Visit the ff. in Tor Browser:

&lt;li&gt;Updated &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/di-why&#34;&gt;list of future projects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated the Preface  of &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt;.
FKA as Foreword, which I recently found out that I misused;
Preface is more apt since it&amp;rsquo;s written by the author (me).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/blogroll&#34;&gt;Blogroll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jidoka (自働化), or automation with human touch,
is typically associated with lean manufacturing.
It allows the machine operator to stop the flow line
so that defective pieces will not move to the next station
until the problem is fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can this principle be used within the confines of human mind,
as in when one imagines new infinities out of boredom?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imagine; therefore, it&amp;rsquo;s possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much can be said about automating stuff nowadays.
When it comes to machines, it means speeding up the task
while producing consistent output.
Applied to the fleshy psyche, though&amp;hellip; now, &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; can be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t see me succumbing to the less obvious disintegration
of internal pipes as they burst with rising pressure.
The implosion is contained,
and most likely, has no lasting dread.
That&amp;rsquo;s to say,
I will continue curating ideas as they come to me,
and I to them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A fairly recent post over at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://seekers.araw.xyz/outforsweets/&#34;&gt;Araw
Seekers&lt;/a&gt; about our visit to a nearby zero-waste store.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New favicon for this site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited some lines in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/feb2022-photos&#34;&gt;Feb 2022 Photo Dump&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited some sections on &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/site&#34;&gt;Site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/blogroll&#34;&gt;Blogroll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added 10 new entries and 2 new one-liners to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this part 2 of me subtly complaining about how unbelievable it is we&amp;rsquo;re
already halfway through the year 2022&amp;hellip; (Read &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/half2022&#34;&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June 2022 is one of those slow months, I think.
It could be because no one dares to believe that we&amp;rsquo;re already six months in.
The harder and longer one thinks about it, the more distorted one&amp;rsquo;s perception
of current time becomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruckus of the recent national elections has legally placed another Marcos in
the highest seat in the Philippine state.
In the next few days, he will be officially our new president for the next six
years.
I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine those next six years would be any better than the last six.
Let&amp;rsquo;s not even pretend that we still have a chance of a better future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have never been a betting man.
That&amp;rsquo;s why I won&amp;rsquo;t gamble my hopes on this fantasy of mine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone now pays attention.
To June, to the so-called Gemini season, and to the months that come after.
People are more thoughtful of their actions.
And this collective mindfulness somehow affected the rate at which time passes.
We now observe Life, live in it, here and now&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I wish!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Las Casas Filipinas de Acuzar</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/95/</link>

      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/95/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed one minor detail where our north is, in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/here&#34;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As cringey as it sounds,
never think blogging as complete without a blogger&amp;rsquo;s review of
an out-of-town destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post,
I&amp;rsquo;m going to give my thoughts on
Las Casas Filipinas de Acuzar in Bagac, Bataan.
All expenses paid by my employer in the guise of company outing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;first-impressions&#34;&gt;First Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a tourist destination with a hefty price,
it&amp;rsquo;s not looking good.
Literally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unpaved road leading to the compound lends for a bumpy ride.
It isn&amp;rsquo;t too farfetched to think that this becomes worse with puddles if/when
it&amp;rsquo;s raining.
Definitely not for most people.
Maybe this, too, is intended as part of
the 19th century feel of Old Manila?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check-in is meh.
Many of the reviews in the internet seem
to think it&amp;rsquo;s bad, though.
Maybe we&amp;rsquo;re just lucky that day,
or maybe I had already lowered my expectations at that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;facilities&#34;&gt;Facilities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we reach our rooms,
we&amp;rsquo;re promised to have our own toiletries,
pairs of slippers,
and at least one bottle of water per person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we got in,
we discovered there were no towels,
no slippers,
and no bottles of water.
We had to call the reception for towels and water multiple times.
If love motels can provide it by default&amp;mdash;as per my friends &lt;em&gt;*wink*&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;then
why can&amp;rsquo;t this pricey resort?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The split-type aircon unit leaked,
creating an unpleasant puddle.
Supposedly there&amp;rsquo;s a water heater,
but all we got was cold shower.
There&amp;rsquo;s an electric kettle,
but I&amp;rsquo;m sure they don&amp;rsquo;t expect us to use that
as our water heater, right?
Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All roads are made of cobblestone.
Depending on one&amp;rsquo;s preference,
it may or may not be okay to walk on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some modes of getting around include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tram that runs as fast a walking person;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;calesa&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;jeepney&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my knowledge, only the tram is free of charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a mythical bike rental shop,
but I never got around to locating it,
nor would I have had the energy to cycle around knowing roads&#39;
unevenness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/image/bicuzar.jpeg&#34;
    alt=&#34;A small green vintage bike hanging on a wall&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;All I got is a picture of this&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;food&#34;&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffet food, not good.
Most were bland:
pieces of meat with uneventful releases
of unsavory liquid when bitten.
Some I did like, but overall, I&amp;rsquo;ve had better meals from a local carinderia near our home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s like seasoning was never part of the menu.
Only the speculative feeling of taste that the diner had to imagine,
just so they could finish the food,
and honor the lives that were sacrificed to feed them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;beach&#34;&gt;Beach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sea did look inviting,
in spite of the grey sand one has to cross first
before reaching the saltwater.
This one definitely felt better than the shores
of &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/calatagan&#34;&gt;Calatagan&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;smooth sand sans jagged stones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, we played [with] the waves,
even dared chasing them.
The waves were game.
It was only when the sun was setting when the waves were getting
larger and increasingly frequent&amp;mdash;as
if to push us back to the shore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;miscellaneous&#34;&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a pool area,
which I don&amp;rsquo;t recommend,
simply because the beach must be the obvious choice
of body of water for one to swim in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They offered a walking tour
where the guide would invite the guests to go inside
at least three of the old houses,
which I had no interest in participating,
because they timed it during the hottest part of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;verdict&#34;&gt;Verdict&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only go there if someone whose net worth is at least five times as much as yours sponsors your trip.
Don&amp;rsquo;t spend your own hard-earned money to spend even a day there.
There are better places to be in!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>&#39;It&#39;s already half of the year!&#39;</title>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refreshed the &lt;a href=&#34;https://seekers.araw.xyz&#34;&gt;Araw Seekers&lt;/a&gt; look,
complete with new URL!
No new post yet,
but soon there might be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most days I get out of work tired and/or drained
(what&amp;rsquo;s the difference again?),
leaving little energy for things I want to do,
like maybe updating this corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My supposed &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/here&#34;&gt;project of the month for May&lt;/a&gt; has been pushed back
indefinitely until I bounce back from my (metaphorical) vegetative state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now&amp;mdash;it&amp;rsquo;s already&amp;hellip; June?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let&amp;rsquo;s talk a bit about work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;80-rto&#34;&gt;80% RTO&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I&amp;rsquo;ve been employed last Aug 2021,
I mostly work from home.
That changed on the 3rd week of May 2022,
when we had to report to office for 4 days a week
for two weeks.
This is because some important person from abroad
would visit our office to conduct trainings and workshops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s just say most of my team mates,
myself included,
are not fond of going back to office.
And that&amp;rsquo;s all I&amp;rsquo;m going to say about it
lest my employer&amp;mdash;bless them please&amp;mdash;do
something about their employee ranting vaguely on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Loud Thuds In The Night</title>

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quality sleeps are far and few in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep hearing loud thuds in the middle of the night.
Sometimes, it&amp;rsquo;s the neighborhood cats jumping onto the hollow roofings.
Sometimes, it&amp;rsquo;s duhats (&lt;em&gt;Syzygium cumini&lt;/em&gt;) rainfalling from the backyard tree.
In any case,
the thuds agitate the dog,
sending him into barking spree&amp;mdash;in the middle of the night,
mind you&amp;mdash;until he is satisfied that there is no danger at all&amp;hellip;
until the next loud thud, that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, it&amp;rsquo;s me that the loud thuds agitate.
There were nights that I imagined that someone could be lurking
above us,
waiting to burglarize our home,
if it weren&amp;rsquo;t for the misplaced step that revealed their presence.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added one section for &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/here&#34;&gt;Knowing Here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added 10 new entries to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pop music is as perennial as grass.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
And like grass, it&amp;rsquo;s there for a reason.
Whether we know this reason doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter in the grand scheme of
things.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
No matter what your music preference is,
pop music will always find its way on your radar.
Tempting you with its catchy tunes and overuse of millenial whoops and hey&amp;rsquo;s.
Might as well find it in you the willingness to experience them,
not just to tolerate their existence,
but to enjoy them, if only for a little while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing prompt: use &amp;ldquo;as perennial as grass&amp;rdquo; in your next writing, like
every other legit writer out there.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another prompt: use &amp;ldquo;grand scheme of things.&amp;rdquo;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/91/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited a few lines in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/support&#34;&gt;Support&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added a new project for the month of May 2022: &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/here&#34;&gt;Knowing Here&lt;/a&gt;.
This is my attempt to know more about the space I&amp;rsquo;ll be living in for the
foreseeable future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added some recommendations for &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/dada&#34;&gt;Dada&lt;/a&gt;,
in case anyone is interested to pick it up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added 6 new entries and 1 new one-liner for &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-helping-strangers&#34;&gt;On Helping Strangers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If and when you can, help strangers.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
Even if it&amp;rsquo;s for &amp;ldquo;selfish&amp;rdquo; reason
(&amp;ldquo;I feel good helping them&amp;rdquo;),
or selfless (&amp;ldquo;I hope they feel good&amp;rdquo;),
it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter.
It nets positive in any case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Isya and I helped a kid fix the flat tire of his BMX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this afternoon, we met a woman having trouble figuring out how to fold
a foldable platform trolley.
I taught her how:
step on the rod (spring-loaded) that&amp;rsquo;s on the bottom edge of the handle.
This disengages the lock,
allowing the handle to fold onto the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, always ask first if they need and/or want help.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Missing e</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/90/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 22 Apr 2022 06:43:35 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/90/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Table of Contents in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/project&#34;&gt;Projects&lt;/a&gt; is now compressed in &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;detail&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag,
so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t take unnecessary space unless expanded by the reader.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited some lines in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/foss&#34;&gt;FOSS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added 1 new entry to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shitposting and nightblogging are terms whose meaning I first found in Tumblr.
Specifically in this &lt;a href=&#34;https://uppercasesmileyface.com/post/126760632305/honeywaspkittenbaby-upthawolfs/amp&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;.
In summary:
Nightblogging is Surrealism&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;;
Shitposting is Dada&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, I did shitpost, because at the time it made sense.
Not making sense made sense, I mean, in the current crises that we&amp;rsquo;re in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, I also nightblogged, sharing pseudo-intellectual musings to strangers
of similar wavelength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, I&amp;rsquo;ll do both here in this post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shitpost&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;em&gt;A void is a must try at all cost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nightblog&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;em&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s odd that I like some skin more so than others.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title of this post is inspired by a browser extension for Tumblr from wayback when.
Power users would have &lt;a href=&#34;https://missing-e.tumblr.com&#34;&gt;Missing e&lt;/a&gt;,
because Tumblr had&amp;mdash;and, I think,
still has&amp;mdash;been making poor UI/UX design choices.
Missing e put back the features that the @staff removed,
and/or placed something that would drastically improve the blogging experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, I had been on that site,
more than any other social networking platforms.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t like the shortness and urgency of Twitter,
although people leveraged the 140-char limit at the time
to produce witty and digestible sound bites.
Nor did I like Facebook,
for the sole reason that people there know me.
I couldn&amp;rsquo;t have them not care about my shitposts and nightblogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw the balance I needed in Tumblr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, below are &amp;ldquo;reblogs&amp;rdquo; from a few Tumblr users.
Which one is a shitpost?
Which one is a nightblog?
Can either be both?
Or is each neither?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;https://post-wars.tumblr.com/post/680303963701149696&#34;&gt;vernon&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Filipino word &lt;em&gt;papak&lt;/em&gt; is very specific, ano?
I don’t know if other languages also have a term for eating without rice.
The Japanese has the synecdoche 御飯 (gohan)
while Korean and Bahasa have 밥 (bap) and &lt;em&gt;nasi&lt;/em&gt; respectively,
but how do we say we eat a meal without the essential component of it that makes it a meal in our cultures?
The invite-question 밥 먹었 니?
(have you eaten?)
may mean different if we take out the 밥 component,
implying either a snacktime or that, perhaps, they are what we would say, &lt;em&gt;pumapapak&lt;/em&gt;.
“A meal is not a meal without rice”
is something a person from Maritime Southeast Asia would say.
What will you &lt;em&gt;goreng&lt;/em&gt; if there’s no &lt;em&gt;nasi&lt;/em&gt; in nasi goreng?
Maybe &lt;em&gt;mie&lt;/em&gt;?
But is &lt;em&gt;mie&lt;/em&gt; goreng a &lt;em&gt;meal&lt;/em&gt; meal?
Put in a cup of rice.
Indonesians and Filipinos would gladly eat carbs with carbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Makan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;http://jncos.tumblr.com/post/169958561206/three-men-met-upon-the-luncheon-table-and&#34;&gt;jncos&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three men met upon the luncheon table and discussed what they were going to eat for their meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The youth said “&lt;em&gt;I will use some money to order an avocado using an app on my phone, for although it is pricey I find this to be both efficient and delicious.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientist said “&lt;em&gt;I will order some Soylent using my cryptocurrency, for although this is even more pricey and disgusting from both a taste and conceptual standpoint I believe you will find this to be even more efficient that ordering an avocado.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The master clapped his hands and recited: “&lt;em&gt;My jaws are now open/ my gullet is red. From the wise mother owl/ I shall always stay fed.&lt;/em&gt;” and opened his mouth towards the sky. The others beheld this and understood the true way.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Grand Boulevard Hotel</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/89/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 10 Apr 2022 16:58:06 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/89/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Surfaced from the Drafts what I consider now a dead project before it even
lived: &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/dada&#34;&gt;Dada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added 6 new entries and 3 new one-liners to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remembered the Grand Boulevard Hotel along Roxas Boulevard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a cousin&amp;rsquo;s birthday,
and her father wanted to celebrate in a hotel.
Back then, as an 8-9 year-old,
I thought it was an exciting venue to be in.
Looking back at it now,
I think it was a waste of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember still the building had a brutalist facade,
although I didn&amp;rsquo;t know then what a brutalist design was,
nor did I appreciate it.
The building looked stiff enough in its greyness and roughness,
and that was it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember the swimming pool to be in the third floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point,
one of the elevators stopped working.
I vaguely remember that it was my cousin&amp;rsquo;s fault,
her being unneccessarily playful with the buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time then spoke highly of Nokia mobile phones
that had the game Snake 2 on them.
What a time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Artiste</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/88/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 05 Apr 2022 12:55:13 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/88/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s only recently that I&amp;rsquo;ve realized this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; an artist in me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For so long, I had dismissed any attempts at being visually creative.
The usual excuse: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not talented enough to draw,&amp;rdquo; or
&amp;ldquo;No one in the family is good at art,&amp;rdquo; or
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not really an artistic person.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; an artistic person &amp;mdash; at least in my own amateur, non-profit way.
I have always expressed myself through the literary arts&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
A different medium, a different approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to visual arts,
my excuses only vexxed me in this toxic feedback loop of stagnating,
never creating, never expressing.
How did that go?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently saw &lt;a href=&#34;https://haring.com&#34;&gt;Keith Haring&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s art for the first time a few
weeks ago.
And all of this hit me in a strange but good way.
It&amp;rsquo;s likely because, in my humble opinion,
there&amp;rsquo;s a bit of semblance or style between his drawings and &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/85/#on-doodling&#34;&gt;my doodling&lt;/a&gt;.
His art looks simple,
but we all know that there&amp;rsquo;s more subtance to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It would take some time to un-feel my annoyance towards the color teal,
however objectively cool it looks.
The reason for that is,
we&amp;rsquo;ve just moved out of an apartment complex
whose indoor and outdoor walls are in that color &lt;em&gt;all through out&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need visuals, look at the photos of Day 1 &amp;ndash; 3 &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/feb2022-photos&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine living in it for some two to three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we&amp;rsquo;re back to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/feb2022-photos/#day-19&#34;&gt;old house&lt;/a&gt;,
back to the heart of a city,
where it&amp;rsquo;s nice and quiet,
apart from the campaign jingles of numerous candidates running for office.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added 9 new entries and 4 new one-liners in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other very minor aesthetic updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;now-as-predicted&#34;&gt;Now, as predicted&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/david-byrne-predicted-the-future-life-during-wartime/&#34;&gt;David Byrne told NME in 1979&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be chronic food shortages
and gas shortages and people will live in hovels.
Paradoxically, they&amp;rsquo;ll be surrounded by computers
the size of wrist watches.
Calculators will be cheap.
It&amp;rsquo;ll be as easy to hook up your computer with a central television bank as it is to get the week&amp;rsquo;s groceries.
I think we&amp;rsquo;ll be cushioned by amazing technological development and sitting on Salvation Army furniture.
Everything else will be crumbling.
Government surveillance becomes inevitable because there&amp;rsquo;s this dilemma when you have an increase in information storage.
A lot of it is for your convenience - but as more information gets on file it&amp;rsquo;s bound to be misused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-liminality&#34;&gt;On liminality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering my weird disposition to many aspects of life,
I might be a liminal character in someone&amp;rsquo;s major story arc.
I maintain the entropy by exerting the minimum effort possible
in a given situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has become more obvious recently,
when my co-workers and I showed up at the office
for the first time since the Pandemic started,
and first time this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot in that space distracted me,
but I managed to keep it cool for the entire day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway&amp;mdash;at least once I&amp;rsquo;ve been called &lt;em&gt;edgy&lt;/em&gt;.
I denied this, of course.
The accuser likely misunderstood the combination
of my niche idealism politics and healthy dose of dark humor
to be &amp;ldquo;edgy&amp;rdquo; in the most Gen Z sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say this because,
the totality of my beliefs,
from what I know so far,
is in the minority.
This makes fitting to a space not easy,
but always worth the (t/w)ry.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Updates from Near Future</title>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/project&#34;&gt;Projects&lt;/a&gt; come with two new design updates:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project status is now a visible bar at the beginning of the post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Table of Contents now come after the first section (introduction).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added new lines on my &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/mr&#34;&gt;MR Notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added 9 new entries to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited some sections in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/foss&#34;&gt;FOSS&lt;/a&gt;.
Spoiler: I moved away from Firefox, but not quite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grammar edit on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/old-computer&#34;&gt;Old Computer Challenge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-being-calm&#34;&gt;On being calm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to remain calm under intense pressure can be a superpower.
In agitation,
we tend to lose some of our mental faculties.
Not so much when we remain calm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in an ever-changing world,
in which we&amp;rsquo;re becoming more aware of the injustices done to us
by different forces,
directly or indirectly,
we have to ask ourselves,
&amp;ldquo;Can we remain calm despite all this?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have we considered that perhaps this ability comes with privilege?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-being-a-web-developer&#34;&gt;On being a web developer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an imaginary near future,
I&amp;rsquo;d have decided to be a web developer for individuals and/or small entities.
It would be my side hustle,
minus the backbreaking demand of side hustles these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The caveat is that,
I would only design websites with very low carbon footprint.
This likely means most of them would be static websites,
and/or would at least qualify to be under the &lt;a href=&#34;https://1mb.club&#34;&gt;1MB Club&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would be the services I&amp;rsquo;d offer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;One-time Setup&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;I would design and set up their website,
after which I would hand them all the code, documentation, and licensing to it.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Coaching on Site Maintenance&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;I would walk them through basic site maintenance,
for &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; number of sessions.
Copy of documentation included.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Your Own Webmaster&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;I would be your own webmaster.
I would be responsible in maintaining your site&amp;rsquo;s uptime.
If you want to add new page/s,
I&amp;rsquo;d set it up.
Limited slots only.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have never been a freelancer my whole life,
so any suggestions on this would be appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-doodling&#34;&gt;On doodling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the benefits&amp;mdash;among many &lt;em&gt;ofc!&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;of work-from-home setup
is I get to doodle during meetings that I don&amp;rsquo;t facilitate myself.
I use the term &lt;em&gt;doodle&lt;/em&gt;,
because it&amp;rsquo;s how I&amp;rsquo;d describe random squiggly lines
that are neither fractal nor meaningful in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doodling actually lets me focus on the discussions in boring meetings.
Most meetings are boring, by the way,
including those that I run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine doodling in face-to-face meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I won&amp;rsquo;t be imagining for long.
We are required to come to office soon,
so I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to test this one out in front of my colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dogs Barking So Much</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/84/</link>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This whole site is now in Dark mode by default.
Added a section about this on &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/site&#34;&gt;Colophon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minor edit on some word in Index.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added new things in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/support&#34;&gt;Support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minor edit on some wordings on &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/feb2022-photos&#34;&gt;Feb 2022 Photos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added new things I&amp;rsquo;m considering in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/foss&#34;&gt;FOSS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added and removed links to and from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/blogroll&#34;&gt;Blogroll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited some lines in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/bujo&#34;&gt;Bujo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minor edit in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/disclaimer&#34;&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All around us,
here in our current apartment,
dogs bark and curb excessively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we expect them to bark,
being dogs that they are,
some of them,
especially those in households adjacent to us,
do it so much that we looked into it ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick search on &lt;a href=&#34;https://pets.webmd.com/dogs/guide/understanding-why-dogs-bark&#34;&gt;Pets WebMD&lt;/a&gt; verified our observations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dogs in our immediate vicinity excessively bark because of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;boredom/loneliness
(most of them are left alone in the house for long periods of time)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;attention seeking (most of them are kept outdoors,
away from the only live interaction they have)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;anxiety (some of them are hyper-attached to their humans,
and get anxious when left alone)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t claim to be dog whisperers.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/feb2022-photos/#day-17&#34;&gt;Pablo&lt;/a&gt;, our dog,
sometimes can be just too much to handle.
But at least we make a regular effort to walk him.
Playing with him is effortless,
as he shares the indoor spaces with us.
As a bonus,
he has &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/feb2022-photos/#day-3&#34;&gt;Edgar&lt;/a&gt; to play with when we&amp;rsquo;re busy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dogs need to expend their energy;
more so for the breeds that have so much of them.
A tired dog is a quiet dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re thinking of getting a dog,
please consider your own capacity to regularly engage with it,
and/or adopt one that matches your energy and lifestyle.
Doing so also saves your neighbors the headache.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Emotions, pt. 2</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/83/</link>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wrapped up the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/feb2022-photos&#34;&gt;Daily Photos - Feb 2022&lt;/a&gt; by adding one last
photo, and adding a section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it really okay to tell someone
&amp;ldquo;We shouldn&amp;rsquo;t let our emotions get into this&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As humans, it&amp;rsquo;s only natural to experience emotions,
to be overwhelmed by them in overwhelming times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What isn&amp;rsquo;t okay is for us to let &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; our emotions run our lives.
And that&amp;rsquo;s a different thing altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minor change in colors for dark mode, for a slightly better contrast between
text and background color.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added 7 new photos to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/feb2022-photos&#34;&gt;Daily Photos - Feb 2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added 10 new entries and 1 new one-liner for &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another add-on to my Firefox browser, over at &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/foss&#34;&gt;FOSS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited footer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added a new section, Privacy, to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/site&#34;&gt;Colophon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several years ago,
it did baffle me how senior citizens feel when they feel excruciating pain on
their hips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Does it really go that bad to require hip replacement operation?&amp;rdquo;
my former foolishness asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failing to imagine that might have you attributing it
to a deadly combo of my youthful ignorance and ageism tendency at the time,
but it really was beyond me to think how painful it is
on a region that&amp;rsquo;s fairly safe to move around (according to me).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pain on my left hip and/or left pelvis
(I really don&amp;rsquo;t know which,
but in that zone)
has been nagging me for weeks now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t pinpoint now when it exactly started, or how.
Perhaps, it&amp;rsquo;s the result of long hours of sitting due to knowledge work,
and improperly doing some yoga poses (?),
both of which started between Q3 &amp;amp; Q4 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to me who has no professional medical expertise,
has not sought professional medical care,
and has not even researched on the topic yet,
it&amp;rsquo;s not &lt;em&gt;yet&lt;/em&gt; debilitating,
and that&amp;rsquo;s why I can still tolerate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now having experienced what I imagine is just a fraction of a fraction of the pain of what those people that need hip replacement feel,
I&amp;rsquo;m slightly ever closer to understanding
what life would become for me if I continue to neglect my body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Moved my only contact detail to the perennial footer.
Rearranged the details on the footer as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added 5 new entries and 1 new one-liner to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effects of regional language differences always interest me.
Recent example was from an online meeting at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Filipino and Indian colleagues came to discussing our top three goals
for the year 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Naresh&amp;rdquo; (not their real name) from Hyderabad said the usual: more travel, better health, and &lt;em&gt;hike&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The facilitator, wanting some small talk, asked (non-verbatim), &amp;ldquo;Oh, which mountains are you planning to hike on?
Are there mountains in India?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Venky&amp;rdquo; (also not their real name) spoke in behalf of Naresh.
&amp;ldquo;Actually, Naresh meant salary increase when they said &lt;em&gt;hike&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The facilitator, slightly embarassed, laughed it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.sahilister.in&#34;&gt;Sahil&lt;/a&gt; confirmed on an email exchange that, yes,
&amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;hike&lt;/em&gt; [is] usually short [for] &amp;lsquo;salary hike&amp;rsquo; here in corporate India.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minor visual design change in which the lists of pages, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/log&#34;&gt;Log&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/project&#34;&gt;Projects&lt;/a&gt;, look tighter now, literally.
On Log, dates now follow ISO 8601 format, i.e., &lt;code&gt;yyyy-mm-dd&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added a section in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/site&#34;&gt;Colophon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added 9 new entries and 2 new one-liners in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added 7 new photos in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/feb2022-photos&#34;&gt;Daily Photos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-machine-consciousness&#34;&gt;On Machine Consciousness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manuel DeLanda, in &lt;em&gt;War in the Age of Intelligent Machines&lt;/em&gt; (1991) believes that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans didn&amp;rsquo;t really invent machines. A hurricane is a motor in the
literal sense. When a hurricane is born, a lot of self-organizing
processes are involved that bring the heat from the outside and
concentrate it in a reservoir. It took centuries before humans
discovered the motor, something that self-assembles spontaneously in
nature. As soon as you let matter and energy in any form flow in a
non-linear manner (that is, past a certain threshold of complexity)
machines will tend to spontaneously self-assemble. The key word here
is &amp;rsquo;non-linear&#39;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike social constructivism which achieves openness by making the
world depend on human interpretation, Deleuze achieves it by making
the world into a creative, complexifying and problematizing cauldron
of becoming. Because of their anthropocentrism constructivist
philosophies remain prisoners of what Foucault called &amp;rsquo;the episteme of
man,&amp;rsquo; while Deleuze plunges ahead into a post-humanist future: In
which the world has been enriched by a multiplicity of non-human
agencies. And in contrast to other materialistic or realistic
philosophies of the past. The key non-human agency in Deleuzian
philosophy has nothing to do with the negative, with oppositions or
contradictions but with pure, productive, positive difference. It is
ultimately this positive difference, and its affirmation in thought,
that insures the openness of the world&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, that&amp;rsquo;s a lot to take in.
Keeping it here so I can come back to it,
in case I need to be grounded to&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-my-heavy-metal-phase&#34;&gt;On my heavy metal phase&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The part 2 of the final season of &lt;em&gt;Attach on Titan&lt;/em&gt; is now out on Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hype is real, of course.
It helps that the opening song is &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/qpHvj5pvvhg&#34;&gt;The Rumbling by SiM&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This made me think about how I feel about heavy metal as a music genre in
general.
I thought I was already past it, with growing up and old and all that.
It turns out that while I was never fully immersed in it,
part of me that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; in it, never really left it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never understood the growling and screaming then.
Now, if/when I like a heavy metal song,
it&amp;rsquo;s one of the things I look forward to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My brother taught me how to be a part-time metalhead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Minor edit to some lines in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/site&#34;&gt;Site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added three new photos to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/feb2022-photos&#34;&gt;Daily Photos - Feb 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added five new entries to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited some line in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/support&#34;&gt;Support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;Even&lt;/del&gt; Especially as an adult,
dealing with one&amp;rsquo;s own emotions is difficult.
We expect an adult to be capable of handling them in a mature way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, really, what is the mature way if not the less destructive,
less toxic version of what might have been?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s contemplate as I type this:
recent emotions messed up joint/s in my right wrist again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Edit some lines in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/site&#34;&gt;Colophon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added a photo to &lt;a href=&#34;feb2022-photos&#34;&gt;Daily Photos - Feb 2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woke up early,
expecting to start the day right,
only to come to an air polluted by open burning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s not right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;clean-air-act&#34;&gt;Clean Air Act?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All potential sources of air pollution (mobile, point and area sources) must comply with the provisions of the law. All emissions must be within the air quality standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobile sources refer to vehicles like cars, trucks, buses, jeepneys, tricycles, motorcycles, and vans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Point sources refer to stationary sources such as industrial firms and the smokestacks of power plants, hotels, and other establishments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Area sources refer to sources of emissions other than the above. These include smoking, burning of garbage, and dust from construction, unpaved grounds, etc.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;waste-management&#34;&gt;Waste Management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to enforce this when people are not empowered to do
something about, say, preserving the environment;
or&amp;mdash;I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;mdash;have the basic decency to not pollute the neighbor&amp;rsquo;s
breathing air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waste management is still an underrated topic in many developing nations.
One would think this is such an obvious&amp;mdash;basic, even&amp;mdash;problem to tackle,
but it quickly becomes complex when we factor in the public&amp;rsquo;s disinterest
and lack of sense of urgency.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added BPI QR code as a means to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/support&#34;&gt;Support&lt;/a&gt; me if you&amp;rsquo;re from
around here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added six new entries and one new one-liner to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added new project: &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/feb2022-photos&#34;&gt;Daily Photos - Feb 2022&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s my attempt
to be more visually creative, at least for a month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few months of semi-regular viewing,
we&amp;rsquo;ve finished watching &lt;em&gt;Mr. Robot&lt;/em&gt; series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a lot to take in.
As with most series we consume,
we try not to binge-watch it,
and try to process each episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I also try to watch one series at any given time.
This is especially a good thing to do, in my opinion, for &lt;em&gt;Mr. Robot&lt;/em&gt;,
because it deals with heavy topics.
And I don&amp;rsquo;t want to muddy my thinking by watching other series
alongside it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, it&amp;rsquo;s a great series&amp;mdash;mind-bending as a
techno-thriller should!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed typo in the last log.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added a new section to a log from last year, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/12&#34;&gt;the music that reminds me of
that time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deleted an item from &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/support&#34;&gt;Support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the aesthetic side of things, I updated the color of &lt;code&gt;a:hover&lt;/code&gt; (link hover) from
&lt;code&gt;#69bb69&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;#36ca5c&lt;/code&gt;. A slightly more vibrant apple green, if you know what
I mean.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added three new entries and two new one-liners to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if to respond to my whining yesterday,
it rained today for the most part of the daytime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kind of rain that both releases the heat trapped beneath the earth,
and keeps them in the air long enough to cause some mild annoyances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And still, in act of defying discomfort by merely existing,
I try to tell myself: I&amp;rsquo;m exactly where I need to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen it yet, there&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; minimal landing page for the TLD
of this site, &lt;a href=&#34;https://araw.xyz&#34;&gt;https://araw.xyz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited some parts in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/bujo&#34;&gt;Bujo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corrected a link from previous log. (h/t to Sahil).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m starting to forget that tropical countries have dry and wet seasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now with the effects of climate change,
we either have dry and drier seasons;
or hot and hotter seasons,
depending on where you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cool temperate days of early January that we predicted
to last until February have faded now.
In its place, a reminder of what it really feels like for the rest of the
year&amp;mdash;sticky, humid, blinding.
&lt;em&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t you forget.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-products-andor-services&#34;&gt;On Products and/or Services&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The designer&amp;rsquo;s focus should be to implement a service or product with safe and sane defaults.
This means that, whether or not the end-user would be bothered to change the
configuration,
their safety and sanity will not be compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Dieter Rams, a good design:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is innovative&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;makes a product useful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is aesthetic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;makes a product understandable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is unobtrusive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is honest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is long-lasting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is thorough down to the last detail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is environmentally-friendly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is as little design as possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not a good designer yet, but I&amp;rsquo;d like to think that at least for this &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/site&#34;&gt;Site&lt;/a&gt;,
I&amp;rsquo;ve hit many of these points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-brutalism&#34;&gt;On Brutalism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since I was interested in architecture,
I&amp;rsquo;ve always thought that brutalism (and its adjacent disciplines)
is a great design style.
It encourages its practitioners to stay &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_to_materials&#34;&gt;true to the
materials&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allowing the materials to give character to the space provides,
in my opinion, warmth that can be hard to achieve through other means.
Moreover, modifying the materials,
of which you&amp;rsquo;re doing little, would require less resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it pragmatic?
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-ones-own-appearance&#34;&gt;On One&amp;rsquo;s Own Appearance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is complex in all kinds of ways.
Many people cope by changing how they present themselves, sometimes
even permanently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;rsquo;s a mix of luck and privilege be able to say, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m okay to live with what I have,
in terms of physiology.&amp;rdquo;
I&amp;rsquo;m far from being a perfect-looking person, but overall, I&amp;rsquo;m stable.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added ten new entries and six new one-liners in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always thought it&amp;rsquo;s important to choose our fights.
This becomes more apparent when we take into account the resources we currently
have,
time being the most important one, in my opinion.
It&amp;rsquo;s also important to know which ones are even worth fighting for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With so many things going on around us,
and the info on such things being readily available on our fingertips (i.e.
through the internet),
it&amp;rsquo;s easy to be overwhelmed which ones to tackle first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you a personal anecdote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime last year,
I learned about the importance of &lt;a href=&#34;https://useplaintext.email/&#34;&gt;using plaintext in emails&lt;/a&gt;
and the etiquettes that come with it.
I thought of implementing this newfound lesson on my next job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I finally got a job early Aug 2021,
I set up my corporate email client (MS Outlook, what else) so that it uses plaintext.
I also tried regularly trimming the emails so the threads didn&amp;rsquo;t get too long, keeping only the pertinent details as I replied and forwarded them.
I thought this would maintain the natural flow of the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This didn&amp;rsquo;t last long&amp;mdash;someone called me out on this weird trend I was trying
to push,
and &amp;ldquo;why does your email &lt;em&gt;look like that&lt;/em&gt;?&amp;rdquo;
What they meant, of course, was my emails, being in plaintext,
weren&amp;rsquo;t beautified in HTML, with all the URLs being exposed,
and the images and logos gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized then that using plaintext in emails &lt;em&gt;in a corporate environment&lt;/em&gt;
wasn&amp;rsquo;t worth the headache of having to explain to my colleagues (perhaps, again
and again)
the logic behind it.
I went back to having HTML in emails so as to not attract unwanted attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of work, I still use plaintext.
So should you, Reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Replaced a rotten link in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/site&#34;&gt;Site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amoy asupre&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Midnight comes,
and we reach the peak of this day&amp;rsquo;s festivity
by lighting so many fireworks, as is the annual tradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The smell of sulfur that comes with it, though, reminds me
of early Jan 2020&amp;rsquo;s Taal eruption,
when wind blew its ashes across nearby regions,
including ours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been wearing face masks since then.
As is the annual tradition?
I hope not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can&amp;rsquo;t help but be a little pessimistic,
especially when the local number of cases of Omicron-variant of COVID is on the rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;del&gt;new&lt;/del&gt; better normal that everyone dreams of has just slipped a bit further
away, it seems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Added some notes on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/site&#34;&gt;Site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited a line in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/&#34;&gt;Index&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited some lines, and added ten new entries and eight new one-liners in &lt;a href=&#34;imbentori&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited some sections in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/mr&#34;&gt;Market Research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed the status of &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/alwayscarry&#34;&gt;Always Carry Website&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;Closed&lt;/strong&gt;.
The site itself should be up for the foreseeable future, but consider it inactive.
Who knows, we might have to revive it when we open a new shop&amp;hellip;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do we have to talk about during transitional periods except the transition
itself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;december-ending&#34;&gt;December ending&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something about the Decemb-weather that scrambles the mind to a semi-useless
state.
Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s hot and humid; sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s rainy; sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s windy.
Often, it&amp;rsquo;s a combination of these.
One can only hope that the human body can keep up with ever-changing weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fog&#34;&gt;Fog&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not brain fog.
Not haze.
It&amp;rsquo;s closer to cognitive dissonance.
I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;m there yet, although I only say that because I&amp;rsquo;m not qualified
to confirm nor deny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I did get to that state,
I&amp;rsquo;d excuse myself for being so&amp;mdash;don&amp;rsquo;t we all have
an excuse to just be tired with all the things that are going on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can be conscious of what&amp;rsquo;s really happening around us,
but takes constant allocation of mental resources,
which, to be honest, is becoming harder and harder to find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our ability to act cannot be rooted on the self alone.
To take all that information and process it outside of a safe space of closely knit
community is detrimental to the human mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full breaths in, full breaths out.
It pays to not semi-forget that.
Stay present whenever possible.
The surface is always within reach and syncs with the body clock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Added 11 new entries and four new one-liners to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minor edit in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/bujo&#34;&gt;Bujo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added new project: &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/mr&#34;&gt;Notes on Market Research&lt;/a&gt;.
Currently, it serves as my personal reference, but hopefully it helps some of
you, too.
It&amp;rsquo;s still in an ugly state, though, so it might not be useable for public.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;toe-clip-overlaphttpssheldonbrowncomgloss_ta-ohtmltoeclipoverlap&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://sheldonbrown.com/gloss_ta-o.html#toeclipoverlap&#34;&gt;Toe Clip Overlap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On many bicycles, especially those with smaller frames and full-sized wheels, it is possible for the front fender or tire to bump into the rider&amp;rsquo;s toe or to the toe clip. Some people worry a lot about this, but it is rarely a significant problem in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only time it can happen is when the handlebars are turned quite far to the side, as only happens at very low speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many, many people ride bicycles with fairly severe overlap with no practical problems, sometimes having to make a slight adjustment to their pedaling habits at very slow speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On smaller-size bikes with full-sized wheels, it is usually impossible to eliminate overlap without causing adverse fit/handling issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When this first happened to me when I got &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/afolk&#34;&gt;FOLK&lt;/a&gt;, I worried that it might
not be the right fit for me.
Good thing that it&amp;rsquo;s a non-issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;when-one-teaches-two-learn&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;When one teaches, two learn.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At work, I explained some things to a newbie.
I managed to break it down for them without using too much jargons.
They said I made sense and were grateful for taking time to enlighten them on
specific processes they were having trouble with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a nice feeling to help others in my own capacity, &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Almost sunset by the rocky beach. Also, excuse the potato quality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beach-less years are never the great ones, although that&amp;rsquo;s just my opinion.
That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s a good thing that this month, I finally saw the sea, in person, again!
I got to swim on it, too, with new friends from work.

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added section to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/disclaimer&#34;&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited some parts in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/bujo&#34;&gt;Bujo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-time&#34;&gt;On Time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, I had romanticized lethargy as an inevitable part of my existence.
I would exit a stressed state of mind,
feeling slightly better, having done virtually nothing of significance.
Sometimes, this didn&amp;rsquo;t affect me.
In fact, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_wei&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;wu wei&lt;/em&gt; 無為&lt;/a&gt; has saved me countless of times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though, doing something good enough would be a better alternative, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it?
But, some critics would argue that Now is the time to do it right&amp;mdash;and
superfast at that!&amp;mdash;;
we might not have the chance to do it again
when (not if) it starts falling apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But&amp;mdash;&lt;em&gt;wu wei&lt;/em&gt;, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-beginning&#34;&gt;On Beginning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I write not because I understand something thoroughly.
Usually, it&amp;rsquo;s me riffing off of something that&amp;rsquo;s already copied from somewhere
else,
an idea so sticky I must do something with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone else has done it already;
and my response is to redo it myself,
if I found it interesting enough.
&amp;ldquo;To understand it,&amp;rdquo; I would say,
&amp;ldquo;I must start from a point of interest.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-transitions&#34;&gt;On Transitions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Em dash (&amp;mdash;) emphasizes; parentheses minimize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En dash (&amp;ndash;) joins inclusive numerals, replacing the word &amp;ldquo;to&amp;rdquo;.
It also joins the names of two or more places. E.g. items 3&amp;ndash;5, Manila&amp;ndash;Quezon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other uses for each, I&amp;rsquo;m sure.
It&amp;rsquo;s just that I don&amp;rsquo;t know them all.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Core Memories</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/67/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 05 Dec 2021 10:30:04 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/67/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/support/&#34;&gt;Support&lt;/a&gt; link on Index for visibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added seven new entries and four new one-liners on &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit some sections on &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/site&#34;&gt;Site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;habits&#34;&gt;Habits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same old habits stir within when triggered by very specific stimuli.
And so I had to look up for more.
More Cartoon Network station IDs or promos or interstitials from the good old
days of early 2000s.
I still know the lines in some of them.
Core memories have been unlocked by chance, but now, where to put them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;adors-fan&#34;&gt;Ador&amp;rsquo;s Fan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ador, my &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/x225&#34;&gt;Thinkpad X225&lt;/a&gt;, never had any fan problems,
even when I thought it had some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was testing the new motherboard (mobo), when I noticed that on boot,
the fan would start spinning, and then stop just after a few seconds.
I had never noticed this before, so I thought this was alarming, the fan being a
regulator of the machine&amp;rsquo;s heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that this is normal.
On boot, the system turns on the fan
as part of the onboard tests,
ensuring that it&amp;rsquo;s working,
until the embedded controller (EC) turns it off after a short while.
When the mobo hits a certain temperature (~60-65 degrees Celsius),
the fan kicks on to do it&amp;rsquo;s job, i.e. exhaust the heat out and away from mobo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;occupation&#34;&gt;Occupation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My diligent, industrious peers and I could have been swimming in the cold waters
of the year&amp;rsquo;s homestretch any day now,
and yet we grind on,
mostly choice-less, as we subsidize the holidays of some people we have never
met with our hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many parts of our life,
we balance effectivity and efficiency.
The two don&amp;rsquo;t always get along;
it&amp;rsquo;s up to us&amp;mdash;&lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;what to choose given the tasks at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Vague Update</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/66/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 21 Nov 2021 06:52:37 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/66/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved the &lt;code&gt;font-family&lt;/code&gt; of this site, thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://systemfontstack.com/&#34;&gt;System Font
Stack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added five new entries and four new one-liners to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed some sections on &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/bujo&#34;&gt;Bujo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s just say that it&amp;rsquo;s been about a year since &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/hi&#34;&gt;I officially launched this
personal site&lt;/a&gt;.
Design-wise, not much has changed.
The brutalist spirit remains at the forefront,
and acts as a natural repellent against those
who are into shiny albeit wobbly things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are down to the last five or six weeks of the year 2021.
But where are we really now?
As an individual?
As a community?
So many of us, including myself, still have some figuring out to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;VAGUE HOPE, VAGUE CONFIDENCE&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; From Diaries of Franz Kafka (1921)
(&lt;em&gt;all-caps stylization mine&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a stand-alone bi-weekly update (first half of Nov 2021):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The motherboard replacement for my Thinkpad arrived.
It turned out that the seller shipped the wrong one;
it&amp;rsquo;s a mobo for a different model.
They were kind enough, though, to send a replacement for &lt;em&gt;piso!&lt;/em&gt; (Php 1.00)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had lunch-out with workmates somewhere in Quezon City.
It was my first time seeing a lot of them, what they actually look like in
person,
and how they are in the flæsh.
See, we&amp;rsquo;re always off-cam in calls in our work-from-home setups, &amp;ldquo;to save
bandwidth.&amp;rdquo;
To my knowledge, we&amp;rsquo;re all fully vaccinated there, so all (relatively) good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work is work is burning through my hours like jet flame through lint.
Supposedly, it&amp;rsquo;s because corporations are going manic on getting data on this
last quarter of the year (Q4) for their
forecasts and whatnot.
I&amp;rsquo;d like to empower my colleagues,
even in unorthodox ways,
but even that is unlikely lest I burn myself on the way out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have resorted again to listening to &amp;ldquo;City Pop 80&amp;rsquo;s Japan&amp;rdquo; muzak just to stay
sane.
But, as the meme goes, I am now having visions of memories of a time and place I
wasn&amp;rsquo;t in as a consequence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m no longer just watching my dreams from a third-person point of
view.
I now enact them as they happen.
Solipsism resurfaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Home Alone</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/65/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 31 Oct 2021 17:30:00 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/65/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With that title I&amp;rsquo;ve already mislead you.
I&amp;rsquo;m not &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; alone, and no, I don&amp;rsquo;t mean that in the Halloween spooky sense.
I&amp;rsquo;m with three cats and a dog, all of them somewhat benign companions that help
me from spiraling down just by being there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am, however, the only human here, since Isya vacationed in Dumaguete for a
little over a month.
Little to no human interaction has made me retreat further into introspection,
but that&amp;rsquo;s not necessarily a bad thing in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me share some of them here.
J&amp;rsquo;aime tellement cette sélection.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;all-house-chores-on-me&#34;&gt;All house chores on me&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repetitive nature of domestic work, to me, can alleviate some stress.
I put them all in a routine, and on most days, the tasks seem to get done
&amp;ldquo;automatically.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it&amp;rsquo;s not every day that I get to complete all house chores.
Sometimes, I get too caught up in my work so that by the end of the day,
I only have a couple functioning brain cells left and barely energy left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;uncertainties&#34;&gt;Uncertainties&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The COVID pandemic has not only put to surface the fragility of the current
systems that make society function, but also constantly nags them as if to
encourage an imminent collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, a lot of things in our modern life require some form of
importation.
As we continue to rely on outsourcing our needs and wants,
the strain on environmental resources grows.
This way of life won&amp;rsquo;t be sustainable, no matter the ways of greenwashing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read a contrapoint somewhere that goes something like:
there won&amp;rsquo;t be a collapse; just an unending descent to dread and misery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;feelings&#34;&gt;Feelings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking and feeling becomes an everyday task of the lonesome man of the house.
This is good, in my opinion;
I get to analyze myself, know myself more through the cycles of emotions,
and understand how each of them are triggered by which stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, I rationalized every move.
But now is the time to be more human, to feel feelings as they are meant to be,
not be intellectualized!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just need to remind myself to pull myself from the introspection limbo from
time to time.
People who overthink will have a higher chance at The Good Life if they
process their thoughts in healthier ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;no-smoking&#34;&gt;No Smoking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reading the lyrics of &lt;em&gt;Cornerstone&lt;/em&gt; by Arctic Monkeys in Genius, complete
with annotation.
And a thought jumped at me:
I suddenly missed smoking for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I doubt that&amp;rsquo;s internally true;
I just miss its aesthetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t miss the smell, and how it lingers on every surface, including my hair
and skin.
I don&amp;rsquo;t miss how people move away from me because of said smell (stench,
really).
I don&amp;rsquo;t miss the addiction, the financial costs to sustain it, the damage on my body it has caused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I love this selection.&amp;rdquo;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Frankenpad X225</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/64/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 30 Oct 2021 03:51:58 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/64/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ador, my Thinkpad X220, got its motherboard (mobo) fried a little over two
months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my research online, a Thinkpad X230 mobo could be a drop-in replacement.
I only needed to modify some bits in the chassis,
and the resulting &amp;ldquo;Frankenpad&amp;rdquo; should be better than X220.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href=&#34;https://panacek.net/post/frankenpad_x225/&#34;&gt;this guide&lt;/a&gt; by a certain
Jiri Panacek during my first
round of research.
But at the time of writing this, it returns a 403 Forbidden error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, someone archived it in the Wayback Machine.
You can visit the entirety of the guide &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20200124134623/https://panacek.net/post/frankenpad_x225/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below the line are sections copied from the guide for my case.
This will be my reference when I finally fix Ador with the X230 mobo I ordered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThinkPad X230 is a generation update which shares many components with the previous X220 model.
There are still some differences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new chicklet keyboard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;slightly different palmrest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a mini DisplayPort instead of the full-size DisplayPort&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;most importantly, Ivy Bridge chipset which outperforms its older brother, especially when it comes to the integrated graphics card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pros&#34;&gt;Pros:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ivy Bridge chipset with the official Windows 10 support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved graphics performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two USB 3.0 ports&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for two external LCD screens plus one internal (with Mini Dock Plus Series 3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lenovo officially supports drivers for Windows 7, 8, 8.1 and 10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cons&#34;&gt;Cons:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;X230 is not officially compatible with x220 batteries (you need to flash the embedded controller)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You lose the CapsLock LED indicator on the keyboard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;COA Windows sticker does not match the OS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TPFanControl does not show all sensors for the Ivy Bridge chipset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A weird hole around the mini DisplayPort connector&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;process&#34;&gt;Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obtain X230 mobo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace thermal paste under CPU heatsink (optional but recommended).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take laptop apart and replace the motherboard. &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/iJs01Q8EuDw&#34;&gt;Video (Youtube) reference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Install_Classic_Keyboard_on_xx30_Series_ThinkPads&#34;&gt;Modify the
keyboard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put everything together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hamishcoleman/thinkpad-ec&#34;&gt;Flash the EC controller&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Done!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Going on a short trip on a not-my-bike is better than not riding out on a Sunday afternoon.
The weather isn&amp;rsquo;t so bad either, hijo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have mentally sketched my route based on the errands that I needed to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get the not-my-bike fixed so the rear wheel doesn&amp;rsquo;t wobble;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;buy urinary S/O cat food;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eat beef pares at Pares House&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/image/pares.jpeg&#34;
    alt=&#34;Garlic fried rice and beef pares&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s an alright scene from the potato phone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, they have less than ideal conditions on the premises,
but the quality of the beef pares has been declining.
It&amp;rsquo;s still good and edible, but at this rate,
we might have to look elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I received my second jab of AstraZenica last 9 Oct.
It&amp;rsquo;s been two weeks since.
That must mean that the vaccine&amp;rsquo;s effect should be in full swing now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does not mean that I&amp;rsquo;ll be careless and reckless.
&lt;em&gt;Although&lt;/em&gt; I have some out-of-town trips planned out in the coming weeks.
I&amp;rsquo;m not necessarily excited to be in them,
but I figured a scenery change wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be so bad for mental
health, right?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fixing Some Broken Images</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/61/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 22 Oct 2021 10:48:16 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/61/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I noticed recently that some of the images in this site were broken,
that is, they didn&amp;rsquo;t show up.
Before I push the updates to live,
I always make sure that everything is looking the way I want them to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, just because it works on the local instance doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it would work
well in live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good thing that I make it a habbit to put alternative texts to all images in the
site,
so that&amp;rsquo;s what I was seeing instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After investigating and asking around&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,
I found that the problem was due to file permissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;troubleshooting&#34;&gt;Troubleshooting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a modern browser (I use Firefox), I opened the network tab in the developer tools.
I reloaded a localhost instance (&lt;code&gt;localhost:1313&lt;/code&gt; using &lt;code&gt;hugo server&lt;/code&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;),
and the live website instance.
I compared the requested paths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the broken images, they indicated 403 errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;http-403&#34;&gt;HTTP 403&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTTP 403 status code means &amp;ldquo;access forbidden&amp;rdquo;.
With &amp;ldquo;forbidden&amp;rdquo; being the operative word,
we can infer that the file exists in the server,
it&amp;rsquo;s just that the server won&amp;rsquo;t serve the file to you
because you&amp;rsquo;re not allowed to it.
It&amp;rsquo;s different from HTTP status 404, which means &amp;ldquo;file not found&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;file-permissions&#34;&gt;File Permissions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to some folks I asked in the internet,
this 403 errors is usually caused by access permission problems on ther server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, some of the files (images) that I pushed live to server were owned
&lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; by my user account in my local machine.
The server &amp;ldquo;respected&amp;rdquo; this, and, in effect, didn&amp;rsquo;t display these images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;changing-file-permissionsfp&#34;&gt;Changing File Permissions&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To view permissions of all files in a folder, type &lt;code&gt;ls -la&lt;/code&gt; in the terminal.
Broken images would look like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;-rw------- oqo oqo &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;44486&lt;/span&gt; Feb  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;2021&lt;/span&gt;  mi1.jpeg
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make them viewable by using &lt;code&gt;chmod&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;sudo chmod u&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;rw,g&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;r,o&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;r mi1.jpeg
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;sudo chmod &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;644&lt;/span&gt; mi1.jpeg
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ending result, with file permissions changed, would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;-rw-r--r-- oqo oqo &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;44486&lt;/span&gt; Feb  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;2021&lt;/span&gt;  mi1.jpeg
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hunger, the physical, guttural one,
is a penitence most of us won&amp;rsquo;t choose,
unless it&amp;rsquo;s for something important, like health or spirituality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I&amp;rsquo;ll always look for food when I&amp;rsquo;m hungry,
a natural reaction polished by evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But neither evolution not common social conventions could have prepared me for a
cat sitting on my lap,
un-budging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How am I supposed to get food then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/image/ed.jpg&#34;
    alt=&#34;cat between the lap and table&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;

      <title>Semantics</title>

      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/59/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added sections in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/bujo&#34;&gt;Bujo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people are so hung up on using proper semantics,
not realizing that humans,
of varying experiences and struggles,
will naturally find more creative ways to express themselves,
even if it means &amp;ldquo;misusing&amp;rdquo; words and phrases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some do it as a coping mechanism.
Some do it for the lulz.
Some do it to pave a path to creative enlightenment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes me wonder how linguists are trying to keep up with the evolution of
language in real observable time.
If you are one, please, I&amp;rsquo;m interested in hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, that&amp;rsquo;s a fine line to walk on.
People may, knowingly or otherwise, co-opt terms from experiences and struggles
beyond their own to push their agenda.
Apart from it being inappropriate to say the least,
we can tell from afar that such narrative lacks authenticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s proverb:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look here, lackey: Liu Kang&amp;rsquo;s low kick to bloke&amp;rsquo;s prick is low-key Loki.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>mSATA to USB Adapter: A Quick Mid-October Update</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/58/</link>

      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/58/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Late this afternoon, I just received the aforementioned adapter
that I ordered from Shopee.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been using mSATA SSD when Ador (a thinkpad X220) was still active.
To access my current OS and files there, said adapter is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is proof that my mSATA SSD and the adapter I bought
works together.
I booted into the OS installed in it via Isya&amp;rsquo;s Thinkpad T440, codename: Trader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll see you in a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Wake me up when September rends</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/57/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Sep 2021 12:10:36 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/57/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My main laptop (&amp;ldquo;Ador&amp;rdquo;) broke on me about a month ago now (as of writing this).
Twice I ordered a replacement motherboard in Lazada, and twice the seller cancelled on me.
They gave me no reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m typing this on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/old-computer&#34;&gt;old computer&lt;/a&gt; that I used last July.
But this won&amp;rsquo;t get published until I figure out how to SSH into my server without my keys.
A hard lesson, I guess, for me, and a reminder for you, to always have a back-up for everything.
What you can, keep a copy of it somewhere, kids!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the good side, I got to focus more on my newfound job.
I career-shifted into it, so learning the new ways of working can be tricky, and requires my full attention.
The thing is, even stripped down and minimal, I still find excuses to make Ador distract me.
Mainly, it&amp;rsquo;s because of my RSS feed.
I like reading blogs and op-eds and people&amp;rsquo;s technical perspectives on things that I find interesting.
I call it Research when it adds value to me;
mindless consumption when it doesn&amp;rsquo;t.
Would you guess how many hours I had spent thoughtlessly perusing articles?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the bad side, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; Windows, and all of its heavily restricting apps.
Office 365 almost requires the user to be perpetually be online.
I&amp;rsquo;m losing my Vim- and Unix-game here, people, help me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Creative Writing in a Second Language</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/56/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 29 Aug 2021 08:25:50 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/56/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello!
Here are the recent changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Definitely removed all emojis from all pages in this site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added minor notes for &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/server&#34;&gt;Homebrew Server&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added four new entries and four new one-liners in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking and writing in English will always be a life-long learning experience,
especially for non-native speakers like me.
Some would agree that mastering a second language would eventually involve
playing with words and intending puns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the following stream of consciousness from my drafts folder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multi-colored roofs in a neighborhood of dreams
of varying contours and angles,
and how they deflect light,
would definitely have an impact on my body if I would approach
one of them from above, as commanded by gravity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote this some two years ago.
It beats around the bush, sure,
because I was like that back
then&amp;mdash;a person full of uncertainties.
Going through the motions felt like free-falling
to my Being&amp;rsquo;s demise (not necessarily a physical death),
but more boring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have another one, from &lt;em&gt;the same&lt;/em&gt; draft:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can&amp;rsquo;t pinpoint for sure the exact source of all the twisting,
but if I had to think aloud,
it might have come from the accumulation of dirt and crime,
small though they may be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly attempting to hide by a burning bush then,
but these timestamped notes encrypted my emotions and,
at the same time, purged me of my little demons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s one minute,
I&amp;rsquo;ll see you next time!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On Abstractions</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/55/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 19 Aug 2021 03:04:42 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/55/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removed unnecessary emojis in most, if not all, of the pages.
I realize now that they only add clutter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New section in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/site&#34;&gt;Site&lt;/a&gt; where I briefly discuss Typography.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added the dotfiles I used for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/old-computer&#34;&gt;Old Computer Challenge&lt;/a&gt; last
month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added ten new entries and four new one-liners in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copypasta humor about construction,
one of the industries that directly opposes Life for various reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all construction work is equally enjoyable.
For example, enlarging a drilled hole is boring,
but fastening pieces of metal together is riveting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to think that I&amp;rsquo;m a laid back person
with a generalist-at-best mental aptitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract ideas always lure me in
and, perhaps as a consequence,
I almost always have an aversion
to concrete things like&amp;hellip; Most of Reality.
I might have delved into kiddie solipsism
when I was in preschool,
the details of which I vaguely recall now,
only the feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why I like broad abstractions like &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/math&#34;&gt;Math&lt;/a&gt;, Physics, and Post-structuralism,
although it&amp;rsquo;s a shame that I never got around
going deeper into any of it.
Maybe in the future, I will.
I&amp;rsquo;d like to learn still, after all,
so there&amp;rsquo;s nothing stopping me,
except bills to pay and food to obtain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s weird is,
I never enjoyed thinking about anything that much.
Wait, let me rephrase:
I can only allocate so much of my mental capacity
at any one endeavor for a period of time.
After that, I&amp;rsquo;ll have to do something else to recharge my interest.
I do overthink about some things from time to time.
But I&amp;rsquo;d rather delegate what I can to others,
if it weren&amp;rsquo;t for the fact that I don&amp;rsquo;t want to bother people.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Thoughts on LinkedIn</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/54/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 Aug 2021 00:01:30 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/54/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a social networking site (SNS).
Don&amp;rsquo;t let anyone make you believe otherwise.
It&amp;rsquo;s different, yes, in that it caters to the boring aspects of one&amp;rsquo;s professional
life.
I only say boring because the platform never really appealed to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with any other SNS,
LinkedIn&amp;rsquo;s in-house culture encourages its participants
to exaggerate their&amp;mdash;for the lack of better term&amp;mdash;content.
In an online space that aggregates different people from different failing
economies,
I&amp;rsquo;d argue that this act is crucial to one&amp;rsquo;s survival,
if survival in this context meant getting better job with better wage and
benefits
exerting the least possible effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, if you&amp;rsquo;re well off,
overamplification of content may serve you a different purpose,
although I will always doubt its authenticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this talk, only to tell you that I&amp;rsquo;m no better.
For a while, I did adopt the title of &amp;ldquo;Sustainable Technologist.&amp;rdquo;
All things considered, this might well be legitimate,
because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I do believe that we should all practice sustainability in all aspects of our
lives, whenever and wherever we can.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And I also believe that as humans,
it&amp;rsquo;s our duty to use tools,
of varying degrees of technological complexity (or simplicity!),
to make the world a better place than we found it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the term sustainability gets greenwashed a lot.
It doesn&amp;rsquo;t help that I used it in LinkedIn,
the SNS where big companies who do such thing flock!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People inventing titles for themselves
(like my &amp;ldquo;Sustainable Technologist&amp;rdquo; one)
reminds me of Sherlock Holmes.
When asked what his job was,
people were confused.
They hadn&amp;rsquo;t heard of &amp;ldquo;Consulting Detective.&amp;rdquo;
Holmes admitted that he made it up,
perhaps based on the nature of his work,
and that he&amp;rsquo;s literally the only one with that title in the [fictional] world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, I&amp;rsquo;ll keep my account in the platform,
because I find it somewhat useful for the edge cases that I still have in my
online presence.
But I long for the day that I won&amp;rsquo;t be needing it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited several sections of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/site&#34;&gt;Site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added new way to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/support&#34;&gt;Support&lt;/a&gt; me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added 23 new entries and 13 new one-liners for &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/cv&#34;&gt;CV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been two days now since my first jab of the AstraZenica vaccine&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
Side effects are almost gone now,
unlike on the first day when I suffered a splitting headache,
so much so that I had difficulty getting to deep sleep.
We&amp;rsquo;re also told that we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t drink coffee (or tea)
for two days&amp;mdash;something to do with possible dehydration.
Not sure; I didn&amp;rsquo;t hear the garbled speak of the doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I jokingly suspect that caffeine withdrawal may have worsen the side effects.
That&amp;rsquo;s my un-scientific take on it.
Don&amp;rsquo;t quote me on that.
Tomorrow, I shall drink coffee again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shoutout to my siblings and their respective partners for making this
legally happen!&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added eight new entries and a new one-liner to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Index redux&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/blogroll&#34;&gt;Blogroll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minor edit in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/site&#34;&gt;Site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simplified the blurb in this site&amp;rsquo;s footer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/bujo&#34;&gt;Bujo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to both the still-high COVID daily infections,
and the looming new (in the country) delta variant,
Metro Manila will, again, be under a lockdown in the coming days.
Restocking the essentials becomes a non-negotiable task in the to-do list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of which is cycling &amp;ldquo;downtown&amp;rdquo; to get coffee beans.
A kilogram of it will last about a month
for two (sometimes three) people drinking caffeine daily,
so I only bought that amount.
We&amp;rsquo;re careful to overstock;
coffee beans that don&amp;rsquo;t get used for a long time
will degrade (citation &lt;em&gt;knea&lt;/em&gt;ded).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The roundtrip is roughly 23 km
of wildly varying elevation.
Thanks to that errand,
I have now X&amp;rsquo;d today&amp;rsquo;s workout quota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to prolong my life,
I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing exercises since the pandemic started.
That&amp;rsquo;s more than a year now.
It&amp;rsquo;s nothing serious;
just basic HIIT and calisthenics,
if there&amp;rsquo;s even a difference between the two.
I want to be consistent in my schedule,
but willpower depletes fast,
and I can only work with what I have.
But something, I believe, is better than nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When there&amp;rsquo;s an opportunity, I add cycling to my exercise.
Actually, such opportunity presented itself earlier in the morning,
hours before the downtown errand.
Someone from a nearby village ordered two bags of tofu cat litter,
from &lt;a href=&#34;https://alwayscarry.netlify.app/home&#34;&gt;my partner&amp;rsquo;s little operation&lt;/a&gt;.
I delivered the bags myself to the client.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
I consider it a win-win for all parties involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In another news&lt;/strong&gt;,
after some five months of unemployment,
I have a new work now starting on Monday.
Readers and visitors are reminded that any opinions here in this site
are mine alone;
they don&amp;rsquo;t belong to my employer, past, present, future.
See &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/disclaimer&#34;&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gimmick is,
if the client is from one of the four villages nearby,
delivery, by me on a bike, is free,
unless it&amp;rsquo;s way more than I can carry in a backpack.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Break Into Chunks</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/51/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 01:07:15 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/51/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/support&#34;&gt;Support&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/di-why&#34;&gt;list of project ideas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, removed the to-do section in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/site&#34;&gt;Site&lt;/a&gt; project.
Consider this site more independent, privacy-respecting, and secure for all visitors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added a new section to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/old-computer&#34;&gt;Old Computer Challenge&lt;/a&gt;,
and fixed some links.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added new entries to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt;.
Nice!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still far from completing the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/41&#34;&gt;CS50x&lt;/a&gt; course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get now why it has a cult-like following:
it explains the foundations of computer science well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I learned anything in school,
it&amp;rsquo;s to read first the entire problem before approaching it.
That&amp;rsquo;s why I like how in the problem sets,
the write-up breaks down the problem into manageable sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back when I was self-teaching myself how to code,
I kept on reading the importance of this step from more experienced programmers.
It&amp;rsquo;s only now that I understand why.
This way, I find that solving
a subproblem&amp;mdash;or reaching a milestone if you will&amp;mdash;makes
solving the entire thing more enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m half-expecting that the &amp;ldquo;training wheels&amp;rdquo; shall come off later in the course.
And that&amp;rsquo;s fine.
Real world problems are often sophisticated,
and require the problem solvers to be able to come up with possible ideas on their own.
My experience so far tells me that CS50x lets me form good coding habits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Added some sections in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/old-computer&#34;&gt;Old Computer Challenge&lt;/a&gt;.
Will still be polishing it in the coming days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;got-new-old-bike-from-a-japan-surplussurplus&#34;&gt;Got new-old bike from a Japan surplus&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://folkbyaresbikes.tumblr.com/&#34;&gt;FOLK by Aresbikes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For posterity, here are the specs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Size 51 cm seat tube, center to top&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;52 cm top tube, center to center&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chromoly&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; steel frame and fork&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;90 mm oversized stem aluminum&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;54 cm gentleman’s bar aluminum&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tektro mini brakes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dual pivot brake caliper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High flange hubs aluminum&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flip-flop rear hubs single speed/fixed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prowheel chariot single crankset 170 arm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30 mm aero rims 700c with brakeline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;27.2 mm seatpost&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;700x28c tires&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s rusty on some joints, and it may need some minor adjustments,
but I like it!
As long as it can transport me between two or more points,
I&amp;rsquo;m good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;some-weeknotes&#34;&gt;Some weeknotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not share some of the thoughts I&amp;rsquo;ve had during the Old Computer Challenge?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I found no lame excuse to look in the mirror and admire from time to time the way Isya cut my hair. &lt;em&gt;Galing eh!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walking the dog daily must be a thing,
but we only have limited willpower.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally got around to finishing the graphic novel &lt;em&gt;V for Vendetta&lt;/em&gt;.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been putting that off for weeks now.
Personally, I like David Lloyd&amp;rsquo;s artwork.
It&amp;rsquo;s written without sound effects, which creates a disorienting experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to a meme, there&amp;rsquo;s a new talk show:
&amp;ldquo;Looking at the symptoms of Capitalism weekly while avoiding the underlying problem, with John Oliver&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People who speak loudly, almost shouting, why?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do I even need a proper camera when, to me, photographs act only as visual anchors?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can create even with a simple aesthetic.
In fact, simplicity is a template that has guided my expression recently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is Day 8, last day of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/old-computer&#34;&gt;Old Computer Challenge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many things, bikes included,
that the Japanese people don&amp;rsquo;t want anymore,
some Filipino merchants buy in bulk and resell here.
In theory, one gets a good product&amp;mdash;because
it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Made in Japan&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;for
a reasonably affordable price.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chromoly steel is a type of low alloy steel
(chromium + molybdenum)
that&amp;rsquo;s used when strength is required.
Also used in high pressure and temperature,
commonly found in oil &amp;amp; gas, energy, construction, and automotive industries.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ticked off some of the items in the to-do lists for my &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/site&#34;&gt;Site&lt;/a&gt;.
Finally had the resources to move away from GitHub Pages into my own VPS.
Also edited a few lines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited a few terms in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/old-computer&#34;&gt;Old Computer Challenge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another brand new (Fri)day?
What now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re feeling extra generous today,
so we walked our dog twice.
Morning walk was to the bank (ATM only).
Traffic hadn&amp;rsquo;t build up yet then.
Evening walk was just a shortened version of our usual route.
Already late to get a good look at sunset.
The evening summons the joggers and dog-walkers.
We participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to put some time, though, to train the dog.
It can be hard to remain upright when a ~20-kg canine yanks you because of something excited him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is Day 7 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/old-computer&#34;&gt;Old Computer Challenge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Added some lines in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/old-computer&#34;&gt;Old Computer Challenge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Renamed the (closed) project &amp;ldquo;Own Web Server&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/server&#34;&gt;Homebrew Server&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; for clarity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not much to report today.
Biked about 12 kilometers one way,
under the hot and humid tropical day of course,
to return the mountain bike,
the one I used on the way there,
to its rightful home.
Uphills are still a struggle.
The reward for getting to the peak is more road to travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is Day 6 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/old-computer&#34;&gt;Old Computer Challenge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Is It Flu Season Already?</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/47/</link>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rearraged the sections in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/old-computer&#34;&gt;Old Computer Challenge&lt;/a&gt; for better flow of thought.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removed sections in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/server&#34;&gt;Server&lt;/a&gt; project.
It&amp;rsquo;s already closed and archived.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changes have been made in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/disclaimer&#34;&gt;disclaimer&lt;/a&gt;, both in the footer and the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DISCLAIMER:
I&amp;rsquo;m not an expert in medicine, anthropology, or in medical anthrpology.
Please do your due diligence before (dis)agreeing with anything below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not qualified to say whether it&amp;rsquo;s already flu season.
I do notice that some of the people in my circles are feeling under the weather.
Given our current situation,
coughing alone would raise some alarms;
what more for having a fever?
Any symptom that&amp;rsquo;s slightly related to influenza is not to be taken lightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, then and now, pandemic and all,
people&amp;rsquo;s self-medication rely heavily on modern pharmaceuticals.
Where our first-world contemporaries would seek medical help on the earliest signs of flu (in the context of Covid pandemic),
here in our country,
we would just rest it out in our homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healthcare is inaccessible for most of us,
oppressing even.
Private doctors are out of budget,
and public health centers don&amp;rsquo;t function well.
On the other hand,
drugs are found to be available in sari-sari stores at relatively low price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, lack of knowledge leaves us choosing from a limited range of pharmaceuticals,
even if there are so many brands in the market.
Where does that get us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve read the disclaimer above,
then you know I have nothing to offer but my observations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is Day 5 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/old-computer&#34;&gt;Old Computer Challenge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added sections and edited some lines in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/old-computer&#34;&gt;Old Computer Challenge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One&amp;rsquo;s life collects experiences as one oscillate between the good and bad news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bad-news&#34;&gt;Bad news&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our very own himbo cat has done it again!
In his boredom he cut the patch cord of our wifi router that we &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/simplex&#34;&gt;already had replaced&lt;/a&gt;.
I keep calling him &lt;em&gt;himbo&lt;/em&gt;
but maybe disrupting our boring lives is part of his grander plot?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;good-news&#34;&gt;Good news&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No big deal, though.
We immediately got the replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the interim, Isya and I tried to play games in &lt;code&gt;/usr/games/&lt;/code&gt;.
Text based games can be fun, but the ones included here got boring real quick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bad-news-1&#34;&gt;Bad news&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone close to us has a flu.
Nothing is certain yet, so we don&amp;rsquo;t want to jinx it.
It could just be the rapidly changing weather, for all we know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;good-news-1&#34;&gt;Good news&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something came in the mail about my having a better near-future.
More on that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is Day 4 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/old-computer&#34;&gt;Old Computer Challenge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Trese</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/45/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 00:30:01 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/45/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added sections to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/old-computer&#34;&gt;Old Computer Challenge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve just finished watching the first season of Trese in Netflix.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s an animated adaptation of the comics of the same title,
written by Budjette Tan and illustrated by Kajo Baldisimo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s only six episodes,
and yet I convinced Isya to not binge-watch it in one sitting&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;brief-review&#34;&gt;Brief Review&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither a fan of the comics nor the animated adaptation.
That&amp;rsquo;s not to say, though, that I dislike it.
In line with &amp;ldquo;supporting local [artists],&amp;rdquo;
I humbly offer my thoughts,
spoiler-free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;writing&#34;&gt;Writing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could&amp;rsquo;ve been better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Characters could have been more &amp;ldquo;human&amp;rdquo;;
others feel flat or forced or tokenistic.
Antagonists could have had more believable purpose in them other than just being bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plot could have revealed more,
explained more why this person must do this,
why this event must happen, etc.
I guess everything&amp;rsquo;s too tight to make room for more exposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some lines felt unnatural,
like no normal person would say them in day-to-day life.
And I can already hear some of you arguing that,
&amp;ldquo;How dare you consider people in Trese Universe to be normal?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;visual-arts&#34;&gt;Visual Arts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the how the backdrops are rendered visually.
Very representative of Metro Manila:
chaotic but magnetizing still to a lot of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lack of fluidity in motion (frame rate) is understandable,
since a huge chunk of the budget must have been dedicated to the action sequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I like the look of Alexandra Trese in comics.
In the adaptation,
she looks too&amp;hellip; polished, too white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which, colorism is a major criticism for the show.
Why is it that the protagonists and their allies are fair- and light-skinned,
and the bad guys are dark-skinned?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;voice-acting&#34;&gt;Voice Acting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m with the internet on this one;
they definitely could&amp;rsquo;ve hired a more competent lead voice actor for Alexandra Trese for the Filipino dub.
Or at least they could&amp;rsquo;ve trained Liza Soberano more to be naturally sounding when speaking Tagalog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ost&#34;&gt;OST&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quality muzak!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can imagine myself setting my alarm tone to the opening theme
and waking up to it,
ready to take the day&amp;rsquo;s challenge(r)s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closing theme is good, too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We never skipped both the opening and closing themes because we enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s likely that the good and the bad of the show resulted from
factors like budget, creators&amp;rsquo; existing internal belief systems, target audience, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fans expect that the next season (?) improves,
and the onus is on the creators and producers to meet this new standard
if they even hope to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is Day 3 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/old-computer&#34;&gt;Old Computer Challenge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watched it on a MacBook Pro, though.
Not on the old computer I&amp;rsquo;m currently using.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Binge-watching is a modern phenomenon that I think we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be getting into.
It has the potential to waste time;
and is unhealthy especially when it makes one inactive for long periods of time.
When watching a series, I make it a point to only watch one episode per day,
assuming that more (or all) episodes are readily available for consumption.
This gives me time to digest and process what I just watched,
and perhaps speculate on what might happen next,
which is equally stimulating.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Added sections and edited some lines in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/old-computer&#34;&gt;Old Computer Challenge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited some lines in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/bujo&#34;&gt;Bujo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I got a new haircut, care of Isya.
We&amp;rsquo;ve been planning this for a while,
but certain predicaments kept getting in the way of my having a new look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a curtain as a makeshift apron over my torso as shield against falling hair,
under the 30-degree-something-Celsius weather,
only made me sweat more than usual.
A small sacrifice to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be said that this isn&amp;rsquo;t the first time that Isya has cut my hair.
I liked the result of the last time,
and I like the one now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sulit!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is Day 2 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/old-computer&#34;&gt;Old Computer Challenge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Signs of Aging</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/43/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 10 Jul 2021 03:52:29 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/43/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello there,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s update is, well,
about how my life in general kicks me &lt;em&gt;initially&lt;/em&gt;
in the ass&amp;mdash;butt first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/old-computer&#34;&gt;The Old Computer Challenge&lt;/a&gt;.
I decided to list it as a &amp;ldquo;project&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m participating in said challenge using the MSI Wind that I initially intended to be my &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/server&#34;&gt;server&lt;/a&gt;.
Since this metal is i386 architecture,
there are only a handful of systems that still support this
that&amp;rsquo;s fit to run on modern age.
For me, replacing Windows &lt;em&gt;XP&lt;/em&gt; (!) with OpenBSD only makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Configuring this system so it&amp;rsquo;s useable for a whole week is important to me.
That&amp;rsquo;s why I spent some time customizing it, from colors, key bindings,
to the programs that can run on this machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this got me thinking:
it&amp;rsquo;s weird that when it comes to technology,
especially those that have electronics in them,
anything that&amp;rsquo;s older than five is already considered &amp;ldquo;old.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term implies experience, maybe signs of aging.
The older a piece of technology is,
the harder it is to maintain it to keep up with the demands of modern times.
Replacement parts may either be out of production,
hard to find due to scarcity,
or are themselves already refurbished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But refurbish and/or upcycle old tech we must, in my opinion,
so long as resources would still allow it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is Day 1 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/old-computer&#34;&gt;Old Computer Challenge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Simplex Patch Cord</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/42/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 02 Jul 2021 02:37:39 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/42/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actually updated the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/cv.pdf&#34;&gt;pdf of my CV&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added a few lines in the foreword of &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt;.
There are 19 new entries and a dozen one-liners there as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added new blogs in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/blogroll&#34;&gt;Blogroll&lt;/a&gt; to check out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added a new short section to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/bujo&#34;&gt;Bujo&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the cats, an archetypal himbo,
managed to gnaw on the fiber optic cable of the ISP&amp;rsquo;s router.
This resulted in losing both internet and phone connections.
We&amp;rsquo;re all furious!
This never happened in the already many months that he, the cat, has been here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps lacking manpower, our ISP&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; couldn&amp;rsquo;t immediately send any technician,
despited repeated follow-ups from our end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isya and I then had a discussion about how this ISP
(or any other ISPs for that matter)
should improve their services.
Start by giving better benefits and wages to their employees.
Provide them with the needed tools of the trade on company&amp;rsquo;s expense, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While angry customers shouldn&amp;rsquo;t berate field technicians and other customer-facing agents for poor service,
ISP management should understand that throwing bureaucracy at customers only insults them.
Corporate speak will never sound polite.
In fact, I&amp;rsquo;d argue that poor customer service provided by &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; company
is an inevitable result of late-stage capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, imagine: your income, in whatever form,
heavily relies on digital telecommunications;
and it all goes down because of some bored pet toying with a fragile cord.
And some exhausted, possibly underpaid, personnel has to deal with that brewing vitriol &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; still be polite.
What a time to be alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(For the record:
none of us spewed vile shite to anyone.
We&amp;rsquo;re nice people, people.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we&amp;rsquo;re offline for three days.
I don&amp;rsquo;t see it as particularly deplorable;
there are other things to do in the house,
books to read,
thoughts to think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title of this post is what the mangled cord is called.
I don&amp;rsquo;t think I can repair it, if it even is repairable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this third (or is it fourth) day of having no internet presence,
we decided to act instead of just wait.
My sibling physically went to a nearby office of the ISP to see
if she could find some quicker resolution there,
bringing with her the cord as proof/reference.
A personnel, perhaps noting how easily solvable her (our) problem was,
produced a replacement cord for free!
Now, we&amp;rsquo;re back online again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct action does get the goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epilogue:
A few hours after that,
a technician &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; arrive.
I told him that we already solved the issue ourselves.
He only had me signed a form (closing ticket?) before he went on his way.
Our interaction did not last two minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://pldthome.com&#34;&gt;PLDT&lt;/a&gt;, btw.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/41/</link>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Due to life happening, I&amp;rsquo;m closing the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/server&#34;&gt;Server&lt;/a&gt; project.
I may or may not reopen it in the future.
If I do, it may or may not be in similar form.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added seven new entries and one new one-liner in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I signed up for Harvard&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science/&#34;&gt;Intro to Computer Science&lt;/a&gt; last December,
I whooshed past the first two videos in 1.5x speed.
I don&amp;rsquo;t recommend doing this,
unless you&amp;rsquo;re somehow forced to go through it against your will.
From what I&amp;rsquo;ve experienced so far,
the course work is fun and engaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the internet, it&amp;rsquo;s a good course to take,
and it has changed lives.
Right now, I may be in need of a life-changing event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the online course that I signed up for was put
behind the scenes for several months.
A few days ago, I decided to revisit it and make it more official
by getting an official certificate from them,
through &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x&#34;&gt;edX&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately,
edX is offering financial assistance that,
when granted,
would slash off 90% of the fee&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to get an official certificate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I applied and got granted.
A small victory worth celebrating over brewed coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For good measure,
I restarted the course yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may or may not share here the course work that I do there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why&#34;&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always bloomed late in things that I&amp;rsquo;ve grown to like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started enjoying writing as a form of creative expression during the last few months of my high school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading as a hobby, not as a school exercise, only came to me when I was already in college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interest in computer programming waltzed in during the Covid-19 Pandemic Lockdown of 2020.
I hope it&amp;rsquo;s not too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we&amp;rsquo;re to discount boredom&amp;mdash;although
we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t, because it&amp;rsquo;s helpful when we least expect it&amp;mdash;one
reason for this particular interest
is a need to be independent from the on-going centralization
of Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that by learning more about computer science
and programming language/s can afford me the autonomy I seek.
And perhaps I&amp;rsquo;ll help somebody along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing.
Might change in the future.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added six new entries to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt; while removing a few lines here and there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added a few lines in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/support&#34;&gt;Support&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated my &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/cv&#34;&gt;CV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consequence of quick weather transition,
from hot mornings to rainy afternoons,
conjures an unexplainable feeling of dread within.
I&amp;rsquo;d like to blame the weather for this feeling,
but I&amp;rsquo;m sensing that it has something to do with the state of my mental health as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gloomy weather is now more frequent than sun shiny days.
Nothing to worry about, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except that I heard of two deaths already in a span of 60 minutes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/john-mcafee-found-dead-prison-after-spanish-court-allows-extradition-2021-06-23/&#34;&gt;John McAfee was found dead in prison&lt;/a&gt;, and by suicide according to reports;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/23/asia/philippines-benigno-noynoy-aquino-dies-intl-hnk/index.html&#34;&gt;Noynoy Aquino, former PH president, dies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m neither a fan nor a hater of both.
But knowing about their unexpected deaths unexpectedly does wonders.
We should&amp;rsquo;ve accepted that.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>40-Kilometer Bike Route</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/39/</link>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added four new entries and two new one-liners in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to get to a small (less than ten pax) gathering,
I challenged myself to arrive and depart there on two-wheels,
fueled only by my will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way is around 20km.
A round trip is &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; death sentence for an inexperienced rider like me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good thing: it&amp;rsquo;s a Sunday, and there are almost no cars on the road.
Dashing past me were lanky bikers in much better form,
great danes on roadies.
My &amp;ldquo;long&amp;rdquo; distance starter pack:
helmet, safety vest with reflectors, tail light, comfy clothes, one-liter water bottle, a bag full of other goodies, and maybe a 700kg mountain bike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bad thing:
I knew it would rain; the sky wore parking lot colors on dusk.
About one-third of the way back home,
it started pouring heavily, and I was already worn out.
In my exhaustion,
I decided to bike through it.
WRONG MOVE&amp;mdash;my backpack was already full,
it got heavier as everything got wet.
It was a literal torture to breathe through my wet mask,
which I had to pull slightly down just so I don&amp;rsquo;t collapse in the middle of the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will I do it again?
&lt;em&gt;Yes&lt;/em&gt;.
But I&amp;rsquo;ll be in much better shape for next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Added new ways to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/support&#34;&gt;Support&lt;/a&gt; me.
Check it in your free time!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added a few lines in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/site&#34;&gt;Site&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I forgot to mention that we have a recent post over at &lt;a href=&#34;https://arawseekers.github.io&#34;&gt;Araw Seekers&lt;/a&gt; blog, a recipe of chocolate crinkles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt; project, I have added nine new entries, and ten new one-liners.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In lieu of updating my Support page to include hardware,
I&amp;rsquo;d like to repost here what I posted in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://groups.freecycle.org/QuezonPH&#34;&gt;Freecycle&lt;/a&gt; forum.
This post will mirror those I submitted in the forum,
lightly edited and translated to English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ibm-thinkpad-t40&#34;&gt;IBM Thinkpad T40&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking for IBM Thinkpad T40, accessories, parts, power adapter.
I actually have a T40 here, but when it was given to me,
some parts are not working properly.
I&amp;rsquo;m looking to refurbish it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, I&amp;rsquo;m looking for these items/parts in good and working condition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keyboard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;battery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;power adapter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RAM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I successfully refurbished the laptop,
I will either donate it, or sell for a reasonable price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;apple-power-adapter&#34;&gt;Apple Power Adapter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m looking for a working &lt;strong&gt;Magsafe 1 L-type Power Adapter&lt;/strong&gt; for old A1181 Macbook model.
The Macbook itself needs refurbishing, but in
order to do that, I need a reliable power adapter.
If you have one lying around that&amp;rsquo;s working,
I&amp;rsquo;m willing to discuss a method of transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fixing Automatic Top-load Washing Machine</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/37/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 16 May 2021 05:02:30 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/37/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our home, we dedicate at least one day of the weekend for washing our clothes;
two if we&amp;rsquo;ve accumulated so many laundry during the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a special weekend, though.
It&amp;rsquo;s my turn to do the laundry this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I load the dirty clothes into the tub of the top-load LG Fuzzy Logic 6.0, put detergent,
and turn the power on,
the machine wakes up and begins its job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One only needs to set up a program for the batch,
and after pressing Start,
one can leave it to do other things.
It has a distinct beeping to notify the operator that the laundry is done,
and the clothes are ready to be hung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on this special weekend,
&lt;strong&gt;it beeps an error-sounding alarm,
accompanied by the blinking of two indicator lights, WASH and SPIN&lt;/strong&gt;.
It doesn&amp;rsquo;t proceed further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;development&#34;&gt;Development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several things go through my mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to pay for a technician&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to repair this machine;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to buy a new one;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to go to a laundry shop, and pay for their services;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to manually wash the laundy by hand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These four thoughts converge to a single one:
I need to repair it myself, hopefully before the day ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have little knowledge when it comes to repairing washing machines.
So I went to the internet to look for possible solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;troubleshooting&#34;&gt;Troubleshooting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could be the water sensor.
This device detects the water level,
and relays this information to the control board for processing.
However, if this is the problem,
it should be that all the indicator lights for WATER LEVEL that are blinking.
I know this, because when I disconnect the wires of the water sensor,
this is what happened, plus the error beeps.
For good measure, I also test the water sensor&amp;rsquo;s continuity with my digital multimeter:
it&amp;rsquo;s still in good condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could be the capacitor.
Capacitors in washing machines,
and usually in other appliances with motors in them,
jump-starts the motor from its steady-state to rotation.
They&amp;rsquo;re tricky to access,
usually from the underside, or from the back.
In this machine, the capacitor is rated at 8.5 μF (micro-farads).
Still with my digital multimeter, I probe the capacitors terminals.
The reading on the multimeter increases steadily up to a point
where the capacitor discharges, and returns to 0 (zero);
and begin climbing again.
This means that the capacitor, too, is in good condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the two most common problems to check,
but they are both functional.
What&amp;rsquo;s next?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;twist&#34;&gt;Twist&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one is exempted from entropy.
Perhaps this is why many professions prioritize safety.
This is especially true when human lives are involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A safety program can last from 40 hours up to a &lt;em&gt;lifetime&lt;/em&gt;.
Let&amp;rsquo;s face it:
no amount of license or certificate can guarantee 100% safety.
Once we accept that we don&amp;rsquo;t know what we don&amp;rsquo;t know,
learning becomes imperative and not as hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We open ourselves to continuously adapt to the challenges.
We can suspend our biases, if only for a while,
to hopefully design better safety mechanisms in our daily technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In automatic top-load washing machines,
either of these two will happen when the lid is open:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spinning won&amp;rsquo;t start when in steady-state; or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spinning will stop when in the middle of spinning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This safety feature is implemented with the use of
magnets&amp;mdash;one is placed on the lid cover,
and the other near the control board.
Only when these two magnets are aligned and interacting,
i.e. when the lid is closed, will the control board
allow the spinning to start
(or be resumed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isya tells me this info, which she got from a technician
who repaired this machine when it broke down years ago.
A few search results also raises the chance that this could be it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnet is the key.
The old one in the lid is lost, and we need a new hack.
But where to place it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My trial-and-error testing involves starting the WASH process,
until it error-beeps.
Then I try sliding the fridge magnet along the inside edge of the control board.
The beeping stops when the magnet reaches the center.
It then proceeds with the WASH process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I test this with other modes (RINSE, SPIN), and the same thing happens:
error beeping stops when the magnet is at the center.
It then proceeds with whatever mode it&amp;rsquo;s on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I permanently install the magnet on the lid cover
using superglue and baking soda.
Hopefully it sticks for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I can go on with the laundry hassle-free.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Fridge Magnet solves the issue. Now where&amp;rsquo;s the manual?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, it&amp;rsquo;s Sunday.
It&amp;rsquo;s unlikely that someone is available.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tyler Durden&#39;s Empty Seat</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/36/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 15 May 2021 03:01:31 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/36/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added a new project: &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/bujo&#34;&gt;My Bullet Journal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added five new entries to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To console myself amid the combined power of heat and boredom,
I opened the book &lt;em&gt;Fight Club&lt;/em&gt; and started reading the first few chapters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reminded me of Tyler Durden in the movie adaptation.
Many of those wanting to get ripped almost always consider Brad Pitt&amp;rsquo;s
physique during this time to be &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; ultimate goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I bring this up not because of fitness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the film, when the narrator meets Tyler for the first time, it&amp;rsquo;s on a plane.
They&amp;rsquo;re seat mates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After watching it, I went back to this scene.
I thought, &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s not right.
If they&amp;rsquo;re one and the same person, then that must mean that the seat beside the narrator isn&amp;rsquo;t actually occupied.
And that&amp;rsquo;s not allowed in airplanes, right? To have empty seats?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to this conclusion based on an incomplete information.
Plus, at the time, I had never been &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; an plane to travel, domestically or internationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much, much later, my first job allowed me to fly to different locations within the country.
I noticed that sometimes, a flight didn&amp;rsquo;t get full.
Once or twice, a flight didn&amp;rsquo;t even reach 50% capacity!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing this now, I can say that it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; possible to sit and talk beside an imagined version of the self in a commercial flight to nowhere!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Added four new entries in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am now down with trying to make my own text editor, &lt;strong&gt;kilo&lt;/strong&gt;,
based on &lt;a href=&#34;https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
I have gained a bit of knowledge in C going through the tutorial.
But I need to do more projects in C.
Projects that I myself would be using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or at least, I need to look more into source codes of different projects,
and try to understand the design philosophy for each of them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to UnRAR files in Linux Command Line</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/34/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 05 May 2021 01:50:44 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/34/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added new sections in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/server&#34;&gt;Server&lt;/a&gt; project.
Also edited the wording so that voice is mostly first-person.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added new entries to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited this site&amp;rsquo;s footer.
Notably, I changed from 512KB Club to the leaner 250KB Club.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited some lines in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/alwayscarry&#34;&gt;Always Carry&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I had to download some file from the internet.
But said file is compressed into &lt;code&gt;.rar&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Debian packages, &lt;code&gt;sudo apt install unrar&lt;/code&gt; won&amp;rsquo;t work anymore because it &amp;ldquo;is missing, has been obsoleted, or is only available from another source.&amp;rdquo;
I don&amp;rsquo;t deal with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;rsquo;s my workaround.
The following assumes you&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; have a Debian-like Linux 64-bit distro,
and are comfortable with the terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-unrar-workaround&#34;&gt;My UnRAR Workaround&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get RAR archiver from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm&#34;&gt;RARLAB Archiver&lt;/a&gt;.
You can either:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go their website, and click on the link that matches your system; or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter in the terminal:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl -LO https://www.rarlab.com/rar/rarlinux-x64-6.0.1.tar.gz
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that at the time of writing, the current version is &lt;code&gt;6.0.1&lt;/code&gt;.
Be sure to check the site for latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to the folder where it got downloaded to.
Use &lt;code&gt;tar&lt;/code&gt; to extract the files&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;tar -xvzf rarlinux-x64-6.0.1.tar.gz
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;-x&lt;/code&gt; option means extracts the file/s from tar&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;-v&lt;/code&gt; option means verbose, to see the extraction progress&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;-z&lt;/code&gt; option decompresses all the files within, if any&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;-f&lt;/code&gt; option indicates the filename you&amp;rsquo;ll work on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go into the extracted folder.
It should have a &lt;code&gt;Makefile&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;rar&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;unrar&lt;/code&gt; executables, among other files.
Run &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd rar/
sudo make
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will copy the executables to the &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/bin&lt;/code&gt; and is now available to the user (you!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to extract the &lt;code&gt;.rar&lt;/code&gt; file you got there:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;unrar e legallyDownloadedFile.rar
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt; option means extract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m actually talking to my future self.
This is my notes.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Heat</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/33/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 02 May 2021 10:55:38 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/33/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed the status of &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt; project to &amp;ldquo;on-going.&amp;rdquo;
This is because I&amp;rsquo;m now in the slow and long process of migrating some of the posts from my old Tumblr blog to this site.
Ten new (old) entries are up.
Now, excuse while I cringe at my old writing style.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://openbsd.org&#34;&gt;OpenBSD 6.9&lt;/a&gt; has been available since May Day.
I just updated my soon-to-be &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/server&#34;&gt;Server&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;code&gt;sysupgrade&lt;/code&gt;.
A nice experience indeed.
Still getting around to setting that up, though, so there&amp;rsquo;s that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m having trouble with setting up the server.
I couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out the DNS thingy.
The afternoon heat doesn&amp;rsquo;t help.
There&amp;rsquo;s barely a moment to focus or reflect on any of the things that I&amp;rsquo;m currently on, because of the heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global temperature is likely to be like this.
It might even get worse each year.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Unlearning Inefficiency</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/32/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 24 Apr 2021 09:16:02 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/32/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/alwayscarry&#34;&gt;Always Carry&lt;/a&gt; project.
It&amp;rsquo;s been recently rebranded (FKA Always Carry A Book) and relaunched, so please check out the online shop:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://alwayscarry.netlify.app&#34;&gt;https://alwayscarry.netlify.app&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added new sections to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/server/&#34;&gt;Server&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Footnote &amp;ldquo;highlighting&amp;rdquo; is now just changing the &lt;code&gt;font-weight&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;bold&lt;/code&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s short post is all about learning,
or at least, my attempt at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to think I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading more these days.
I know it&amp;rsquo;s important to keep up with the times, but at the same time,
taking a break cannot be overlooked!
Information unused can and will occupy unnecessary mental space, which is just too precious today to be misused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I also think that I may not be reading the most useful bodies of text to me.
Though that&amp;rsquo;s not saying that every input &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be useful.
We humans tend to ruin a lot of things, including ourselves, through the endless pursuit of optimization.
Sometimes, it&amp;rsquo;s okay to be inefficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Everything in moderation,&amp;rdquo; Oscar Wilde said, &amp;ldquo;including moderation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning new things creates new insights.
Unlearning some old ones can also connect different ideas, as one unclogs the path from bad data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here&amp;rsquo;s a free idea:
Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be great to buy and sit on the &lt;code&gt;yellowcab.pizza&lt;/code&gt; domain?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sample text becomes bold when you click from the footnote reference.
It returns to regular font weight when you return.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/31/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited the CSS code block example in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/site/&#34;&gt;Site&lt;/a&gt; project.
I also edited some sections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited some sections in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/alwayscarry/&#34;&gt;Always Carry&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/disclaimer&#34;&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/a&gt; now has its own dedicated page.
It can be accessed from the footer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The following line was added to the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag to remove icon and prevent the browser from trying to retrieve it: &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link rel=&amp;quot;icon&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;data:&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved navigation in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/log/&#34;&gt;Log&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/project&#34;&gt;Projects&lt;/a&gt; menus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed internal links.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added &lt;code&gt;{margin-right:auto; margin-left:auto}&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;figure&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;figurecaption&lt;/code&gt;.
Images should now be the same as the width of the body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/blogroll/&#34;&gt;Blogroll&lt;/a&gt; on Index.
It&amp;rsquo;s likely I&amp;rsquo;ll add more to this list in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How long does it take for something to come to fruition?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Action, and its many variations, forces the many instances of being to move about and affect one another.
Yet, in spite of knowing this, I still must be creative in preserving my motivation.
I must plan my actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But planning itself requires motivation.
Before a day even begins, I must have already addressed this feedback loop.
Tricky, I know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most days, I&amp;rsquo;d like to think that my actions will converge in a future point;
and this point being a situation which Life becomes a meaningful one to live.
It sounds individualistic, now that I&amp;rsquo;m examining the words outside my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still going through the motions.
I hope to have a clean act, because neatness advertises ability, they say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, &lt;strong&gt;Act I&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/30/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What are you looking forward to this year 2021?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It differs from person to person, &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We here have been looking forward to the opening of two new LRT-2 stations, the nearest being Masinag Station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/778277/lrt2-east-extension-to-commence-ops-on-april-27/story/&#34;&gt;According to DOTr&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;] LRT2 East Extension project will begin to serve commuters on April 27, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know better, though, than to blindly trust such press release.
You see, the opening of said stations has been postponed for a few times now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost every construction and project manager I know expect that a project never meets its target completion date.
A slight slide in schedule is acceptable, but months of delay?
Somebody has got to start explaining.
For projects that affect the public, though, we know better than to expect Someone explaining the full report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of unforessen factors (e.g. a global pandemic) could suddenly come into play, effectively throwing a wrench into the gears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 is a great excuse for delayed projects, used by both well-meaning and malicious actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having ranting all that, I&amp;rsquo;ll still try to extend my patience, waiting for public transportation projects to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;and what of space transportation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt;, the first &lt;a href=&#34;https://cowboybebop.fandom.com/wiki/Astral_Gate&#34;&gt;Astral Gate&lt;/a&gt; is slated to be built in 2021, this year!
Looking forward to this as well, although I expect that there will be delays in completion.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Two-kilometer Bike Errand</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/29/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 05 Apr 2021 22:12:36 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/29/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added new sections in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/server/&#34;&gt;Server&lt;/a&gt;.
That page is becoming a repository of notes that I&amp;rsquo;ve compiled during the process of setting up this server.
It comes in bits and pieces, but it&amp;rsquo;s coming along.
I&amp;rsquo;m still figuring it out how to implement some things in OpenBSD.
A new version might come out soon (OpenBSD &lt;strong&gt;6.9&lt;/strong&gt;, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t I like that?).
We&amp;rsquo;ll see what happens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removed the Index logo for now.
Replaced it with a fancy ASCII art text.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cycling around may well be the most efficient way to get around without resorting to fossil fuels.
An able-bodied person will certainly benefit from knowing how to ride a bike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as the Pandemic continues to do harm, cycling, as compared to simply walking, reduces the time spent outdoors, while still having some semblance of physical exercise, unlike driving in a car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, an errand comes up:
one of our cats need a special food that&amp;rsquo;s likely available only in a mall about two kilometers away.
We veer away from public transpo right now, so on to the bike!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seasoned cyclists would claim that a two-kilometer run is easy, and I would likely agree.
But I&amp;rsquo;m not a seasoned cyclist yet.
And did I mention that we live in hill/mountain?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to ECQ, there are few cars in the road, which can only be a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back home is a slow-burn of two-kilometer ascent.
The weight of the mountain bike (made of granite, by the way) plus the cat food only added to the burden.
And while it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the scorching midday sun that we have had the displeasure of weathering the past few days, 30-something degrees Celsius while cycling uphill with load wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly leisurely either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all of that, I wrote this after taking a bath:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tired, but reinvigorated w/ my bike errand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Footnotes will now be highlighted in yellow&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; when you click on them.
See for yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was certain I had several dreams the night before.
During those fleeting moments of half-asleep in the middle of the night, I said to myself that I must remember these dreams in the morning so I could write them down.
When morning came, I remembered nothing of them.
Only the feeling that there were some things &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dreams can be nostalgic, in my opinion.
In my experience, mine have been an amalgam of many experiences, or at least the gist of each.
Mostly, they are just flash fiction typewritten on a fragile old parchment that promptly begins to disintegrate the moment you decide you should store them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am spending&amp;mdash;or did spend, as I&amp;rsquo;m writing this in the evening&amp;mdash;my birthday under Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ), this administration&amp;rsquo;s euphimism for lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, I also spent my birthday last year under ECQ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ano-ang-handa&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ano ang handa?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2020&#34;&gt;2020&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AM Food&lt;/strong&gt;: peanut butter and goober in pandesal, coffee, mixed nuts&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;PM Food&lt;/strong&gt;: spaghetti, cheesy frankfurter, lemon water, mixed nuts, Kettle Brew&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2021&#34;&gt;2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AM Food&lt;/strong&gt;: chai masala, corn muffin&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;PM Food&lt;/strong&gt;: rice, sinigang na salmon, coffee, honey-glazed doughnut, super dry beer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be highlighted if you just click on the note reference above.
This helps you, the reader, know which note the text is referring to.
The highlight will disappear once you click on the backlink, the one at the end of this note.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Week 11 of 2021</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/27/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 22 Mar 2021 00:48:28 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/27/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because there&amp;rsquo;s no creative way to title this post.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added new sections in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/server/&#34;&gt;Server&lt;/a&gt;.
Yes, kids, it&amp;rsquo;s happening.
Or at least, bit by bit, I&amp;rsquo;m getting into it&amp;mdash;
my homebrewed server is coming along.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added some lines and a footnote in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/site/&#34;&gt;Site&lt;/a&gt; about Pandoc.
An image is also removed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;and-now-the-news&#34;&gt;And now, the news&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I changed the DNS for this site, something went off:
the site goes down every update, only to go back up in a few hours.
I&amp;rsquo;ll be fiddling still with my DNS registrar, but it is what it is for the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some time this week, the news of 7,000+ new COVID cases got many people alarmed.
As of this writing, we are yet again, in a lockdown.
I think they are calling this either &amp;ldquo;soft MECQ&amp;rdquo; or a &amp;ldquo;hard GCQ.&amp;rdquo;
One meme thinks this is &amp;ldquo;poor governance&amp;rdquo; and I tend to agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try to limit my errands outdoors.
Honestly, it&amp;rsquo;s not hard to stay put.
With both the pandemic and the sun still wreaking havoc, I&amp;rsquo;m inclined to not venture away from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to the newly installed &lt;em&gt;Diablo 2: Lord of Destruction&lt;/em&gt; game running atop Wine&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
So much nostalgia.
Running through the game with a Fire Druid build, if that matters to anyone.
Free time made me install the game, but I&amp;rsquo;m only partly to blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for my body, I&amp;rsquo;m fully recovered now&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
I must remember to do warm-ups and cool-downs before and after workout respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the recovery, though, I did have breakouts.
It&amp;rsquo;s a spell, I think, activated at the time of lethargy.
My body reminds me that it didn&amp;rsquo;t evolve through millenia of struggle just to slouch indoors.
But I&amp;rsquo;m only partly to blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wine (&amp;ldquo;Wine Is Not an Emulator&amp;rdquo;) is a compatibility layer capable of running Windows applications on several POSIX-compliant operating systems, such as Debian, the one in my machine right now.
More info: &lt;a href=&#34;https://winehq.org&#34;&gt;https://winehq.org&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muscle pains had afflicted my thighs for days when I attempted to do pistol squats without properly learning the technique.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What D&amp;D Character Am I?</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/26/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 17 Mar 2021 14:52:37 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/26/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New URL! This site is now &lt;code&gt;https://ohio.araw.xyz&lt;/code&gt;.
Since it&amp;rsquo;s still hosted on Github Pages, &lt;code&gt;https://oqolarte.github.io&lt;/code&gt; will still work, and will redirect here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&#34;http://easydamus.com/alignmenttest.html&#34;&gt;this alignment test&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;m likely&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chaotic-good&#34;&gt;Chaotic Good&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A chaotic good character acts as his conscience directs him with little regard for what others expect of him.
He makes his own way, but he&amp;rsquo;s kind and benevolent.
He believes in goodness and right but has little use for laws and regulations.
He hates it when people try to intimidate others and tell them what to do.
He follows his own moral compass, which, although good, may not agree with that of society.
Chaotic good is the best alignment you can be because it combines a good heart with a free spirit.
However, chaotic good can be a dangerous alignment when it disrupts the order of society and punishes those who do well for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Scent in Memory</title>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added my email adress at the end of each project to welcome any recommendations to improve each of them.
Right now, I haven&amp;rsquo;t implemented a commenting system for this website.
Perhaps I don&amp;rsquo;t intend to.
Email is the only way to receive feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Links&amp;rsquo; color changes at cursor hover.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting research about why odors trigger powerful memories&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[S]mells are a profound part of memory, and odors connect us to especially important memories in our lives, often connected to loved ones&amp;hellip;
Odors connect us to important memories that transport us back to the presence of those people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is nothing new to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been triggered by various scents in random places.
Every time, I&amp;rsquo;m transported to the past by nostalgia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Qualitative Research</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/24/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 13 Mar 2021 15:16:14 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/24/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;How else do you spend an afternoon other than answering &lt;a href=&#34;https://flyeronthewall.wordpress.com/about/about-yourself/&#34;&gt;questions from the internet&lt;/a&gt;?
Not all questions from that questionnaire made here.
I picked the ones that I may have an interesting answer to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you take flyers when people in public places offer them in your direction?
If yes, what do you do with them afterwards?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Only when they shove it to me, in which case I dispose the flyer immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your first memory of using the Internet?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A grade-school classmate invited me to check out some online games in Cartoon Network&amp;rsquo;s website.
The game involved the then-popular Teen Titans.
I was amazed at how easy it was to &amp;ldquo;access the internet.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the last thing you think you failed at?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I failed to consider the difficulty of getting into hobby electronics.
Having said that, I&amp;rsquo;m still unsuccessful in repairing a broken Apple Magsafe 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isn&amp;rsquo;t there something else you should be doing right now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I think it&amp;rsquo;s called &amp;ldquo;looking for a job&amp;rdquo; but today is Saturday.
The headhunters are resting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If this questionnaire were to have a title, what should it be?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Qualitative Research&amp;mdash;but only because I find it to be an ironic reflection of this task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was the last thing you read that ruined you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Never Let Me Go&lt;/em&gt; by Kazuo Ishiguro.
It ruined me in both good and bad way.
One of my favorite dystopians that, in my opinion, not only is chilling but is also depressing.
I also watched the movie, which is a good adaptation, in my opinion, of the novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who or what comes into your mind when you hear the name Agnes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Agnes&amp;rdquo; could be a motherly character from a prime time telenovela played by Agot Isidro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Vague Titles</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/23/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 12 Mar 2021 00:41:40 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/23/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited some sections in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/site/&#34;&gt;Site&lt;/a&gt;.
Also, I just learned that when writing in Markdown, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to put the footnotes at the end of the document!
When Hugo converts &lt;code&gt;.md&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;.html&lt;/code&gt;, it automatically places them at the end&amp;hellip;?!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited a line in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori/&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Recent Years, I always dreamed of having a vague title for myself, like Designer or Consultant.
Something that I can claim.
Or something that I can only hope to be, depending on who&amp;rsquo;s asking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But never Influencer, yuck!
Although, when you think of it, one (in)directly &lt;em&gt;influences&lt;/em&gt; people, places, and/or things when one &lt;em&gt;designs&lt;/em&gt;, or when one is &lt;em&gt;consulted&lt;/em&gt; for their expertise.
In reality, my dislike is more directed towards self-branded Influencers who flock social media like Instagram and/or Tiktok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, that&amp;rsquo;s not to say I like having a title.
Filipinos, especially, like to have so many titles affixed to their legal names.
Who can blame them when doing so gives the illusion of having more opportunities?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Productivity Conflicts</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/22/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 10 Mar 2021 10:46:08 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/22/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lightly adjusted the color scheme for dark-themed devices. Also
(ruthlessly?) pruned the CSS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added a brief explainer on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/site/&#34;&gt;Site&lt;/a&gt; about the now-added
northeast arrows on external links.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past few weeks, my to-do list has hounded me to clean and repaste
Ador&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This should be done maybe twice a year to maintain the
operating temperature within the motherboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PastMe scheduled this task for Feb 2021, but I kept postponing it, until
today. Ador&amp;rsquo;s fan had been in overdrive the last few days. Add to that
the unusual heat coming off from its left side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, after the task, it&amp;rsquo;s back to normal levels; Ador has been quiet
since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m investigating why something in my to-do list is able to &amp;ldquo;hound&amp;rdquo; me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it stems from the social pressure that I, a participant of my
environment, must produce something of value, to give something back. It
directly conflicts with my &lt;em&gt;desire&lt;/em&gt; to do nothing. Or rather, be able to
just sit and think, and still be worry-free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unemployment, in my case, opens new ways to be productive, I should
remind myself that. It allows me to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/di-why/&#34;&gt;look into projects&lt;/a&gt; that
I might not have if I was working. This, however, is predicated by the
fact that I have some sort of &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20240526151750/https://katiescarlettneedsmoney.com/4-strategies-you-can-use-to-build-an-emergency-fund/&#34;&gt;emergency fund&lt;/a&gt;
saved up. This fund buys me time to be worry-free. If my calculations
remain correct for the foreseeable future, I have between 8-12 months
worth of living expenses to burn through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added a long-ago completed project, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/imbentori/&#34;&gt;Imbentori&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compressed the site&amp;rsquo;s logo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After watching and rewatching videos on how to repair Apple&amp;rsquo;s Magsafe Power Adapter 1
(not sure what the official name is),
I decided to actually try repairing the thing, because I need it to work:
when the MacBook it came with was given to me, it had no battery.
It would boot directly from the power adapter, if only there&amp;rsquo;s a working one around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patience is a different skill set, in my opinion.
But I may be setting the bar low here for calling it a skill set.
Isn&amp;rsquo;t it a Virtue?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Decadent Lethargy</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/20/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 05 Mar 2021 07:24:29 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/20/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited one or two lines in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/support/&#34;&gt;Support&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added a page, called &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/di-why/&#34;&gt;Ideas of Possible Projects&lt;/a&gt;, where such list is found.
Right now, the page can be accessed through the Support page, this log, and by memory (adding &lt;code&gt;/di-why&lt;/code&gt; at the end of the base URL).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added Dan Luu&amp;rsquo;s blog as another inspiration for this &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/site&#34;&gt;Site&lt;/a&gt;.
Also added a service for those who may want to subscribe to RSS by email.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed the site&amp;rsquo;s logo to something&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;larger&lt;/em&gt;.
I used the &lt;a href=&#34;https://100r.co/site/dotgrid.html&#34;&gt;Hundred Rabbit&amp;rsquo;s Dotgrid&lt;/a&gt; tool to create it, which in my opinion is great!
Expect that I will play with drawing software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the Index, my CV can now be viewed as a page in this website without having to donwload the PDF.
I also updated a line in the footer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it&amp;rsquo;s getting harder to focus one thing at a time in this Age of Information.
I know, because I suffer from the same problem day in and day out.
Not much to it, really.
I use the term &amp;ldquo;suffer&amp;rdquo; but it feels more like decadent lethargy.
&lt;em&gt;If you can do the same thing with less effort, do it!&lt;/em&gt;
I often tell myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same vein, could being lazy, and possibly helping others settle into their own brand of Laziness, be a career path?
Of course, it has to be rebranded, like:
&lt;strong&gt;Help people get the most useful {info, thing, experience, XYZ} in the shortest time possible.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep on reading and hearing about this Pomodoro technique for years now.
Perhaps, it&amp;rsquo;s a viable solution to my waning and waxing attention span.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyperconnectivity allows us to access different people, different stuff from different points most of the time, and yet it can&amp;rsquo;t necessarily nourish us.
Is it more likely that it instead drains us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is March now.
Heat starts to become unbearable.
We&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to have an aircon unit in our room, and today it is now installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who would have thought that we&amp;rsquo;re nearing the anniversary of a lockdown?
To commemorate this wonderful event, we&amp;rsquo;ve downloaded Katamari Damacy on Isya&amp;rsquo;s old/new laptop.
I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of completing the game 100%.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Redistribution</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/19/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Feb 2021 11:59:16 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/19/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added new sections to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/server/&#34;&gt;Server&lt;/a&gt; project.
Still haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten around to it, but I will soon.
I have to, now that I have a domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added Paypal link in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/support/&#34;&gt;Support&lt;/a&gt; page.
Also inserted a better pitch in there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited a footnote in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/site/&#34;&gt;Site&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minor edit of the footer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a society much better than this one, many things are readily available to everyone.
People meet their basic needs.
I imagine they are freer in their actions, in that they don&amp;rsquo;t (need/feel the need to) limit others&amp;rsquo; freedoms.
But this isn&amp;rsquo;t that society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, support the people you want and can, in any method, legal and/or moral, you know how.
&lt;em&gt;Redistribute&lt;/em&gt; everything else accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>We Want a Maggot-Free Cake</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/18/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 22 Feb 2021 08:05:17 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/18/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added a way for readers (are there any?) to support me, found in this page: &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/support/&#34;&gt;Support&lt;/a&gt; (via Liberapay).
To be as less obnoxious about it as possible, this link will only be at the end of each Project page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed my email address in the Index.
After getting a domain from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.epik.com&#34;&gt;Epik&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; registrar and setting up an email server with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.migadu.com&#34;&gt;Migadu&lt;/a&gt;, I now have a custom email address.
In the future, I will also set one up for Isya.
In the meantime, please send your mails to my new address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also in Index, edited a few lines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, our neighbors gifted us with plenty of food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One gave a tofu-version of sisig.
This lady was delighted to know that too I&amp;rsquo;m a tofu fan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another neighbor brought us &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; different servings of food:
chocolate cake and macaroni fruit salad.
The latter we found weird&amp;mdash;who adds macaroni in fruit salads?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cake&amp;mdash;the cake is a lie.
Good thing that Isya first inspected it before eating a slice.
The cake is full of maggots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had to throw it out, and by that I mean send it to the compost bin.
Give it one last purpose, at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, that we&amp;rsquo;ve been primed to desire a chocolate cake, ordering one, maggot-free, was the next most logical step.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/17/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated the CV. Reduced it to one page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed the status of &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/encode/&#34;&gt;Encoding&lt;/a&gt; project
from &lt;strong&gt;on-going&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;done&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://duckduckgo.com/l/?uddg=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FTsundoku&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tsundoku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (積ん読) becomes our mode of expressing ourselves here.
How we decorate the blank spaces with books of various interests.
It&amp;rsquo;s because the many books that we acquire that we have not touched and are piled up together are for sale at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://alwayscarry.netlify.app&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always Carry A Book&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a mantra that we follow only when it&amp;rsquo;s convenient, and less than one kilogram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can only gloss over them as we put them up on the store one by one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the many more books that already have that aren&amp;rsquo;t for sale, well, they shall remain dusty until we find time to pick them up.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pressing Issues on a Valentine&#39;s Day</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/16/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 14 Feb 2021 07:24:37 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/16/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added a site logo.
It&amp;rsquo;s actually just scaled vector graphics (SVG) coded with HTML.
Experimental at the moment.
I&amp;rsquo;ll likely change that into something more artsy in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited a few lines in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/encode/&#34;&gt;Encoding&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited some parts in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/site&#34;&gt;This Site&lt;/a&gt;/ project.
I added some notes about my new found tool, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jarun/imgp&#34;&gt;imgp&lt;/a&gt;, with the help of which I&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;redid an image in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/mercipod/&#34;&gt;iPod Upgrade&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removed the @tuta.io email from Index.
I don&amp;rsquo;t know why I can&amp;rsquo;t access Tutanota servers.
Something to do with my location?
In the meantime, @live.com.ph shall receive any emails.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A day like any other.
An okay day so far for a cat named Ming to look for love (or escape from hate) beyond the walls.
A perfect time to be hounded by pressing questions like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the realistic thing to do to not go hungry and be kicked out in the streets?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern answer: Get a job.
I prefer &amp;ldquo;At least be useful to people,&amp;rdquo; but to be honest, consistently doing that takes effort and leads to burnout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not at all a bad day, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make a non-exhaustive list of what a bad day looks likes.
I like making lists.
Creating lists has a calming effect.
Anyway, specify a number of items in the list, that when met, will constitute a bad day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is also a great day to go against the grain, to have the guts to think independently of what&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;uso&lt;/em&gt;.
Some might suspect its edginess, but as long as hate isn&amp;rsquo;t promoted, it&amp;rsquo;s fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose a simple set of tunes to spaghettify to &lt;em&gt;en plein air&lt;/em&gt;, even if it&amp;rsquo;s unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bad Habit: Impatience</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/15/</link>

      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/15/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reworked the color of blockquotes on a dark-themed system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added background color to footnote (back) reference links, so they can be easily distinguished.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added a few emojis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have long since acknowledged my terri(ble/fic) demeanor.
I am (im)patient, it goes without saying, and I have to check myself constantly before doing something or opening my mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately, I have become more irritable towards myself, because of the petty mistakes that most likely go into flames, which I would then fan.&lt;br&gt;
No one should sustain this habit of self-depracating.
I know it&amp;rsquo;s unhealthy, and yet I do it, like eating fried meat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Society as a whole likes to drone over the shoulder to peek at the things I &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be doing but don&amp;rsquo;t.
Sometimes, it seems disappointed, but mostly, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t care.&lt;br&gt;
They don&amp;rsquo;t care in the sense that they can&amp;rsquo;t;
they don&amp;rsquo;t know me at all, so there&amp;rsquo;s really no big reason to.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Author to be laid off</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/14/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Feb 2021 01:14:22 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/14/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added new project &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/mercipod/&#34;&gt;iPod Classic Hard Drive Upgrade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minor adjustments in fonts and their sizes.
Does it improve the readability of the site?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to talk briefly about my current employment situation, which would end soon:
I would be officially out of work by this 12 Feb, and I think that&amp;rsquo;s fine.
An official excuse to be lethargic for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing is lined up at the momment.
The search goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s just that employers make sure that they do as much filtering as possible.
Some would inappropriately ask, &amp;ldquo;What self-improvement did you do during the lockdown?&amp;rdquo;
What they&amp;rsquo;re really asking is, &amp;ldquo;We are looking for people with the initiative to make themselves useful for profit-making. Are you one of them?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People need to slow down.
Don&amp;rsquo;t give in to the hustle culture, which is inherently toxic by nature anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Visiting Pagkakaisa</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/13/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Feb 2021 11:55:26 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/13/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removed a few sentences in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/site&#34;&gt;This Site&lt;/a&gt;, particularly those about my implied distaste towards JS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After more than a year of not making an appearance in our ancestral house in Pagkakaisa Street, Isya and I finally went there yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I was not too excited on going there for a number of things.
First, commuting via public transportation from Antipolo to Makati, even on a Sunday, is not easy.
Our travel time lasted around two hours, one way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And lastly, people there, my relatives, are heavy chain-smokers.
Perhaps, the next time that we&amp;rsquo;ll be there, we should wear (gas) masks indoors.
The smokescreen from their constantly burning cigarettes was so thick I could not see past an arm&amp;rsquo;s length.
I wish I was exagerrating.
Let&amp;rsquo;s not even go to how long that toxic fume sticks on your person.
Hours!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there we went, with or without incentives, because it&amp;rsquo;s been more than a year since I saw them.
We have more catching up to do.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Esmeris Farm</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/12/</link>

    alt=&#34;foliage, forest&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Imagine being surrounded by this&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to think that I was present the entire trip from Rizal to Laguna and back, that&amp;rsquo;s why I only manage to take a few photos.
In reality, the trip exhausted me and my companions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s literally a needed trip.
Each of us had expected something out of this, but it&amp;rsquo;s unclear whether we&amp;rsquo;re all okay with the outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sentimental music in city pop always puts me in place, especially when the setting blows cold, wet winds our way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Future will be chilling long after it has burned.
Every notion will have become useless by then, but it the meantime, any idea is worth arguing for so long as it makes perfect sense to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;music-that-reminds-me-of-this-time&#34;&gt;Music that reminds me of this time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artist&lt;/strong&gt;: Tatsuro Yamashita 山下達郎&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Album&lt;/strong&gt;: Pocket Music (1986)&lt;br&gt;
The aforementioned city pop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artist&lt;/strong&gt;: The Drums&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Album&lt;/strong&gt;: Portamento (2011)&lt;br&gt;
The music on our drive homebound.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/11/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed this site&amp;rsquo;s title, from &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;of somersaulting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;to oblique lair&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.
The latter is an anagram of my middle and surname.
I&amp;rsquo;d like to think that it emits a certain mystery that kind of misleads.
If that sounds like equine shite, maybe because it is.
Look up &amp;ldquo;anagram maker&amp;rdquo; on your favorite search engine if you&amp;rsquo;re into that kind of fun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added some new recommendations in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/encode/&#34;&gt;Encoding&lt;/a&gt; project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited some lines and addded footnotes in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/site/&#34;&gt;This Site&lt;/a&gt; project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New CSS for &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; blocks using &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/&#34;&gt;Hugo&amp;rsquo;s built-in syntax highlighting&lt;/a&gt;.
Currently, I am using the &lt;code&gt;monokai&lt;/code&gt; theme.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added new section in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/alwayscarry/&#34;&gt;Always Carry A Book Website&lt;/a&gt; project that briefly explains about a newly added search function feature using JavaScript. 😨&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated my CV using Pandoc.
It is now two pages long, so I may have to readjust the margins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is mostly changelog that I decided to post because this list is getting long enough.
No new interesting narratives for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, tomorrow, we scheduled a trip to Liliw.
We hope to see waterfalls and trees.
Maybe I can share some photo/s in the next post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all goes well, it would be my first long trip since the Pandemic started, and outside the capital at that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Added new project: &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/encode/&#34;&gt;Encoding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added some lines in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/site/&#34;&gt;This Site&lt;/a&gt; project, expounding more on the use of Hugo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower&amp;mdash;or, better yet, &lt;em&gt;eliminate&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;expectations.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;Wag (masyadong) umasa.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t use social media.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Iwasan na ang social media.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;100 grams of dry pasta per person; 1 teaspoon of salt per liter of pasta water.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;100 gramong pasta kada tao; 1 kutsaritang asin kada litro ng pinagpakuluan ng pasta.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t have kids.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Wag nang mag-anak.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember to be honest with yourself.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Maging tapat sa sarili.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember to make time for your loved ones.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Wag mong kalimutang maglaan ng oras para sa iyong mga minamahal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember your loved ones, no matter where or when they are.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Ano bang alam ko kundi ang mangulila?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that the mask goes over the nose.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Tandaan na dapat matakpan ng face mask ang ilong.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/9/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added new sections to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/alwayscarry/&#34;&gt;Always Carry A Book Website&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minor edit on the footer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added some blurbs on the Index, like adding a separate email for work-related stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edited title for &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/log/index.xml&#34;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to think that I&amp;rsquo;m taking it easy.
By having some personal projects that I enjoy doing, going through the motions of the day becomes mentally stimulating.
To be honest, I don&amp;rsquo;t see myself monetizing a side project any time soon.
But, anytime soon, that could change because of some interjection of Randomness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe in these small pursuits I won&amp;rsquo;t affect anything.
At least I can give &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt; a headache by not merely doing what they think I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to do.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Growing Old</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/8/</link>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listed new project: &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/alwayscarry/&#34;&gt;Always Carry A Book website&lt;/a&gt;.
It&amp;rsquo;s currently under construction, but feel free to check either the post, or the website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed background color of a blockquote.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed some wording in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/site/&#34;&gt;This Site&lt;/a&gt; project, something about my opinion on not having JavaScript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hirap tumanda.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s already evening as I type this out.
Just got home from Isya&amp;rsquo;s Inay&amp;rsquo;s home in Marikina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ate Emelyn (not sure of the spelling or if I heard it right) and I prepared the lunch.
According to survey, the food was good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to grow old?
Does it mean wisdom?
Does it mean forfeiting everyday human function in order to live longer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impatience of one elderly seems to ripple to every person trying to take care of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bless all the caretakers!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Crises and New Fear</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/7/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 31 Dec 2020 13:48:48 +0800</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;No major updates for this site.
I haven&amp;rsquo;t been doing anything lately for research.
Of course, here, &amp;ldquo;research&amp;rdquo; is what I call it.
Essentially, it&amp;rsquo;s me doing a deep dive into things that I&amp;rsquo;m currently interested in doing.
I may have already said that somewhere here before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be &amp;ldquo;looking for new opportunities&amp;rdquo; very soon.
In the interim, I have to ask myself how best to use my time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, I have installed a Debian-based distro in my machine.
The previous one, an Arch-based, acted up on a major update, and many things stopped working completely.
So much for trusting &amp;ldquo;bleeding edge.&amp;rdquo;
Good thing that most of the important things, including this blog&amp;rsquo;s files, are backed up safely somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is our suffering that brings us together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A line that I read &lt;a href=&#34;https://libcom.org/library/dispossessed-ursula-le-guin&#34;&gt;somewhere&lt;/a&gt;.
Which would ring true forevermore, except if nirvana is achieved.
And will that come, even a lesser version of it?
It&amp;rsquo;s hard to imagine to get lighter as we see the world as it is today,
with all of its supposed leaders continuously disappointing the rest of us dispossessed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>December Fugue</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/6/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 22 Dec 2020 22:46:44 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/6/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added some lines and footnotes to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/site/&#34;&gt;The Site&lt;/a&gt; project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added a new project: &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/server/&#34;&gt;Own Web Server&lt;/a&gt;. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing there yet except a few lines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minor edit of blurb on landing page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added yet another item on to-do list for The Site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added color to status on &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/project/&#34;&gt;Projects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many unwanted noise all around us.
It could be all ending soon, but there is no clue when.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holidays, unsurprisingly, are propelling people to go around and about, not minding the on-going pandemic.
Or perhaps, they do mind the risk;
it&amp;rsquo;s just that they&amp;rsquo;ve chosen to deal with it haphazardly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything seems to be back to normal, except this time, we now have to worry about getting COVID from anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything back to abnormal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solitude must be fought for nowadays, I think, or it will get drowned out by people who wouldn&amp;rsquo;t learn to be still, by things that won&amp;rsquo;t stop oscillating, and by the human mind that can&amp;rsquo;t settle with boredom.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed (again) the Creative Commons licensing, from &lt;a href=&#34;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/&#34;&gt;CC BY 4.0&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/&#34;&gt;CC BY-SA 4.0&lt;/a&gt;.
The addition here is &lt;em&gt;Share Alike&lt;/em&gt;.
The license still allows adaptations of my work to be shared, but this particular one &lt;em&gt;must be preserved&lt;/em&gt; during transit.
This should prevent others from copying/adapting my work &lt;em&gt;and then&lt;/em&gt; closing the free flow of information by slapping a different copyright license.
I also removed the icon.
All this nuisance, I hope that it matters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added my CV in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/&#34;&gt;Index&lt;/a&gt;, in case a prospective employer wanders in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added new segments to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/site&#34;&gt;The Site&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removed the navigation menu. The major sections can be accessed in the Index, and at the end of each Page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we visited Isya&amp;rsquo;s Inay&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; yesterday in Marikina, the lunch was already waiting for us.
Beef pochero did us in, but only enough to go through another helping in the evening&amp;rsquo;s partaking.
More enriching was their rice, imported from Abra up north of Luzon.
I have to know what it&amp;rsquo;s called, so we can scout it from nearby rice suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We watched Christopher Nolan&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt; after lunch.
Actually, Isya and I had already seen it a few days prior;
we&amp;rsquo;re just rewatching this to hopefully answer some of our questions the movie&amp;rsquo;s convoluted plot.
As you may know, Nolan&amp;rsquo;s films require more than just one viewing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, Isya and I are planning to watch another Nolan&amp;rsquo;s, &lt;em&gt;Interstellar&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inay&lt;/em&gt; is their term of endearment for their paternal grandmother.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Impostor Syndrome</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/4/</link>

      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/4/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed the date format in Log&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added another to-do for &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/site/&#34;&gt;The Site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now officially part of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://512kb.club&#34;&gt;512 KB Club&lt;/a&gt;.
You&amp;rsquo;re now reminded of this in the footer, lol!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like a fraud for not having accomplished anything significant, but I need to constantly remind myself that in all the worlds that I&amp;rsquo;ve been in, it&amp;rsquo;s okay for anyone to choose taking it slow whenever they can here and now, in this 2020-version of the World.
However, I hope to transcend this slump, of course, with the help of my loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lethargy is only a useful excuse when &amp;ldquo;used&amp;rdquo; against the backdrop of the already oppressive systems in place.
I know this, because this is the only thing I&amp;rsquo;m still getting good at, even before the Pandemic has &amp;ldquo;locked down&amp;rdquo; people in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this I mean, I hope to contribute to the society at large by the microtansactions of&amp;hellip; kindness? of goodness? that I&amp;rsquo;m still capable of manifesting, if that makes sense.
Who knows, that could be an interesting research and development?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>No Rush</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/3/</link>

&lt;li&gt;Replaced the Creative Commons Licensing from &lt;a href=&#34;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/&#34;&gt;CC BY-NC-SA&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/&#34;&gt;CC BY 4.0&lt;/a&gt;.
If I were to advocate for free flow of information, I must let others, including commercial institutions, be able to riff off of my work.
I only ask that they include my name in the footnotes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added some new sections to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/site/&#34;&gt;This Site&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removed the blurb on the landing page that said &amp;ldquo;I have no other social media accounts&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
That&amp;rsquo;s not really accurate.
What I don&amp;rsquo;t have are Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, and Instagram.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed &amp;ldquo;Last Update&amp;rdquo; logic in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/project/&#34;&gt;Projects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all learn that it takes a whole lot of time to get to know oneself.
A year&amp;rsquo;s worth of quasi-isolation seems to be enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A flare of imagination could trigger emotions never felt before, and to that person, this is their first time learning this thing about himself.
It could be wild, sometimes&amp;ndash;detrimental, even&amp;ndash;to not have the full scope of one&amp;rsquo;s being at one&amp;rsquo;s disposal for one&amp;rsquo;s perusal.
That&amp;rsquo;s also one of the main reasons why I started this blog: another attempt to understand myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can&amp;rsquo;t really just say to ourselves, &amp;ldquo;Be patient,&amp;rdquo; because the systems laid out in front of us are designed to burn us out.
Besides, it&amp;rsquo;s hard for me to remain patient when I&amp;rsquo;m constantly facing external pressures to Do Something Productive.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>And now, for something completely different</title>
      <link>https://ohio.araw.xyz/2/</link>

      <guid>https://ohio.araw.xyz/2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/&#34;&gt;This site&lt;/a&gt; is now live, hosted for the meantime in &lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com&#34;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also listed as a project. Learn more about the design philosophies &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohio.araw.xyz/site/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figured I needed to have an online presence again, one that I can call my own, far from the algorithms of major social networking sites.
But aside from that, the idea to have a personal site started when Isya, my partner, suggested that I continue with my post-graduate studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem, I said, is that I no longer think it&amp;rsquo;s something worth pursuing anymore.
I don&amp;rsquo;t think I can stomach the academia life, not that it&amp;rsquo;s glamorous to begin with anyway.
Besides, life is more interesting in fields beyond engineering, my background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I played with the notion of publishing my personal projects (they&amp;rsquo;re not many) online for everyone to study, scrutinize, make better, etc.
Let&amp;rsquo;s see if this method is any better than formally enrolling in a university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, today&amp;rsquo;s is Bonifacio&amp;rsquo;s day.
Not only that, it&amp;rsquo;s my Tita Bonnie&amp;rsquo;s 61st birthday.
&lt;em&gt;Ano kaya ang handa nila?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
