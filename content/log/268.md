## Pope Francis died

That is, a day after he met JD Vance, current vice president of USA.

Not much to say or feel, except the waves of headache and stomache pains
I had already been dealing with before this news came to me.

Elia Ayoub wrote a reflection related on this matter, on "[Ordo Amoris](https://www.hauntologies.net/p/ordo-amoris)"

## Day trip to & from Tanauan, Batangas

We visited Alex Silva, my partner's family friend, in Batangas, and over many servings of
carbs-loaded food, we exchanged ideas on appropriate technology, and
how:

- it can and does help in important aspects of lives, like mobility via
  [compact utility bikes](https://www.facebook.com/p/Compact-Utility-Bike-100063712492024/) (Facebook); and
- it can and does provide possible solutions in [building a home](/dream-house).

Our trip home was memorable. The bus driver was driving full-speed and
swerving left and right past the slower cars. Felt like we were flying
into our violent car-crash.

## Afternoon showers

Weather: crazy.

We joked that the City of Manila is
our local Mad Max city, but with this unpredictable weather, any city
can become Mad Max city.

So for some days now, we resorted to taking quick showers in the
afternoon, usually right after lunch. As soon as water wets skin, I say
to my bits, "Bits, be cool." They don't usually respond to my internal
screaming, though.
