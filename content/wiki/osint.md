OSINT is the collection and analysis of information from publicly
available sources to generate usable intelligence. It's commonly used to
support [cybersecurity](/cybersecurity) activities, like identifying
potential threats and vulnerabilities.

## Information vs intelligence

*Information* refers to the collection of raw data or facts about a
specific subject. *Intelligence*, on the other hand, refers to the
analysis of information to produce knowledge or insights that can be
used to support decision-making.

In other words, intelligence is derived from information through the
process of analysis, interpretation, and integration. Gathering
information and intelligence are both important aspects of
cybersecurity.

## Intelligence improves decision-making

In [security](/security), open-source information is used in a similar
way to gain insights into threats and vulnerabilities that can pose
risks to an organization.

OSINT plays a significant role in [information security](/infosec).

An organization's infosec team might utilize OSINT to
go to online forums and hacker communities for discussions about
emerging vulnerabilities. If they come across a forum post discussing a
newly discovered weakness in a popular software that the organization uses,
the team can quickly assess the risk, prioritize patching efforts, and
implement necessary safeguards to prevent an attack.

Here are some of the ways OSINT can be used to generate intelligence:

- To provide insights into cyber attacks
- To detect potential data exposures
- To [evaluate existing defenses](/defense-in-depth)
- To identify unknown vulnerabilities

Collecting intelligence is sometimes part of the
[vulnerability management](/vulnerability-management) process.
Security teams might use
OSINT to develop profiles of potential targets and make data driven
decisions on improving their defenses.
