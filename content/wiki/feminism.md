The struggle against [patriarchy](/patriarchy) is an essential part of class conflict,
as well as the struggle against state and capitalism.

## Problematic branches

However, some strains of feminists are problematic.

TERF
: Trans-exclusionary radical feminist. They reject that trans women are
not real women, and usually spew transphobic sentiments. TERFs
themselves reject the label, going so far as considering it a slur.
Instead, they opt for a more hushed version of "gender critical".

SWERF
: Sex worker exclusionary radical feminist, on the model of TERF. They
oppose the sex industry, usually viewing it as coercive or abusive of
the women involved. In so doing, they question the experiences of
sex-positive feminists, including those in the sex industry.

Scholars of gender studies have argued that the Venn diagram
between TERF and SWERF is one big circle.

## Sex

The under-representation of clitoris likely stems
from patriarchy's obsession to control clitoris-having people's bodies.

I admit that I'm not cliterate,
and that I'm slow in bridging the orgasm gap
between clitorises and penises.
