Religion, itself, is not bad. Maybe.

{{< toc >}}

## Intro

A more nuanced take would be, many religions---especially those that
have existed for thousands of years---have imparted nuggets of
wisdom that are still relevant today; their texts are filled with
verbose literature, of poems and proses. It has its own benefits when it
comes to influencing behavior. At least in Christianity, the only one
I'm familiar with, it tames the "iatrogenics of abundance" as observed
by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his book [*Antifragile*](/antifragile).
Meaning, at the core of Christianity,
[simple living](/simple-living) leads to a [healthier](/healthy)
and more fulfilling life---very different from the many offshoots that
has sprouted over the thousands of years of its existence.

## Leaders and Organizations

People use religion to maintain their self-image, or at least the idea
of themselves as "good." Often, they too use it to believe that their
actions are "good" even though they are objectively causing harm.
Religious leaders and organizations use religion as a cudgel and/or
carrot, weaponizing it against the vulnerable and using it to further
their own personal agendas. Used this way, religion becomes a barrier to
[accountability](/transformative-justice).

To remain pious, "priests"
(or [rigid activists](/joyful-militancy/#rigid-radicalism))
must introduce new moral high grounds to which they will set the current
standards.

Going back again to Christianity, the irony is that its biggest
institutions fail to realize that if they truly walked in the footsteps
of Jesus, any real persecution would likely come from within their own
institutions.

When those in power maintain the illusion of victimhood, they use it as
a mandate to further oppress and blame the marginalized. As Filipinos,
we cannot forget the three centuries of Spanish colonialism under which
this was done. It is a historical blind spot: Jesus was crucified by the
religious and political establishment of his time, not by the outcasts
or the faithless.

## Religion or cult?

"All religions are barriers to progress," Walden Bello observes,
especially if they devolve into cults that negatively affect people's
social standings.

Our society primes us for cult abuse through everyday institutions. Any
institution that relies on us submitting to authority, dismissing our
feelings and observations, isolating us, does this. It's no
wonder there are cults across the political spectrum.

Let's take the Holy Bible, for example. It represents the limited
knowledge of people of its time, trying to put mystical and/or spiritual
experiences into words.
This lack of clarity [leaves room for *a lot* of interpretation](/surrealism) for future generations of believers, even allowing some
of them to take advantage of other people's yearnings to put themselves
into positions of power.

## Christianity

In the book *The Dawn of Everything* by David Graeber and David Wengrow,
they talk about [Kondiaronk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kondiaronk),
a statesman of Wendat Nation in 17th Century Canada, who had dissed
Christianity and its hundreds of sects splintering into their own paths
of so-called truth. How can a god, all-knowing and all-powerful, would
willingly take on misery in the flesh, to save a single species, only
some of which were going to be rescued from hell?

## Good religion?

If your faith is compatible with the end goals of [revolution](/revolution),
that is, as long as you believe that dismantling hierarchies and
vertical structures, and working
towards ending inequality is in line with your teachings,
then there's no reason not to welcome this belief.
If you are standing up to the barriers even within your faith, then even
better.

The people saying that *all* religion is just toxic dogma need to check
themselves.

## Protestant Ethic

Protestant Ethic states that life is good only if one works hard, is
frugal, and has self-restraint. Poverty, the Ethic goes, is escapable;
it all depends on the individual's discipline and austerity. All this
does not factor in the external factors beyond one's control, like bad
luck, bad employers exploiting their labor, or bad economy, the pull of
all of which is *very* hard to escape.
