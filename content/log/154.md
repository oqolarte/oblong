My feelings toward December are usually *meh*, and this year, it's still
true. Thoughts when I was much younger are surfacing, and the world
around me checks their integrity. "Are these ideas still naive?" seems
to be the central theme that binds all the significant events this
month.

## On bandwidths for projects

Before I work on a [project](/project), I look at my mental bandwidth.

Many of my projects are in limbo because I may be in eternal
lethargy, [something](/imbentori/#entry--154) [I've](/imbentori/#entry--292)
[written](/imbentori/#entry--378)
[about](/20) in the past. But there will come a time when I look at my to-do
list, and an item will stand out for no good reason other than
I just feel like doing it.

It wouldn't go well always, though. Failure isn't always conducive to a
learning experience, sometimes leaving the project worse off than when I
started. At this point, it would have to be shelved until further
notice.

## Recent Wedding

Recently, we were invited to our relative's wedding. Before that,
they have been living together for almost four decades,
their three children witnesses to their ups and downs.
The couple say they're still in love, which is always a
welcoming news in a world of full of hate.

My subconscious reacts to this by sending me a dream about ethical
non-monogamy.

## Quote of the day

> If there's nothing left to do, [destroy everything you identify with](https://realhumanbaby.tumblr.com/post/691974027004231680/what-should-i-do),
> then identify with something that you cannot destroy.

Today, then, I am the void with a definite body yet enduring the biggest awe that is Nothing.

## Music

For the month of Dec 2023, these are the albums I listened to.

| Album Name          | Artist             |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| Mirage              | Glass Beams        |
| Sundowning          | Sleep Token        |

Both bands have unusual aesthetics involving covering up the
face: Glass Beams, an instrumental funk group that sounds like Khruangbin, use
crystal beads; and Sleep Token, a metal rock band, use eerie masks and
anonymity. Their sounds could not be more different that one another,
both of which appeal to me.
