- Relaunching the [Araw Seekers](https://seekers.araw.xyz) blog with my
  partner, via Bear Blog. Work in progress.
- [Done reading](/books) *Global Battlefields* by Walden Bello

## Brief review of *Global Battlefields*

Walden Bello tells his life of activism for different peoples of the
world (including, of course, us here in the so-called Philippines), and
against different state agents and forces in the same global scope.

His being an educator shows in his writing, in that it is clear and
replete with realistic ideas and real-life examples. Unfortunately, he
talks about much on topics that I am not particularly interested in
(e.g., neoliberalism), but that's a me-thing, not a him-thing.

At one point during my reading this book, my partner asked me
(non-verbatim), "What happens when you lose a legal battle at Supreme
Court?"

As someone who is neither a lawyer nor has a keen interest around
obeying the faithfully, I said, "It's time to take it to the streets."

Not knowing that this would become relevant in the book, I got to the
point in which Bello talks about the functions of [World Social Forum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Social_Forum) (WSF). Bello
mentions Naomi Klein, author of *No Logo* and how shetold a Porto Alegre
audience in January 2002 "that the need of the moment was 'less civil
society and more civil disobedience.'"

Recently, [Walden Bello did an AMA](https://old.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/1jyuply/i_am_walden_bello_globallyrenowned_academic_and/) (Ask Me Anything) on Reddit.

## One hot day...

- Woke up to a blowfan- and likely dehydration-induced headache.
- Time chek: spelling + gramar hard now at heat o'clock
- In the evening, a bit of solace as temperature becomes tolerable
  somewhat for the skin.
