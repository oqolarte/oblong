[Ernesto Oroza](https://www.ernestooroza.com/) coined the term
*technological disobedience*. He explains:

> As the crisis became more severe,
> people's creativity grew more powerful,
> and everywhere you looked,
> you saw solutions to the needs that people faced all the time,
> in every aspect of life.
> Transportation, children's toys, food, clothing…
> everything was replaced with substitutes produced by the people.

We could be entering a new era of censorship,
not by direct deletion of old or controversial content,
but by obscurity and omission of argument tactics.
It is not a random change.

It is hard to keep up with the technological and cultural progress at
the rate it is going. And with this, our minimum standard of living
constantly increases. If, say, we do not resist/refuse a harmful
technological solution (e.g., [road widening](https://old.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/165gq3b/empirical_evidencestudies_showing_road_widening/jye23fm/)
and/or
[adding more roads](https://politics.stackexchange.com/questions/15907/do-more-roads-lead-to-fewer-traffic-jams)),
we will be forced to buy
more harmful solutions to address the novel problems
that the previous one has created (e.g., acquiring more cars).
