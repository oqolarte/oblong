A simple life, to me, means:

- Not falling trap to the [hedonic treadmill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill),
which means chasing happiness but remaining in the same state.
- Being content with an imperfect life.
- [Being more than my work](/anti-work).
- Spending quality time with friends, family, and [significant other/s](/non-monogamy).
- [Having a small house](/dream-house)
(max of 70 square meters of floor area)
that one, max of two, people can maintain easily.

## Some short- to mid-term strategies to use

- Keep a journal using pen and paper to document life. [Bullet journal](/bujo) has worked well for me.
- When using the internet, consider using RSS feed instead of getting
  info from social media and other distracting sites, but --
- Read the news only at most once a week. If it's relevant enough, it
  will find it's way to you through the people around you.
- Gaming, especially video gaming, should be contained in its own
  [technology](/technology)/machine. I used to have a gaming-only PC.
- Put yourself in airplane mode and disconnect from the internet for a
  few hours each day.
- Try using [computer](/computer) the Unix way. Consider using TUI
  (terminal- or text-based user interface) for programs that are text
  heavy, e.g., text editors, email clients, RSS feed readers, etc. A
  great resource is [Terminal Trove](https://terminaltrove.com/)
- Ditch TV. Related to this, ava, in "[death to screens!](https://blog.avas.space/death-to-screens/)" post, talks
  about how they arrive to reducing the screens they use to one.
  Consider if that would also work for you.[^self]
- Detach from roles. You are more than your job, your achievements, or
  your schedule.

[^self]: Yes, that's *you*, Future Self.
