It doesn't really matter whether you vote or not.

The state will still do everything to remain in power. Capitalists will
do everything to fund the state to do it's thing.

So *vote*, if it's important to you. Some people argue that it can be a
form of harm reduction, that is, we can vote people that are more
aligned with our values and beliefs.

Or don't vote, if you believe we have more important things to do than
filling out a ballot.

What matters more are the things that we do in our daily lives that can
directly impact those around us.
