[Transformative justice](https://transformharm.org/tj_resource/transformative-justice-a-brief-description/)
(TJ) is a political framework and approach
for responding to violence, harm, and abuse
that's very different from the current carceral systems in place.
TJ aims to not reproduce the [violence](/violence).

## Apologies, Reparations

When you make an apology,
it doesn't belong to you anymore.
It's up to the party you've wronged whether to forgive you,
and you have to be prepared for whatever response.

Don't apologize to get forgiveness.
That's not an apology but a transaction.
Recognize the mistake you made and the damage you did,
try to lessen the damage,
and make sure you don't make that mistake again.
Expect nothing in return for this work you must do.
