## On vanguard shit

The most (in)famous variant of communism in the Philippine Archipelago,
Marxist-Leninist-Maoist (MLM) puts power in the hands of a small
'vanguard' to lead the revolution. Idealistically, this could be a great
thing: a diverse group of people with diverse ideas and approaches to
lead a diverse population to a communist state. However, realistically,
working-class women, disabled people, precarious workers, etc., do not
have the luxury of 'organizing' full-time. So, by design, the vanguard
becomes a sub-class of educated, often male theorists. You can't build a
people's revolution if only the people with free time and money get to
lead it.

Revolution built on theory, not care and community, misses the point.
Joy, [culture](/culture), and [human connection](/friendship) are what
draw people to a movement, not books and endless readings. Theory
excludes; communal action includes.

## Nothing is permanent

Feudalism didn't transform into capitalism one day.
We're not waiting for someone to start a revolution, but
the transformation out of [capitalism](/capitalism) is already underway.

There are people still living today
who were born before the rise of [nationalism](/nationalism)
and the creation of immigration controls.

From an anthropological perspective,
we're living in a historically rare period
where people are convinced that government exists for the good of people,
when in fact humans have always found [joy](/joyful-militancy)
in overthrowing authorities,
like what they did to Marcos on [EDSA revolution](/edsa-revolution)
or run away from states at every opportunity.

## Attack against impermanence

Alternative ways of living and relating to one another have been crushed
violently by agents of empire, or imperialist-wannabes. It does not mean
they failed.

We can rediscover these roads-not-taken because they remain
possibilities to better lives that do not have to be full of suffering
unless you're part of the oligarchy.

## Imagining the possibilities

We can rethink success to be something much smaller in scale.
It's extremely local, sometimes on a personal level.
It's being able to grow my own food
or spend more time around the people that I love.
It's those moments where you do feel free and autonomous,
even if they're fleeting.
Take a good long look at what an actual success
that can happen in your life is and go out and try for it.
And try to remember that in between all the moments
of righteous struggle and class war you do have to live at one point.

Do what you can now:
[plant trees](/social-ecology);
[eat less meat](/veganism);
go out and spend time with loved ones;
take walks and observe.
[Nature has not stopped](/solarpunk),
and it won't for a very, very long time.

[Start also with the self](/health).
What a person thinks and how they treat themselves
follows the same template as their relationships
with family and friends,
rippling out to immediate communities and the larger society.

The goal is to [abolish](/abolition) all kinds of oppression.
Anyone who wants to
become the oppressor does not want a lasting liberation for all.
It is difficult, knowing we will be fighting it on two fronts:
neoliberalism and [fascism](/fascism).

As for me, I feel the need to stick these ideals, because learning more
about them helps me undo what needs to be undone, and unlearn what needs
to be unlearned, both in service to make space for something I have
failed to imagine.
