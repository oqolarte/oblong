In [a Rappler event we attended last year](/228), one of the breakoout
rooms tackled about how we could imagine what climate-resilient
community would look like. It was around this time that I had just
finished rereading for the second time Nassim Taleb's [*Antifragile*](/antifragile).
In my mind, I had asked:

- **How would a climate-*antifragile* community look like?**
- What would the circumstances be that a natural regularly-occuring
  calamity (like typhoon) is actually beneficial?
- Is such a scenario even possible?

From time to time, it is important to ask ideal, even naive, questions,
because these dare us to imagine new ways of interacting with the world
around us. And imagination is becoming more and more important if we are
to reach escape speed from the status quo.

Because Typhoons (Crising + Dante + Emong) + Habagat = ðŸŒŠ

Are we going to survive this annual assault to our communities?

It does not look promising when (among other important things):
- receiving help from local government units is gamified through a
  raffle ([Calumpit mayor faces backlash for 'E-Ayuda' raffle requiring selfies from flooded residents](https://philstarlife.com/news-and-views/510159-calumpit-mayor-faces-backlash-e-ayuda-selfies-flooded-residents));
- animals are left behind to perish ([Several animals in pet shops in flooded Arranque Market drowned](https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/topstories/metro/953597/several-animals-in-pet-shops-in-flooded-arranque-market-drowned/story/));
- agriculture industries experience extensive damage ([Agri damage due to typhoons at P1.12B](https://tribune.net.ph/2025/07/25/agri-damage-due-to-typhoons-at-p112b));

With the severe damage that extreme weather changes bring---ranging from
personal to social to environmental---I think
it is impossible to be antifragile against the
powerful forces of Nature. To even think about is arrogant, perhaps the
same arrogance that put us at this place. And so, at
this point, resilient strategies are our best bet:
[communal and systemic solutions](/drrm)
that allow our communities to withstand and
bounce back from natural calamities.

As long as we are bombarded with messages that we need to consume more,
more, more; as long as the dominant system force us to seek comfort and
growth at the cost of [destruction](/destruction) of natural habitats;
as long as we celebrate authority because most of the good things in
life they have have hoarded and kept beyond our reach, only to be sold
back to us; an egalitarian society remains at the horizon,
taking a step further as we step forward to reach it.

If we were to approach antifragililty in this context, then we would need
[to change everything](https://cwc.im/tce).
