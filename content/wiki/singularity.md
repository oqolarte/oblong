Ray Kurweil popularized 'singularity',
a point in time when [artificial intelligence](/ai) surpasses human thinking.

John von Neumann was quoted as saying that
"the ever accelerating progress of technology...
gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity
in the history of the race beyond which human affairs,
as we know them, could continue."

I.J. Good believed that there will be an 'intelligence explosion',
a positive feedback loop within which minds will make technology
to improve on minds which, once started, will exponentially grow.

But if/when do we get there, no one is sure yet. Our current [technology](/technology)
Drew DeVault hypothesizes that "singularity is not coming" because of
"[AI crap](https://drewdevault.com/2023/08/29/2023-08-29-AI-crap.html)"
that we're all currently experiencing.
