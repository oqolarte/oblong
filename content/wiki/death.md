TRIGGER WARNING: Obviously, this page talks casually about death and
dying. Consider visiting other pages---or clicking away from this site
entirely---if this bothers you.

It is the end state of all living things. The dying part is where it
varies.

## Suicide

Does someone *commit* or *complete* suicide?

Commtting implies a decision has finally been made and enacted.
Completing implies that the process had started some time ago and has
now reached its intended goal.

Completing also appears less defeatist, as if the Void empowers its doer
to reach their "final, fullest form."

I don't mean to glorify it, though. Witnessing it is highly disturbing,
and this is only made possible by technologies that enable
livestreaming. Seeing death this intense will repeatedly prick the body
thousands, millions of times unless it becomes apparent that inaction
only induces pain.

[The act of committing] suicide is a hard choice to make, I would
imagine, but it grants one final moment of agency.
And [that is all that matters when things get super gnarly](/nihilism)
and the oppressors would not
stop until they have picked the bones clean.

### Choosing Life

As I both continue and struggle to choose life, despite emotional and
mental difficulties caused by Empire, I hurry not to the Void, however
tempting its come-hither blackness. My
[friends](/friendship) and I will be in the future together,
[joy-armed to the teeth](/revolution).

## Celebrity deaths

A list of celebrities whose deaths have made me genuinely sad. No one asked
for this but here goes:

- Amy Winehouse
- Chester Bennington
    - Not only was it sad to know that he succumbed to the dark, but as
      Antonio Melonio put it in his essay "[Emptiness Machine](https://beneaththepavement.substack.com/p/emptiness-machine)",
      many years later "the dark was *repurposed*---packaged---and sold
      to millions of millenial teenagers as catharsis on demand... He
      was replaced, and the show goes on." This is quite different from
      when Led Zeppelin's drummer [John Bonham died in 1980](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bonham#Death). Instead of
      replacing their him, the rock group disbanded, likely because of
      the "deep respect [they] have for [Bonham's] family, together with
      the sense of undivided harmony felt by ourselves and our
      manager[.]"
- Anthony Bourdain
- Grant Imahara
