## New Work

I recently started on my new job.
As with most jobs, the first week doesn't have much busyness to it.
I suspect that that would change rapidly in the coming weeks.

Bike rides to and from work, on the other hand,
are more exhausting than before.
Longer exposure to Manila traffic means greater risk of injury
because of, quite possibly, road rage from motorists.
That, combined with the constant rain and floods,
and an average cycling commuter like me might rethink
the benefits of having a bike in rage-filled urban city centers.
