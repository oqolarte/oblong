**me**, [*a byproduct of Tumblr nightposts & neodadaism*](/imbentori): What
are words if not for making out with the minds of future generations who
have yet to spring from the nurturing Void?

## Recently, on graduation

Recently, I had the chance to attend a graduation ceremony of a loved
one. Per tradition, organizers invited alumni speakers
with PhDs supposedly to deliver inspirational messages to the
graduates. Who were they kidding, though? These speakers could rarely
give engaging speeches, especially when all they have in their notes are
lists of their achievements that, frankly, only few of the audience
cares about, if any at all. One of the speakers even had to admit---on stage,
addressing the bored people in front of him, as if finally snapping out
of his trance of pompousness---that (non-verbatim) "[s]ince many of you are
starting to fall asleep, I'll cut to my message." *Wow*.

If your words cannot make out with the minds of future generations,
don't even bother stepping on the stage. Go publish a paper, instead.

In a hypothetical scenario in which I'm also a guest speaker right after
the PhD guy, my impromptu ice-breaker would be: "[*yawns into the mic*]
Thanks for that boring speech, Dr. _____. Time to wake up, graduates!"
And then proceed to also flop on my speech! Haha!

### Lightning rally

Leftist activists from that university, as usual, had a lightning rally
at the end, which in my opinion, was just bad performance for many reasons:

- It wasn't disruptive like how demonstrations should be, because it's
  expected that these leftists will do this;
- The big-name people including the university chancellor for whom many
  of their talking points are had already left at this point;
- It's not like people were asking to be disrupted by these activists'
  shrilling into the microphone and megaphones. Almost five hours in,
  people were already tired and hungry, and the last thing they wanted
  to hear were social injustices.

It could have been worth remembering if they talked, NOT yelled,
*briefly* about how creating spaces where [friendship](/friendship) and
[community](/community) would thrive is just as important as
[self-care](/health/#self-care), that rest is resistance; and that all of these can and will
contribute to the small-r [revolution](/revolution).
