## Product Manager, the person

1. What is and isn't a PRODUCT MANAGER?
    - is not a manager of people
    - manages a product, service
    - responsibilities include:
        - User research
        - road mapping
        - data analysis
        - [project management](/projm)
        - strategy
    - responsible for what the product is and why it should exist;
      when it goes live is something that's decided with the team.
      How it's assembled is out of scope and is fully up to the experts in the team.
2. 4 common types of Product Managers
    - Consumer - builds products for general consumer (e.g.: IG)
        - responsibilities include ideation, testing, data analysis, user
          research
    - Internal - builds products for the internal company
        - usually focuses on the project management
    - Business to Business (b2b) - builds product for another company
        - execution focused
    - Technical - heavily focused on the technical aspects of the company
        - solves complex technological problems
    - Note: Although having a sales team as a stakeholder is most likely
    to be a situation the Business to Business PM will be in,
    it is possible that people from a sales team could be a stakeholder for
    any PM type - it all depends on the company and product.
3. Qualities of Great Product Managers
    - [Great communication skills](/communication)
    - Technical Knowledge know-how - knows how to talk about the underlying
      tech because they understand it enough to communicate it to other teams.
    - Problem-oriented: focuses on the user problem, not on the solution one
      assumes to work.
    - Leadership skills:
        - listening
        - addressing concerns
        - being open to criticism
        - practicing transparency
        - being accountable
        - giving credit to others
4. Transition internally or externally
    - Internally: Easier to move within the company
      (assuming you're employed in one)
    - Externally: Harder to transition to, since you'll have to convince the
      next company that you have the prod manager skills that they
      need.
        - Possible if you display any side projects and show your work online
        - In your current company, take on projects that match a prod
          manager's responsibilities
            - Remember: Leading cross-team projects, talking to users, data
              analysis, make strategic recommendations to leadership
            - Document these!
    - NOTE: Although it's not always logistically possible,
    having the title of product manager at your current job
    will increase your chances of getting the job somewhere else,
    even if you only had the title for a short time.
5. Have an online brand
    - Have a personal website (done!)
    - Have a public-facing social media presence (*ugh*). Twitter might work,
      but better Mastodon. Stay away from polarizing topics?
    - Have a blog (done!) related to prod management (not done!)
    - NOTE: Not only does having your own online space show that you're with the times,
    but you can express yourself there and put a more human touch behind a boring resume.
6. Show off a portfolio or side project
    - Talk about a past project and slant it towards to prod management. E.g.:
        - problem
        - possible solutions
        - metrics
        - results
        - outcomes
        - Knowledge gained
    - Side project (from anything in your life) (applicable if you don't have
      any work/professional experience yet)
        - problem
        - solution
        - outcomes
    - "The more product-minded you appear to be, using those product
      management terms, the better off you are."
7. Creating the Product Manager resume
    - Topics to include:
        - Projects you've led, especially those with lots of cross-department
          comms
        - User research
        - Project Manager
        - Data analysis
    - Quantify everything

## Vibe Driven Development

[Robin Rendle explores this kind of development](https://www.robinrendle.com/notes/vibe-driven-development/).
He argues that when we see people as just a data,
the potential to gain better insight diminishes.

Sure enough, we over-rely on the importance of quantitative data.
But humans are social creatures with emotions.
Shouldn't we at least factor in the feelings of a user
when using/consuming a product?

## Product Decline

If a product tries to do too much
by attempting to reach many verticals---which
is a fancy term for business niches---it
won't accomplish too many.
It being feature-rich means
it also has many points of failure.
