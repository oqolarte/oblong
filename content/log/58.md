Late this afternoon, I just received the aforementioned adapter
that I ordered from Shopee.
I've been using mSATA SSD when Ador (a thinkpad X220) was still active.
To access my current OS and files there, said adapter is needed.

This post is proof that my mSATA SSD and the adapter I bought
works together.
I booted into the OS installed in it via Isya's Thinkpad T440, codename: Trader.

I'll see you in a bit.
