Is there an absolute objective reality when all observations depend on
the observer measuring the [behavior of the] object? I know for a fact
that no human observer can be fully objective; we will always carry our
own biases and lived experiences in the work we do.

## Music

For the month of Apr 2024, these are the albums I listened to.

| Album Name            | Artist                |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Pieces of a Man       | Gil Scott-Heron       |
| Three Sacred Souls    | Three Sacred Souls    |
| Prelude to Ecstasy    | The Last Dinner Party |
| Only God Was Above Us | Vampire Weekend       |
| internet dump         | cosmic collective     |

As a Vampire fan since their first album, their latest *Only God Was
Above Us* felt new yet familiar, with Ezra Koenig still as the main
vocals. Myopic me did not have the foresight that an album was coming
when [they dropped two songs last Feb 2024](/169/#music), which in
itself is a blessing.
