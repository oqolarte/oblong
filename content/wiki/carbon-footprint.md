Don't get obsessed with keeping your carbon footprint as low as possible
as doing so won't be good for your mental and physical health. Companies
invented the personal carbon footprint as a propaganda tool.

['Carbon Footprint was coined by Big Oil to blame you for climate change,](https://interestingengineering.com/culture/carbon-footprint-coined-by-big-oil-to-blame-you-for-climate-change),
putting the onus on you as an individual to change, instead of them.

"[Voting](/voting) with your wallet" won't save the planet, but more
importantly: You are not a sin. Your basic needs deserve to be met. You
deserve to be warm and filled with food that satisfies you. You deserve
to see your [friends](/friendship) and family and [spend time with them](/community).

The planet, a big chunk of rock hurtling in space, doesn't need to be
saved. We want to save ecosystems, plants, and animals, including
people. You are part of the Life that deserves to thrive.

BUT, this is not to encourage you to overshoot into the opposite
direction that you start thinking that we can save ecosystems by
guillotining a few oil executives and other rich people while 1.475
billion cars keep driving and 35 million flights per year keep flying
and 92 billion animals get slaughtered annually.

Because individual consumer choices will not save us,
a lot of [the changes we need are systemic](/revolution).
This includes, but certainly is not limited to:

- We need a strong railway transit system so people don't need flights;
- We need access to affordable healthy foods so [reducing the consumption of animal products](/veganism) is easier
to maintain;
- We need to restructure our economy to prioritize what will
stop global warming while increasing human well-being, [not profits](/capitalism).

All of that will change our day to day lives in almost every
possible way. That is very much a part of not burning up the planet.

And while personal choices won't bring the systematic change that we
need, if you can do so without sacrificing an unreasonable amount of
quality of life, reducing the biggest CO2 output factors in your own
life is a good idea.
