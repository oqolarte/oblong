Where am I when it matters? In my head, projecting outward, wiring and
rewiring, writing and rewrit(h)ing my life in and out of the void? In
reality, I cannot be everywhere and be everyone. And so choosing which
battles to face has been a lifelong journey, not only for me I'm sure,
but for everyone that matters to me.

I have been reading *Purity* by Jonathan Franzen for many months now.
Even for a slow reader like me, that's a snail pace. The book, for me,
wanders too much, to say the least, but in the meandering forest of
prose---the only forest safe enough to find sleep---I found this gem,
which I am paraphrasing:

> At the core of shyness could be a superiority (thus, inferiority)
> complex that hinders the person from having a healthy social life.

At times when I veer from social interactions, I need to be honest with
myself on the intention behind this choice. Otherwise, it will be a lonely
life ahead of me. For example, when I bought a second-hand Samsung S10e
at [smartphone area in Greenhills VMall](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=greenhills+vmall+smartphone) (YouTube),
I was sure that the density of salespeople there
vying for my attention would quickly drain my social battery. It is
intense over there! Even the most extroverted people should be wary.
In bazaars like this, it's only practical to know exactly what you want
and make it a point to get it as soon as possible, then exit.

A few days after that, we attended a zine making workshop that tackles
[animal liberation](/animal-liberation). I chose to fully participate
here, as I thought events like this are great avenues to promote
relevant radical
ideas people might be interested about. After creating our zines,
which was fun in itself, we got to present them to the other
participants. When it was my time to show my work, I managed to
transform to my more outgoing self. I would say that my presentation was
well received. I might write about the contents of the zine I make soon.
