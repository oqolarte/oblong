Our security is only as good as the humans that "maintain" it.
Whether we like it or not, it becomes increasingly complex.
Adding a functionality---be it to software or hardware---can introduce
unexpected vulnerabilties.

Security Mindset encourages a different way of looking at the world
around us: to get into the thinking of a would-be bad actor and how can
the current systems, [including digital systems](/cybersecurity), in
place be exploited; to question the norms and assumptions. For example,
how can we [better talk to each other in private](/cryptography)?

Not that we plan on doing something bad, but rather the opposite. By
trying to identify a system's weaknesses, we get closer at making it
more secure. Teaching designers how a system might fail is just as
important as thinking about how they will work.

Security, in any context, is not something one adds on ad hoc.
It has to be included in all stages of development and implementation.

[Technologies](/technology) change rapidly.
And yet, some hackers don't even have to be that tech-savvy to infiltrate a
system. If they could get in by playing on one's good nature,
it's [social engineering](/social-engineering).

If more people had a security mindset,
the world as we know it now would be safer and more secure,
even as technologies evolve in ways we haven't begun to imagine yet.

## Security Frameworks and Controls

Security frameworks are guidelines used for building plans to help
mitigate risks and threats to data and [privacy](/privacy). They have
four core components:

1. Identifying and Documenting security goals
2. Setting guidelines to achieve security goals
3. Implementing security processes
4. Monitoring and communicating results

Security controls are safeguards
designed to reduce specific security risks.

### CIA Triad

The CIA (confidentiality, integrity, availability) triad is a
foundational [cybersecurity](/cybersecurity) model that helps inform how organizations consider risk
when setting up systems and security policies.

## Ethics

For every new security incident or risk, the right or
wrong decision isn't always clear.

Security ethics are guidelines for making appropriate decisions as a
security professional. Being ethical requires that security
professionals remain unbiased and maintain the security and
confidentiality of private data.

Some ethical principles:

- Confidentiality: there needs to be a high level of respect for privacy
  to safeguard private assets and data
- [Privacy](/privacy) protections: To effectively safeguard PII
  (personally identifiable information) and SPII (sensitive PII)
  data, security professionals hold an ethical obligation to secure
  private information, identify security vulnerabilities, manage
  organizational risks
- Laws

### International standpoint on counterattacks

The International Court of Justice (ICJ), which updates its guidance regularly, states that a person or group can counterattack if: 

- The counterattack will only affect the party that attacked first.
- The counterattack is a direct communication asking the initial
  attacker to stop.
- The counterattack does not escalate the situation.
- The counterattack effects can be reversed.

Organizations typically do not counterattack because the above scenarios
and parameters are hard to measure. There is a lot of uncertainty
dictating what is and is not lawful, and at times negative outcomes are
very difficult to control. Counterattack actions generally lead to a
worse outcome, especially when you are not an experienced professional
in the field.
