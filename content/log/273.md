- Added new project: [Recipe for Kamias Jam](/kamias-jam)

My lethargy seems perpetual, but there are, fortunately, spikes of
productivity that I am able to sustain for some period. Perhaps, if
there is another life past this one, I would be a
[plant](/plants), contributing in my own little way in my own little
space simply by *being*. Maybe as a [duhat tree, which incidentally, is now blooming](/93) as of writing this.
