- Added some sections in the [Old Computer Challenge](/old-computer).
Will still be polishing it in the coming days.

## Got new-old bike from a Japan surplus[^surplus]!

It's [FOLK by Aresbikes](https://folkbyaresbikes.tumblr.com/).

{{< figure src="/image/folk.jpg" alt="black bike facing the drivetrain side" caption="Photo from the online shop; pedals *are* installed when I got it" >}}

[^surplus]: Many things, bikes included,
that the Japanese people don't want anymore,
some Filipino merchants buy in bulk and resell here.
In theory, one gets a good product---because
it's "Made in Japan"---for
a reasonably affordable price.

For posterity, here are the specs:
- Size 51 cm seat tube, center to top
- 52 cm top tube, center to center
- Chromoly[^crmo] steel frame and fork
- 90 mm oversized stem aluminum
- 54 cm gentlemanâ€™s bar aluminum
- Tektro mini brakes
- Dual pivot brake caliper
- High flange hubs aluminum
- Flip-flop rear hubs single speed/fixed
- Prowheel chariot single crankset 170 arm
- 30 mm aero rims 700c with brakeline
- 27.2 mm seatpost
- 700x28c tires

It's rusty on some joints, and it may need some minor adjustments,
but I like it!
As long as it can transport me between two or more multiple points,
I'm good.

[^crmo]: Chromoly steel is a type of low alloy steel
(chromium + molybdenum)
that's used when strength is required.
Also used in high pressure and temperature,
commonly found in oil & gas, energy, construction, and automotive industries.

## Some weeknotes

Why not share some of the thoughts I've had during the Old Computer Challenge?

- I found no lame excuse to look in the mirror and admire from time to time the way Isya cut my hair. *Galing eh!*
- Walking the dog daily must be a thing,
but we only have limited willpower.
- Finally got around to finishing the graphic novel *V for Vendetta*.
I've been putting that off for weeks now.
Personally, I like David Lloyd's artwork.
It's written without sound effects, which creates a disorienting experience.
- According to a meme, there's a new talk show:
"Looking at the symptoms of Capitalism weekly while avoiding the underlying problem, with John Oliver"
- People who speak loudly, almost shouting, why?
- Do I even need a proper camera when, to me, photographs act only as visual anchors?
- I can create even with a simple aesthetic.
In fact, simplicity is a template that has guided my expression recently.

*This is Day 8, last day of the [Old Computer Challenge](/old-computer)*.
