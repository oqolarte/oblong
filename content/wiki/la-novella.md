## Dedication (?)

ACROSS ALL TIMES AND ALL WORLDS:
To past me who wouldn't believe it;
to Isya here and now;
and to the blooming flora and fauna that *will* rise from the ruins of
Empire in the distant future

## One-sentence pitch

A man with super-regeneration uses his own flesh as an ingredient in the dishes
he cooks, and he wants to end Hunger.

## One-paragraph pitch

A man who accidentally discovers his super-regeneration abilities when
he was young decides to open a diner in an effort to feed as many people
in his community at an affordable price. His mad idea is to offer
himself, literally, as an ingredient in the food, by cutting flesh
(since it will grow back anyway), [preserving it](/meat-preservation) in
a way, and then preparing meals. In succeeding operations, he discovers
it's harder to keep this unorthodox way a secret from his small crew. He
also notices that his regeneration rate is getting longer, until it
reaches a point that it's taking years for him to heal.

## Characters

- An eccentric group of three people called Sunshine:
        - glam model, photog, make-up artist
        - Glam model is a conventionally attractive woman in her early 20s
        - Photographer is mid-30s, a bi-femme that leans towards butch side
        - Make-up artist is a queer guy, who's roughly the same age as the
          model; they're former classmates in a well known art school in Manila.
- 4 main conflicting characters, also with superhuman abilities:
        - Amorsolo (like the famous painter), a self-taught chef with incredible self-regeneration (anarch)
        - Pete, charms their way out of problems, and way into solutions
          ([fasc](/fascism))
        - Krima, who has never received any kind of physical harm in
          their life. As soon as the harm-doer has decided to inflict
          harm on them, harm-doer inflicts it on themself at the very
          last moment. Krima will also learn to extend this ability to
          other people over short distances depending on their mastery.
        - Lovelyn, is just so damn lucky. But her luck is a function of
          her active participation in any given situation.
- A rich aswang (politico? businessman? both?) has domestics helpers who
  are overworked and underpaid. They plan to escape their master.

## Locations

- A small city/town has been turned into a commune, taking inspiration
  from Diliman Commune, but learning from its mistakes. All its entry
  and exit points have concrete bollards that only allow human-powered
  modes of transpo, like [bikes](/bike), push-carts, wheelchairs.

## Other Ideas

- Plot idea: One of the character's soliloquy:
        - "I feel like I'm in a chapter that's about to end.
        If you're responsible for this, please put down the book
- RESENTMENT FACILITY: A place where parties settle their differences,
  mediated by a trusted third-party facilitator from within the
  community.
