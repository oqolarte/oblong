It seems like a great idea.
Who doesn't want free money?

But UBI is a trap---it increases people's dependence on the state.
It preserves capitalism and work.
It's also likely that any amount of monthly UBI
the state would give would not be [enough to live comfortably on](/simple-living).
We might still have to work.

It would also be likely not be available to asylum seekers
and illegal immigrants,
which only widens the socioeconomic class divide.
