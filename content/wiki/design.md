A good design is a boring design.
It doesn't interfere,
but it works when and where you need it.

A good design is the result of patience.

## Characteristics of a good design

According to [Koray Er](https://korayer.de/posts/good-design.txt)
and
[Dieter Rams](https://www.vitsoe.com/us/about/good-design)

1. Accessible to as many people as possible
2. Innovative
3. Useful
4. Beautiful
5. Understandable, or better yet, self-explanatory
6. Does not interrupt
7. Honest
8. Long-lasting
9. Thorough down to the last detail
10. Environmentally-friendly
11. Simple and without the non-essentials

## Web Development

In which, I try to be as minimal and as brutalist with my design choices
whenever possible.
Because simple websites don't get in the way of delivering
information, knowledge, and/or wisdom to the visitors.

Websites shouldn't have [deceptive patterns](https://www.deceptive.design/).

## UI/UX

User Interface (UI) is how it looks
(visual, pertains to colors, typography, iconography, layout).
User Experience (UX) is how it feels
(pertains to navigation, story, how the product interacts with the
person).

Bad UX is bad [security](/security).

### Prototypes vs Wireframes

Wireframes is like the skeleton of the product (e.g., website),
while the prototype is the appearance.

Like most products,
the design must produce a structure of what the end result would be
(wireframes).
From that we can start adding the visual elements for the prototype.


## Visual

People, for better or worse, appreciate a visible effort.
