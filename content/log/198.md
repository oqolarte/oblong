- Edited [Site](/site) to replace one of my inspirations for building
  this digital garden.
- Updated [robots.txt](/robots.txt) which is more of a symbolic act at
  this point rather than something I expect to fend off corporations'
  web crawlers.

Recently watched *Godzilla Minus One*. While this isn't a review per se,
it made me reflect. Watching and then thinking about
war is somewhat downing. I'm grateful that no one around me glamorized
and glorified the last world war in telling their stories. Nobody wins
in wars except those who profit from it and those who gain power by
participating in it, which is just handful of people, really.

No one deserves to be caught in the middle of a war. No one deserves to
be displaced and uprooted, to be killed, to starve in it, especially the
marginalized and the disenfranchised. No one deserves to be forced to
give up their lives to fight someone else's battle and have no full
autonomy in it.
