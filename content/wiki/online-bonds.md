Like many things tangled in the digital space, the notes below are
scattered and would only gel around a central theme. Internet is a weird
thing, but it's this weirdness that allows strange yet modern
relationships to come into existence.

## Shocking, I know

It's amazing how many digital relationships rely on specific
fluctuations of electrons and photons over webs of cables and boards of
chips and panes of glass. Equally amazing is how, as humans, have
learned so much over the past decades that we can now make virtual
realities by manipulating these particles through essentially what is
just an elaborate implementation of boolean algebra, and jumpstarting a
futuristic dystopia in the process. Maybe.

When we chat someone on our favorite messaging app, or when we
video-call a loved one, I wonder how much energy it takes to complete
the loop, from hello to goodbye.

## Friends to keep?

The digital friends I met during my stay on Tumblr is now "harder to
reach" since my moving away from the platform. Assuming that we all have
access to internet, [social media platforms](/social-media) become barriers when they are
designed to be walled gardens, shunning non- and/or former users.

Without obvious way to sustain the bond, these digital relationships are
prone to wither faster than when it was formed in a decentralized space.
Perhaps, this is where the Fediverse excels: one can have their own
space, and still be able to connect to other servers.

Similar to Fediverse, [friendships](/friendship) are inherently
decentralized no matter the medium of [communications](/communication).
As I have said, though, barriers put up by main social media platforms
do pose a threat.

Nowadays, I'm back to blogging like it's 2005, only this time, the words
I write and the web pages on which I publish them are mine. However, I
need [my setup](/site) to be as simple as it needs to be; complexity
means more mental bandwidth. To be sustainable, it needs to have the
right balance between frictionless and not too boring. I can easily
migrate all this to different hosting service---or host my own!---, or change top-level
domain with relative ease. No one company can lock me down.

I'm also in the habit of reading [other people's blogs](/blogroll), and when their
post moves me in whatever way, I tend to write them a short email saying
so. This can be tricky, though---I don't want to come off as creepy by
knocking uninvited on someone's personal digital space (such as one's
email inbox), and yet how else can I try to make new connections outside
of [anti]social media? Sometimes, I'd imagine my online friends and I
coming up with epistolary works by compiling our email correspondence.

## Maintenance of online bonds

Even digital relationships are hard to maintain, perhaps as hard as
those in real life, especially when consent and context gets blurry
through the supposed urgency of wanting to make something happen.

Asynchronous component of such bonds may or may not contribute to its
wellness. Internet natives are most likely already aware of this and
potentially using it as a feature. It doesn't mean though that it should
be the default. It's not natural; humans have been talking to each other
in real time since the dawn of our existence.

Physical space could also be a contributing factor, that is, considering
to meet in person would allow online friends to gauge each other via
body language how they actually behave.

But I know from experience that
space can be limiting. Finding friends online helps expand our social
bubble without having to shell out resources for transportation. In the
absence of free and publicly accessible place where friends can just
hangout, *and* with the relatively affordability of internet, it makes
more sense for a lot of people to pursue digital relationships instead.
I wonder, though: at what cost?
