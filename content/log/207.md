Mornings are always a good time to ride a bike wherever or whenever the
destination is. As for the latter, I speak it un-mystically in that, my
days often pass without having observed them enough to remember the
details.

I don't suppose cycling would help, but perhaps it might in
small ways. Missing the details would mean gaps in memory. Now, what
liquid gold is there with which to fill these cracks? Is it in
fictionalizing what was forgotten? Artists call it creative journalism,
an excuse to express the void because reality---boredom---does not
always work. And I want to [write a book](/imbentori), but can we leave
out the part where I have to disclose how I tend to not remember
everything?

The urban smog might shroud our skies and honking of
cars might make everyone more annoyed than what is needed, but this
exercise is part of the experience: You, the rider, is a weaver of
invisible paths, lining the gaps of cars and pedestrians alike with your
dust *safely*, because you are in it not for the thrill but for the fun.

Life, I am realizing, is more interesting when it passes by while
"you're on a bike" as compared to being "in a car". Biking to and from
places is both tiring and reinvigorating. It's a laugh at angry drivers
stuck in gridlock.
