Opening up to friends is fine, encouraged even. Being vulnerable is what
makes the bonds stronger.

However, opening up to strangers online has always been weird for me. To
witness the unraveling of someone's intimate life, whether in text or
media files, is such an odd concept to accept. It is as if knowing these
details grants anyone access to their personal space (it does not).

Sometimes, I cannot help but spin up my own assessments based only on
what I see on their profile, especially when I see shit like how this
Consumeristic Vacation Abroad would "fix the flow of [their]
energy".[^energy]

"Sometimes," I say to myself, justifying how I judge people online, "it
is this New Age shit with late-stage [Capitalism](/capitalism) slant that, in my
opinion, deserves some flak."

Of course, I do not do that. There is already so much fire out there
that it is pointless to start another one.

[^energy]: Except instead of using "energy," use some equivalent term
from Asian cultures, like *chakra* or *qi*.
