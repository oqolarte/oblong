We have a climate crisis.
But people in power---[capitalists](/capitalism), states, [empires](/empire)---seemingly
have no interest in preserving a healthy environment for us all.

Either we're fast approaching collapse; or it has already begun and
we're in a slow but unending downward spiral.

## What is collapse?

Collapse, in this context,
refers to the significant loss of an established level
or complexity towards a much simpler state.
It can occur differently within many areas,
most likely [chaotically](/chaos),
and be willing or unwilling.
It does not necessarily mean extinction or a singular, global event.
In fact, many believe a more accurate depiction would be
"a slow and steady, yet endless, decline of society as we know it today."
[Whether we are prepared for this disaster](/drrm) is another thing to be
addressed.

## Are we close to a collapse of Capitalism?

Capitalists have proven themselves more resilient and adaptable
than "material conditions" would indicate.
Being resilient in this context pertains to their adaptability
to integrate themselves into state apparatuses
exactly so governments will intervene.
Moreover, crisis is an integral part of capitalism.
Recall how [Amazon's profits soared during COVID-19 pandemic](https://fortune.com/2021/10/18/amazon-massive-growth-covid-pandemic-8-charts/).
We won't see the end of capitalism without a [revolutionary intervention](/revolution).

## Live, even in the face of collapse

Nothing is set in stone. All advanced civilizations before ours have
collapsed, and it won't be different this time. With so many crises
happening, our collapse might have already started, about to happen
soon, or still ways off depending on numerous factors, like where you
are.

But, there's nothing wrong with living. Even extravagantly once in a
while as in, per Oscar Wilde, keeping
moderation itself in check.

And while partying can be fun for many, it's
[not the only way](/mutual-aid).
We can live in shared housing, growing food together,
and building community. It shouldn't take escapism to not feel awful.

If the walls are closing in, you have the choice to stand right in the
middle where they meet and party as if everything isn't collapsing. Or we
can push back against the walls, together, and be united in the greater
purpose of saying "if youre going to wipe me and my fellow humans out,
we're not going without a fight."
