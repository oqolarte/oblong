## Who am I (right now)

I am a researcher and maker with over ten years of experience helping
people and organizations understand there are better possibilities
outside prevailing systems.

My greatest strength (so far) is writing stories and documenting learnings with
the [purpose of sharing them with others](/wiki).

I am eager to improve the lives of people, myself included, in
communities I am in, because I value the strength and power we possess
as a collective in shaping the Here and Now that we want to live in.

I have always wanted to learn and make something. These
days, that *thing* skews abstract, but I hope to create more tangible
things using different tools ([hardware](/tools) and [software](/foss)
alike) that might be useful. For R&R, I like to read movies and watch
[books](/books) to switch things up.

Sometimes, people say [good things](/testi) about me.

## I'll read your blog

*At babasahin ko ang blog mo kahit Tagalog!*

Inspired by Manuel Moreale's call, "[I'll read it](https://manuelmoreale.com/i-ll-read-it)" and Matthew Cambion's long text about the same thing.

I will read your blog
within reason and some limits listed below. Email me your website's URL.
Let us expand the internet beyond the walled trash sites of big social
media platforms.

### Limitations

- I can't be bothered reading through paywalls, authwalls, and login
  walls.
- If your blog promotes authoritarianism, pro-police, pro-militarism,
  capitalism, sexism, racism, anti-queer or anti-trans sentiment,
  genocide, or any sort of supremacist ideology, Iâ€™ll only read it once.
- I am not interested in cryptocurrency, blockchain tech, Web3, or
  generative AI (gen AI), unless your blog is a fiery critique against
  any/all of those.
- If I sensed that you used gen AI on your website (whether as
  text or as a "hero" image) and you did not disclose it, I'm
  immediately not interested. Even if you disclosed it, I'd still be
  wary of what you have to say, unless it's a fiery critque against the
  use of gen AI.
- I can read blogs in English and Tagalog (or Taglish).

## Contact

Please, [just use email](https://justuseemail.com/). (Email ad on footer)

Some good icebreakers:
- A reply/comment to one of the posts I made here
- "What have you been reading?"
- "You talked about [Something]. How do you/I/we act on [Something
  (related)]? Or, what are your thoughts on [This Other Thing]?"
- "[An Interesting Event] will happen on [This Date] at [That Place].
  Have you heard about it? I think you'd be interested."
- "If you liked listening to [Artist], you might enjoy listening to
  [This Other Artist] and/or [This Genre].
