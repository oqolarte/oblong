## draft

Lately, the neighborhood I live in has been
accumulating filth, mostly in the form of flattened dried dog poop on
the streets.

I'm sure this is common occurence in many cities around the world. This
is just me trying to process why I must now make more effort in avoiding
squished shit than before.

When I can, I hangout with a group of mobility justice advocates. In one
of the care workshops aimed they organized last September 2025 at
helping advocates, one of the facilitators included animals as one of
the vulnerable road users, along with PWDs, senior citizens,
pedestrians, and cyclists. Although they mentioned it in only passing as
a precursor to something else, this particular piece of information was
novel to me at the time, and it made a lasting impact.

Poor animals of the concrete jungles are indeed vulnerable to daily
violence of [Empire](/empire): from getting hit by cars, having no safe
and reliable shelter, to eating from the pile of discarded human food.

Street animals shitting on streets should be the last thing I, or anyone
claiming as progressive with their politics, should worry about.

Or, looking at it another way: if I want the street animals to stop
pooping on pavement in our neighborhood, we---yes, because this is a
collective effort and I am involving you in this right now, dear
reader---should work towards total [animal liberation](/animal-liberation).

Think about it: how we interact with animals (and nature in general)
reflects how we interact with ourselves and each other as humans.
Treating any nonhuman life form as "less than" is [to be open] to
subject them to human-made violence, knowingly or otherwise.

For example, many of us treat their pet dogs as properties,
some*thing* to be shaped or bent to will: putting them in cute shoes
and dresses, tweaking features through extensive breeding programs, etc.
Many believe that dogs existed because our ancestors domesticated them
from wild wolves. And while that is true, it is only half of the story.
Evolution of dogs has also affected the evolution of modern humans.

Treating animals as equals is a radical act---of love, dare I say---and
it requires overhauling of everything we know about ourselves as humans
and the world we cohabit with other nonhumans, street dogs included!

Imagine organizing---for the more progressives in the crowd, buckle up,
because I will be stretching the definition of organizing--- *with*
animals to arrive at a more just and inclusive future. I do not
know how that would like, but we could start treating them with
dignity and respect all life forms deserve, and not, you know,
putting them in cold metal cages to suffer for the remainder of their
existence. Or maybe it could simply having healthy friendships with them
if/when human ones become harder to navigate for whatever reason.
