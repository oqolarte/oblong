## Intro

There's so much heated debate between vegans and omnivores online and
elsewhere.

We have reached a point where some societies can already go full vegan,
while others simply can't, whether it's because of their environment or
something else.

Over time, I hope for this page to evolve to include ideas on this topic
for me (and reader/s?) as a non-vegan to think about.

## For the non-vegans

Just don't farm animals in boxes for the entirety or most of their
lives. We should still be free to eat what we can, as long as you don't
add more suffering to this plane of existence.

Eating a corpse does nothing to the animal after it's dead, and if
everything is going to die eventually, farming animals for meat is in of
itself alright. But if that farming involves the unspeakable torture,
it's unjustifiable and loathesome.

Ideally, we should all be concerned with animal rights and reducing the
harm of factory farming, animal testing, and other things that
contribute to animal cruelty.

## Is it the answer?

To what, exactly, I am not sure.

It could be that veganism is the answer to *many* different problems,
like climate crisis and animal cruelty.

As we transition from the current [empires](/empire) of oppression into
a [solarpunk](/solarpunk) future, I imagine it will be more like just
slightly more technically advanced version of Indigenous Peoples' way of
living. And as we know, IP still "consume" animal products, but on much
smaller scale, implementing more mindful ways that in so doing does not
rob the land of Life, very much unlike industrialized animal husbandry
that we know today.

Until we get there, vegans are probably on the right path, but theirs is
only one of the many right paths.
