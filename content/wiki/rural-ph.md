Here are my notes and reflections on reading Juan M. Flavier's books
[*My Friends in the Barrios*](/260/#brief-review-of-my-friends-in-the-barrios) and *Doctor to the Barrios*.

## Intro

The simpler philosophy in rural life does not mean it is any less deep.
When juxtaposed with urban "complexity" and modernity, the contrast
reveals wisdom we might have been taking for granted.

## Basic project requirements

[Before introducing changes](/second-order-thinking) and possibly fail miserably,
four basic requirements must be met [for a project to be successful](/projm)
in a barrio

1. It must be simple.
2. It must be affordable.
3. It must be relevant and has practical uses.
4. It must be duplicable.

## On farming as business/endeavor

The real risk of farming and agriculture in general, unfortunately, is
carried by the farmers. Middlemen have always skirted these risks by
not doing the actual labor, first and foremost. Middlemen of agriculture
keeps all the gains (while avoiding the risks), skewing the flow of
profit. They must be [the fragile component](/antifragile) of farm-to-market food supply
chain, and I for one will certainly not be sad when they go out of
business.

Even in barrios, lending as a business is lucrative. Usury is practiced
by those with [capital](/capitalism), implementing the infamous "5-6" (said as
"five-six"). This is shorthand for loaning 5 pesos and is payable at 6
pesos within an agreed timeline, usually a day. That's 20% interest
rate!

To some small agribusiness owners, though,
[peace of mind](/simple-living) is better than
[the unforessen effects](/second-order-thinking) of profit.

From what I heard from relatives who work with farmers, they might
believe in the science of a better agriculutral method, but they won't
necessarily adopt or switch to it for lack of capital. Aside from that,
[skin in the game](/skin-in-the-game) is also important for them: If you
want to convince them, show don't tell. Rake in the profits in the next
harvest season.

Of course, farmers have some practical knowledge and know-how when it
comes to agriculture; many of them can be open-minded and explores
beyond monocropping. For example, in a field of pineapple, some farmers
plant cash crops like *siling pukinggan*, eggplant, gabi, *kalabasa*,
even dwarf papaya, in between rows of pineapple. The profit from these
crops, having a lifecycle of only a few months, will be used as
fertilizer for the principle crop (in this example, the pineapple).

## Socializing

In barrios, close-knit [communities](/community) demand that the husband
in a newly-wed couple be able to prove his masculinity by
getting his wife pregnant as soon as they are married. This tradition
perpetuates the vitriol of [patriarchy](/patriarchy), which also
enforces certain stereotypes that men must adhere to. Otherwise, the
husband is deemed weak or impotent.

Perpetuating gender roles seems to be the norm in many rural areas. Some
parents wish to have daughters because "they can help in household
chores," or if they are conventionally attractive, they can be gateways
to a wealthy life when they are married off to a son of *haciendero*.

A strategy for family planning could be to normalize gestures of
affection like kissing. If being affectionate is being lascivious in a
conservative environment, and that acts of so-called lasciviousness is
sought in secret, then making it a common thing would dispel any
negatively sexual charges to such act, provided that it is indeed
harmless. Kissing between husband and wife is indeed harmless, and can
even boost morale for both individuals in a non-sexual manner.

[DDT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDT) is an insecticide in powder
form, which was used to comabt lice. When dissolved in oil, though, it
becomes highly toxic. In one of his interactions with barrio women who
were picking lice from off of each others' heads, Dr. Flavier suggested
to use DDT to eliminate the parasite. The women said they would rather
not if it meant losing this social activity as their pasttime. In this
anecdote, we can observe that modern people are quick to judge the
perceive primitivity of rural people without first having a deep
understanding on why they do what they do. Solutions like what Flavier
suggested could have likely caused harm.

In the barrio and beyond, we want a combination of change and status
quo. More accurately, we should keep all the good things in our culture
and replace all the bad. But how do collectively agree which is which?

## Alternative healing

The healing process conducted by an *albularyo* (herb doctor) involves
community work. Albularyo, when summoned, goes to a patient in barrio
bringing nothing but clothes on his person. He---most, if not all,
albularyos are men---expects that the family of the patient has already
prepared everything that he needs to conduct his rituals. Apart from the
sick, albularyos find it important to also heal the family and
relatives, or at least include them in the healing ritual. Family and
relatives are also on standby in case he might need something fetched
during his prayers. Tradition dictates that he only accepts gifts as
payments in kind, usually delivered directly to his house.

Juan Flavier observes (emphasis mine):

> Somehow there must be a possibility of blending the best in an
> albularyo and the best in a medical doctor---**medical science to
> modernize the albularyo, and the albularyo to humanize medical
> science.**

## Barrio philosophy

Some [Filipino values](/filipino-values) from a rural wisdom:

1. Forget not to pay respects and give gratitude to whence one came.
2. Hard work can maintain, if not elevate, one's present way of living.
3. Seek enough knowledge and experience from which one can draw
   faith---in oneself, in one's community, and even in the divine powers
   that be---to sustain one's future.

## Miscellaneous info

- *Buho* is an indigenous variety of [bamboo](/bamboo) which is so tough
  "rats can't bite through it," and is used to make huge baskets
  (*matong*) for transporting palay.
- Milk can be ulam everywhere and everywhen. I first saw it on my
  mother. Then I have heard other people do it, too! I think it can be
  nutritious and yummy if gotten fresh from a cattle and poured over
  rice. Isn't that quite similar to champorado?
