The academia is all about respectability.

It shouldn't be the limiting factor, though,
for one to contribute to the sum of human knowledge.

Accountability practices are also limited in academia. In many cases,
academic institutions have done nothing in scandals but to protect their
name.

## Questioning the role of academia

I wonder if it's better to be a scholar outside of traditional, more
structured academia, getting only backing from [community](/community) like friends
and family with whom I have personal stakes in. Certainly, there are
hidden nuggets of wisdom and maybe science in the daily life, not just
within university walls, when one is willing to tinker, to ask the
questions, to look stupid once in a while, all in pursuit of learning
more about the world we live in and sharing your findings with the
public.

David Edgerton and Terence Kealey both quiestion the link (if any)
between academic science and economic prosperity. Are we to believe that
universities are repositories of knowledge? Or can we also access
knowledge outside of academia, and contribute even to the betterment of
society?
