- Added another laptop to the [list of refurbished ones](/refurbishing-laptops).
- And other minor site design edits.

## Right knee

Almost one month to date after the anomaly, the discomfort/pain in my
right knee comes back, milder this time.

Leg days might be limited to calf raises and an easier variation of
Nordic curl, but certainly not skipping [it altogether].

## Colder days and nights

Is it a blessing to have colder days and nights ahead? Would that mean
lower monthly electric bill?

I certainly prefer this over the hot summer days.

## Field trip at Marikina City

Recently, we went on a field trip to the city.

This is also our annual excuse to eat at [our favorite paresan](/239).
Even though they have hiked up their prices since we were last here, the
food tasted a better this time.

I saw at two different KFC stores being constructed on two different
locations within the city.
