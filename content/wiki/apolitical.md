"Not everything is political."

Sure, there
is a gram of truth to it; no menace, like [politics](/politics) is,
can be omnipresent.

But in the expanding Global Digitalization governed by States and
Capitalists and other tyrants of oppression, [appropriating my data](/privacy),
the gist of Me, without my consent
will always be political. And that's just one thing to get agitated
about.

We are suffering from multiple crises:
- Israel conducting genocide against Palestinian people
- Climate catastrophes due to effects of climate change
- Rise of [fascism](/fascism) all over the world
- [Societal collapse](/collapse)

We simply cannot afford to be neutral about it. In fact, you might
already be talking about political things in your daily life without
your noticing it.

Have you complained about the effects of inflation and the rising of
prices of everyday necessities?

Have you complained about how the [local] government seems to be not
doing anything to address natural disasters?

Even in the mundane things like greeting your neighbor good morning, you
are reinforcing, however little its effect, the sense of community,
which in itself can be a political act when the time is right. And guess
what, the time is always right for these kinds of "small acts".

So long as our interconnected freedoms are tangled within the oppressive
forces of powers that be, we have the right to be political in our every
move. Because politics cannot be monopolized by State, lest we entrust
our lives solely to them and the Capitalists that they really serve.
