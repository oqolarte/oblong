The notes below are ideas and reflections after reading Kristian
William's [*Resist Everything Except Temptation*](/241/#resist-everything), which is a look into
Wilde's anarchist philosophy. Each paragraph is a stand-alone note.

On [art](/art): Wilde believes artists and their will flourish outside the State's control.

On state: He suggests that if a state should exist, its function is to
make and provide useful things and services, and distribute them to
people. The role of people, then, is to do the creative work that makes
life worth living. Sadly, I know of no state that voluntarily do this.
But more importantly, do we even need a large faceless being like a
State to do this for us?

At some point in his life, Wilde was elitist, sexist, racist,
misogynistic, and anti-Semitic. My considering him as a "spirit guide"
of sorts allows me to see and know his flaws, to not imbibe them, and
hopefully learn from his mistakes by unlearning these things if/when
they make themselves apparent in my life. With that, author Kristian
William argues that Wilde has infused art, philosophy, and
[politics](/politics) into all of his works, and failing to recognize
this, we will fail to understand the essence of Wilde's vision.

## On propaganda of the deed

Oscar Wilde was alive around the time of when anarchists were
"expressing" their politics through propaganda of the deed. Propaganda
of the deed, at the time, were [violent direct actions](/violence) meant
to sendmessage to the ruling class. According to Sergei Mikhailovich
Kravchinskii (AKA Stepniak), a terrorist is a combined martyr and hero.
But he forgot to mention the secret ingredient: denying innocent
bystanders their safety, and even causing them harm, in the name of
forwarding the agenda. The martyrdom is an essential component of
terrorism, as we should know in the context of 21st century war crimes;
it leads the terrorist to believe that they will be absolved of sins
eventually.

## Commenting on the current society to imagine a new one

Wilde, in his own way, had tried [to prefigure](/prefiguration) the
society he wanted to live in by commenting on the one he lived in.

He also knew that most, if not all, dirty jobs have no dignity in the
labor required to accomplish it. If the technology were already
available for most people then, he would have suggested that such jobs
be [fully automated](/automation). For Wilde, it's important for a
worker to love the work that they do to produce a good output. And this
is difficult, if not impossible, for menial labor. Love for work comes
from allowing the worker to be creative, to design the beauty of their
craft. This sense of ownership, Wilde believed, would make the workers
more than just machines. If we, too, would believe this, then the great
thinker and philosopher is in the daily people of working class, those
we meet in the streets: he's the driver of a public transport
vehicle; she's the Yakult vendor strolling around the neighborhood; they
are the "unruly" kids who skate in the urban jungle on nights, and the
security guards who tell them off. The most beautiful art, therefore,
can only come from the working class; from creating, not possessing.

Rajiv Surendra, modern Renaissance man, argues for [why you should use your nicest things every day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClAqiBqqtu0): "[U]se them every
single day, because not only will they enrich your life, but they'll
actually get better." More than a
century prior, Wilde shared a similar sentiment after realizing there is
beauty in Chinese people and their art: "Beautiful things for everyday
use are what we want.... Beauty should be as free as the air and water,
and then it cannot fail to leave its impression on all minds."

Wilde's brand of individualism stems from how a person fully develops
themself to their greatest potentioal, not isolated from the society as
a lone wolf, but as an integral part of it. In fact, an individual would
not reach their best self if it weren't for the villages that nurtured
them.

## On love

Marriage---what is its real function other than to legally and
financially bind two (or more, such as the case in some [cultures](/culture))
people? It can't be all about [love](/love) because in reality, romantic
love [can't be sustained by a single person](/non-monogamy). It
[d]evolves into something after some years or decades of togetherness.
When describing their relationship with their spouse, a relative of mine
once said, "It's like you become [very close] siblings." Now, while
that's ~~incest~~ intense, more empowering is freedom, i.e., freedom is
what makes love possible. Marriage and love have nothing in common.

## Imprisoned yet unbroken

When Oscar Wilde was tried and incarcerated for homosexuality and
alleged prostitution, he realized it was a mistake to have appealed to
the society that put him in prison. If we
[seek to abolish all wprisons](/abolition)
and [the empire that funds them](/empire), should
we rely on their tools of oppression? That's sketchy at best.

Then and now, the process of "settling in" a convict has been one of
slow dehumanization, initiated and blessed by no other than the state.
Prison reformists have argued that the prison industrial complex has
been more humane now, but I think they mean that the dehumanization rate
*might* have been slower now, which is still debatable. Prisons have sucked, to
say the least, since Day 0.

He observed, after his release from prison, "Authority is as destructive
to those who exercise it as it is those whom it is exercised." Which
Mikhail Bakunin echoed: "We are in fact enemies of all authority, for we
realize that power and authority corrupt those who exercise them as much
as those who are compelled to submit to them."

## As a rebel

Moralists and martyr worshippers both want the rebel to be punished.
The former wants to highlight the wrongness of rebel's existence; the
latter wants to show that the punishment is wrong. Both camps are
willing to forgo scrutinizing the nuances of the rebel's life, because
doing so doesn't serve their agenda.

Up until the end of his life, the author shows that Oscar Wilde remained
a rebel in his own right.
