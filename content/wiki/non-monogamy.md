In a society of jealousy and ownership,
non-monogamy challenges assumptions
on intimate relationships---romantic, [sexual](/sex),
and everything [in between](/friendship) and [beyond](/community).

[Do we love more than our friends/loved ones](/love)?
And do we take care of more than the people we love?
If the answer is "no one"
then it might well be [revolutionary love](/revolution).

Non-monogamous lovers see love as something that only increases in
richness and depth by being shared freely, but not necessarily recklessly
as they still [communicate](/communication) regularly about [consent](/consent).

Haven't you noticed how capitalism leads us to believe that anything of value
is only limited in supplies? Your The One is just that---a single person
out of the billions. So either that's practically improbable, or there's
something wrong with limiting our loves to *a* person.

Cheating (in a relationship) is as wrong as theft. They are both wrong
in that the actor violated consent. But the situation in which the actor
found themself has already existed as a byproduct of oppressive systems
brought by [Empire](/empire). To forgive these crimes, we must fully
[transform everything](/transformative-justice).

## Meaningful interactions

State and its bureaucracy, and [Capitalism](/capitalism)
discourage meaningful interaction.

Are you friends with the cashier at your grocery store?
In [r/antiwork](https://old.reddit.com/r/antiwork) subreddit,
a lot of people there will remind you to consider carefully
if you're planning to befriend your coworkers.
Impersonal relationships abound,
which leads us to easily hate on each other.

And if we found ourselves loving, we put a put a valve on it to regulate
its flow and volume. Can we ever pour ourselves out *and* let others in
fully this way?
