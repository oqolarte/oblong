- Edited one or two lines in the [Support](/support/) page.
- Added a page, called [Ideas of Possible Projects](/di-why/), where such list is found.
Right now, the page can be accessed through the Support page, this log, and by memory (adding `/di-why` at the end of the base URL).
- Added Dan Luu's blog as another inspiration for this [Site](/site).
Also added a service for those who may want to subscribe to RSS by email.
- Changed the site's logo to something... *larger*.
I used the [Hundred Rabbit's Dotgrid](https://100r.co/site/dotgrid.html) tool to create it, which in my opinion is great!
Expect that I will play with drawing software.
- On the Index, my CV can now be viewed as a page in this website without having to donwload the PDF.
I also updated a line in the footer.

I know it's getting harder to focus one thing at a time in this Age of Information.
I know, because I suffer from the same problem day in and day out.
Not much to it, really.
I use the term "suffer" but it feels more like decadent lethargy.
*If you can do the same thing with less effort, do it!*
I often tell myself.

In the same vein, could being lazy, and possibly helping others settle into their own brand of Laziness, be a career path?
Of course, it has to be rebranded, like:
**Help people get the most useful {info, thing, experience, XYZ} in the shortest time possible.**

I keep on reading and hearing about this Pomodoro technique for years now.
Perhaps, it's a viable solution to my waning and waxing attention span.

Hyperconnectivity allows us to access different people, different stuff from different points most of the time, and yet it can't necessarily nourish us.
Is it more likely that it instead drains us?

It is March now.
Heat starts to become unbearable.
We've been meaning to have an aircon unit in our room, and today it is now installed.

Who would have thought that we're nearing the anniversary of a lockdown?
To commemorate this wonderful event, we've downloaded Katamari Damacy on Isya's old/new laptop.
I'm thinking of completing the game 100%.
