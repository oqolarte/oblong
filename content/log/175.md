Peak Aries season---my people is deemed to be a chaotic bunch. I don't
disagree: I myself am a self-proclaimed [chaotic good](/26/#chaotic-good).

## Chewing on past three decades in few paragraphs

Many people around my age would claim that 90s is the best decade ever,
and often they would wonder why it had to end? For me, that's a bold
claim to make. I understand that some of the good parts are
really good in my opinion,
but there's no real way for me to say for sure that is
*the* best years. I was, in fact, too young to know anything, save for
the courage to daydream, to project unto the world what I had imagined
in my silly head as a child from a relatively poor family.

I have been bored most of my life, and ancient wisdom suggests that it's
okay for one to be so. Boredom forces the mind to create something from
scratch. Too, I have been a boring person. As a mild people-pleaser,
I claim that this inert dullness comes from years of
practicing [*wu wei*](/68/#on-time), but to be honest, I'm stretching it.

One friend---bless their sharp words for they heal---said, indirectly,
that what I'm feeling, this sense of helplessness and wanting to move
but unable to, can be correlated to my lack of community that inspires
and motivates me. Well, I hope it's not too late to join, maintain,
or create new ones.

## Artificial Eclipse

I don't know if there's a term for this phenomenon, but for now, let's
call it Artificial Eclipse, and is as follows: when the observer, who is
usually in a moving body (e.g., car, train, vehicle, ship, etc.) is
trying to look at a static object in the distance (e.g., billboard,
building, tree, etc.), but a second closer *and* moving object (blocker) blocks
the view. The blocker keeps on eclipsing the view as it moves at a rate
relative to the observer. It becomes [mildly?] infuriating for the
observer when the view they were trying to look at is no longer within
field of vision for some reason, usually because they have moved past it.
