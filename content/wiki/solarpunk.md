## Intro

Solarpunk started out as a movement in speculative fiction, [art](/art),
[fashion](/fashion), and [activism](/activism) that seeks to answer and
embody the question “what does a
[sustainable civilization](/social-ecology) look like, and how can we get there?”

It's a hopeful rendition of the future in which [appropriate technology](https://www.appropedia.org/Appropriate_technology),
renewable energy, and sustainable living practices [empower us to build communities](/mutual-aid) that we want to live in.

Solarpunk, like cyberpunk, steampunk and adjacent
-punk movements, deeply examines how [technology](/technology)
has affected our lives,
and how might we imagine it continue doing so,
but in a more optimistic way.

## Work in Solarpunk

Knowledge workers may have to re-train
to learn skills for manual trades
if we ever desire this solarpunk future.

Moreover, when you think about it,
we cannot import, outsource, and offshore all of our needs.

Growing our own food,
repairing our own stuff,
riding our [bikes](/bike)---these
physical activities would mostly likely be grounded
outside of the digital space where knowledge workers
mostly do their work.

Right now, it's hard to say what kinds of work would be obsolete in the
future, as it depends on the values and priorities of any society, as
well as the technological and economic realities of that time.

The simple table below is a prediction on
what kinds of work would and wouldn't be present
in this imagined future:

| Meaningful work                              | Meaningless work                    |
| ---------------                              | ----------------                    |
| Using renewable resource                     | Extracting non-renewable resources  |
| Preserving and enhancing natural environment | Constructing new infrastructure     |
| [Permaculture](/permaculture)                | Monoculture                         |
| Manufacturing life-long products             | Manufacturing single-use products   |
| [Repairing](/repair) / Upcycling stuff       | Designing products for obsolescence |


## Solarpunk in the Philippine archipelago

A solarpunk society in [the Philippine archipelago](/pilipinas)
could potentially
thrive by leveraging the region's natural resources and favorable
climate[^sea] to support the widespread adoption of renewable energy sources
such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power.

[^sea]: That is, if the seas haven't risen yet to swallow our coastal
regions and submerging low-lying cities.

Our energy demand can be managed at the community level. This might mean
installing small-scale solar panels and wind turbines on rooftops, as
well as developing microgrids.

## Is Solarpunk [absurd](/absurdism)?

It's understandable to be skeptical of a utopian vision of future. After
all, we know if it's too good to be true, it likely is. But we also have
to welcome any and all reactions to dystopian imaginations that have
come out of the fear of climate change. We need a vision of the world
with everyone and everything in it that is inspiring to get to.

Such visions should inspire us to create and mold
[better communities](/community) now.
While it's impossible to achieve a perfect society
(which is subjective really),
living the [revolution](/revolution) in the present
will lead to a more equitable environment for future generations.

## Sample Projects

- [The Crack Garden](https://www.asla.org/2009awards/330.html)
  "reveal[s] the potential for beauty that underlies the concrete and
  asphalt that is the predominant ground plane material of the urban
  landscape [...] By eliminating portions of the existing concrete and
  exposing the soil beneath, potential is released, and new
  opportunities for the garden arise."
- [Ground Fridge](https://groundfridge.com/) "keeps fresh produce
  deliciously fresh without any electricity."
- [Solar-powered Website](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2023/06/rebuilding-a-solar-powered-website/)
  is an interesting proof-of-concept on how we might share information
  via internet that's solar-powered.
- Digging crescent-shaped holes can catch rainwater and reverse
  desertification by making the land hospitable.

- [On the Political Dimensions of Solarpunk](https://medium.com/solarpunks/on-the-political-dimensions-of-solarpunk-c5a7b4bf8df4):
  2015 article that still holds up reasonably well
- In the essay "[Cozy sci-fi and why we can't have nice things](https://tadaima.bearblog.dev/cozy-sci-fi-and-why-we-cant-have-nice-things/)",
  the author touches upon "imagin[ing] a utopia that's bright and
  positive" and yet remaining firm that books (and any work of
  speculative fiction for that matter) "should still have a strong story
  and strong characters."
