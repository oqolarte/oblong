I started the New Year fuming. Loud and disturbing firecrackers could do
that to me. Nursing anger is not a good way to start the year, I know,
and I do not intend to stay that way for long periods of time.

What I really intend to be more of this coming year is **Useful**:

- to myself by improving my [health](/health) and/or maintaining any
  gains made;
- to my loved ones by being there for them physically and/or
  emotionally;
- to the world at large by, at the very least, causing the least
  possible harm.

I know it will not be easy, what with all the inner lives wanting to
surface and man the flesh.
