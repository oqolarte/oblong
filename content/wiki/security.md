Our security is only as good as the humans that "maintain" it.

Security Mindset encourages a different way of looking at the world
around us: to get into the thinking of a would-be bad actor and how can
the current systems, [including digital systems](/cybersecurity), in
place be exploited; to question the norms and assumptions. For example,
how can we [better talk to each other in private](/cryptography)?

Not that we plan on doing something bad, but rather the opposite. By
trying to identify a system's weaknesses, we get closer at making it
more secure. Teaching designers how a system might fail is just as
important as thinking about how they will work.

Security, in any context, is not something one adds on ad hoc.
It has to be included in all stages of development and implementation.

[Technologies](/technology) change rapidly.
And yet, some hackers don't even have to be that tech-savvy to infiltrate a
system. If they could get in by playing on one's good nature,
it's [social engineering](/social-engineering).

If more people had a security mindset,
the world as we know it now would be safer and more secure,
even as technologies evolve in ways we haven't begun to imagine yet.
