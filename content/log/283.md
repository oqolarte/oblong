It is impossible to control everything. To perfect each little detail
that comes our way, even more so. Come to think of it, many of us are
even finding it hard to control our emotions sometimes. What more the
invisible little threads that tug at every particle in this universe?

And so, I have been learning when to let go. Be bothered only the right
amount, as the Stoics would say. In letting go---of perfection, of
making mistakes, etc.---I gain some wisdom. Honestly, I am still not
there yet. I am still not wise enough, so to speak. But I appreciate
that this might be Nature's way of balancing human emotions: getting and
losing of abstract pieces that enrich Living.

It is okay to pursue things I like, to create for the sake of it, even
if the end result might not be great. In making something, I learn and
gain something wonderful. The process teaches valuable insights. So,
learn to embrace it.

The goal, then, is to not monetize and succumb to the machine. Human
expression is in itself already a lofty journey worth going through.
