Found and been trying [whoBIRD](https://github.com/woheller69/whoBIRD)
in our yard for days now. So far, it has brought names to the birds we
have already seen visiting, perching on branches:

- Eurasian tree sparrow
- Philippine pied-fantail
- Arctic warbler
- Olive-backed sunbird
- Black-naped oriole
