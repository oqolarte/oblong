I like it when people say something about their "leaning into anarchy"
when talking about the end of the world as we know it, because of
several things:

- I honestly hope they would lean into it. Imagine unleashing all the
  joy, tapping all the potential trapped within, empowering other people
  they care about. To do that, though, they must first realize what
  anarchy truly means; but
- "Anarchy" may sound more sophisticated than "chaos" but it is
  the latter to which they are actually committing (anarchy is not
  necessarily chaos); and
- It's like being on an inside joke with them where only I know what's
  funny about it.
