## Special Mentions

- [Fedora Workstation](https://getfedora.org/en/workstation/) -- The
  first Linux distro I used. Also currently using the [Budgie
  Spin](https://fedoraproject.org/spins/budgie) to run on an old laptop
  repurposed to be a media center.
- [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org/) -- The one I used in [the Old Computer Challenge](/old-computer)
- [Devuan 5 "Daedalus"](https://www.devuan.org/os/announce/daedalus-release-announce-2023-08-14)
  -- is a Debian-fork OS without systemd that used to be in my main
  computer before distro-hopping[^distro-hopping] to Alpine.
- [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org) -- For when I need to be
  anonymous on the internet. I don't use this much, but I have it just
  in case.
- [Firefox](https://www.firefox.com/) -- not a fan of the direction they are heading, but
  they are still a major player in web browser space.
    - Browser add-ons: uBlock Origin, Redirector, SponsorBlock, Privacy
      Badger, Wayback Machine
    - Redirector set-up: [JSON file](/Redirector.json) (includes Scribe,
      Rural Dictionary, rimgo, Quetre)
- [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/) - GUI email client I had used
  and is just reliable, though can be bloated at times.

[^distro-hopping]: The act of frequently changing the OS of one's
computer to a different distribution of
[Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux), *usually* as a hobby.

## Why?

Is the software you use...:
- backed by venture capital (VC) funding?
- maintained by Big Tech companies?

If so, know that this will pose different problems in the future, if it
hasn't already yet. Companies ultimately are driven by profit incentive,
and at one point, they will want to collect. It can be in the form of
unfair subscription payment models,
[enshittification](https://pluralistic.net/2024/04/24/naming-names/#more-8578)
of their services, privacy-invasive data gathering methods, etc.

As much as possible, I want to use FOSS (i.e., free and open source
software) for all my software needs. I believe FOSS empowers me to
accomplish digital tasks that don't cage me in a paid walled garden
and/or surveil my every move.

{{< figure src="/image/foss-venn.png" alt="Venn Diagram showing the intersection of 3 characteristics of a software: good, fair, legal. All three is what FOSS represents. Good and legal is usually privacy-invasive. Good and fair is piracy. Fair and legal software: 'Why are you using it?'" caption="Venn Diagram generator by classtools.net" >}}

### ...why not?

It can be hard to choose FOSS, especially if Big Tech companies are
embedded in our digital lives now (e.g., at work, employer forces you to
use Microsoft Office Suite), whether we like it or not.

At schools, are we teaching students how to use computers, or are we
teaching them how to use products from Microsoft, Google, Adobe, and
other big tech companies? When these are baked into the curriculum early
on, it makes opting into FOSS alternatives feel like a burden than just
using what you already know (in this case, products from Microsoft,
Google, Adobe, etc.).

## Final thoughts

I try not to get obsessed, though, on picking the right tools.
There's no perfect tool, and even the great ones will not save you;
how you use them might.
