- Done with *Dune*; on to *Dune Messiah* (Frank Herbert).

## Brief review of *Dune*

People talk about *Dune* by Frank Herbert far and wide, and if one finds
oneself around hardcore sci-fi fans, the reports are as varied and wide
as Herbert's world-building.

It is *slow burn* yet fast-paced as evidenced by its voluminous yet tight
prose. But it needs to be, because it sets up the following books in the
saga (there are six, including this first book).

Admittedly, having watched the 2021 and 2024 film adaptations (*Dune* in
two parts) helped me visualize appreciate Arrakis better. Of course,
there is the usual "The Book Is Better" discourse to be had, but in all
fairness to the films, they did okay in capturing the nuances of the
rise to power of Muad'Dib.

Read if you like: science fiction that is spiced with human
complexities like religion and politics.

Some of my other exposures to *Dune* before even reading it:
- A video game called [*Dune 2000*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_2000) that I neither played nor enjoyed being exposed to.
- [Fatboy Slim ft. Bootsy Collins - Weapon Of Choice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCDIYvFmgW8): "Walk without rhythm and it won't attract the worm" lyrics and Christopher Walken who would eventually play the role Emperor in Dune Part Two (2024) film.

## Flu

I was out of commission this weekend as the annual flu has come to me.
Weather not only did not help, I feel like it made my sickness worse.
Fluctuating between scorched and drenched earth is never conducive to a
healthy environment.

Still recuperating; as historical data suggests, it would be many days
before I am fully well.

Being bedridden was what actually allowed me to finally finish reading
*Dune*! So at least there is that.
