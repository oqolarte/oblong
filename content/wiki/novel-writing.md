## Snowflake Method

[Write a novel using the snowflake method](https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/).

and gradually adding more details,
characters,
and richness to the plot
as you go along,
like how a triangle can fractally become a snowflake in
[Koch Snowflake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake).
