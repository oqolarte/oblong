As we continue to navigate the digital spaces,
we must be aware of the bits of information,
or crumbs if you will, that we leave behind.
And how access to this information can be used in many different ways.

## Safety & Security Mindfulness

We have an anarchistic bias for “information wants to be free”.
But we need to be aware of info hazards.
Remember: information = knowledge = tool = power.

When you divulge information, think about:
- what power are you granting
- to whom
- over what/whom?
- and why?

Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is protected by law (GDPR, DPA).
However, the law does not value the individual but the volume.
We need to be ethically ahead of the law.
And even more so for activities that go against it.

[Consent](/consent) is key.
Information about someone is power over someone.
This is how trust grows as people learn more about each other.
[To divulge your information](/communication) is to be vulnerable.
When we exhibit care when dealing with privileged information,
trust grows.

How do you recognize when you are “not at liberty”
to use/share a piece of information?
Is it private vs. public?
Is the nature of the space or the content therein particularly sensitive?
You might want to consider whether
a piece of info is subversive, personal, health, finance, etc.,
depending on the context,
and [what would be its effect](/second-order-thinking).

## Metadata is still data

Metadata is data about *the* [data](/data-management).
For example,
the image in a picture is the data;
its dimensions,
the date, time, and place it was taken, and by whom,
would be the picture's metadata.

Even if a piece of info has
no identity (“I heard x from someone”)
or no content (“I talked to x”),
I still divulges some information.
Now they know that you have access (direct or otherwise)
to a specific space
or connections with a specific person.
This may have important political implications
for certain people or groups with
certain internal dynamics.
Even more important if you have a dedicated adversarial agent
with significant resources (e.g. the state)
to map your information network.

## Tips for mindfulness

1. Try to slow down when dealing with “juicy” or particularly exciting information.
2. Flip the script/try on their shoes.
Imagine swapping yourself with each person involved in what you are
about to share (e.g. dropping a name, telling a story):
    - would you have any misgivings about what you were thinking of
      sharing?
    - did they give clear prior consent for sharing this information?
    - if it was implicit, is that a safe and reasonable assumption to
      make?
    - if there is any doubt, better to err on the side of caution and
      ask for explicit consent first
