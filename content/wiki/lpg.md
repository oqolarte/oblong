The LPG facts below came from a previous life when I was still in Oil
and Gas industry.

- LPG in its natural state is vapor.
- It is controlled via pressure and temperature.
- Any increase in temperature or decrease in pressure, it becomes
  liquid.
- It must be contained a closed system; LPG will go out of any opening
  it finds.
- Mixture of propane and butane; 40/60 or 30/70 propane-butane
  proportion
- We don't need pure propane as this requires high pressure and/or
  refrigeration.
- LPG ignited in open space causes flash fire.
- Containers must be spherical (no corners), for equal distribution of
  pressure.
- Any pump servicing for LPG must always be primed.
- Any compressor servicing for LPG must always be dry.
- Before operation, bleed the compressor first to drain it from possible
  condensation.
- Liquid transfer can be done by vapor differential pressure.
- Vapor recovery means to get the pressure back to its initial state (of
  the loading vessel).
- Compressor must be installed in well ventilated area.
- During operation: cold pipe is suction; warm pipe is discharge.
  Flexible connections is recommended, instead of black iron (BI) or
  galvanized iron (GI) pipes.
- External safety valve (pneumatic) is recommended for tanks; internal
  safety valve (hydraulic) for bullet tank trucks.
- Flaring is burning of remaining LPG in a degassed tank.
- LPG is odorless. Ethyl methyl is added to detect the smell.
- TIG weld is used for all pipes servicing for LPG.
- Be sure to conduct no-load test first.
- Check start up voltage of the motor.
- Vane type pumps = with blades
- Impeller pumps = caterpillar looking (low capacity, high differential;
  currently being phased out)
- By-pass valve prevents motor overload.
- Use inlet line larger than pump suction nozzle.
- Use eccentric reducer to avoid vaporization.
- Check valve is used so that pump is always primed!
- Pump is sloped down by about 1% of the length of pipe from tank truck.
- Weight of load (including pump and pipes) must be considered when
  designing foundation.
