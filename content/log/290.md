Our small cargo utility bike[^cub]
([CUB](https://www.facebook.com/p/Compact-Utility-Bike-100063712492024/)
(Facebook)) needed an important repair. Each time I ride it, somewhere
along the crank arm and bottom bracket was a clicking and creaking
sound.

Today, I finally found time to have this sketchy issue repaired.

As I approached our trusted bike shop, I asked the woman behind the
glass counter in Tagalog, "Is there a mechanic?"

Then, behind her appeared the familiar man. He made his way to me and
the CUB. I noticed his hands were both black with grease, perhaps from
an earlier repair. As far as I know, he is the only mechanic in this
shop, while woman (his wife? not sure) is both the cashier and the admin
manager.

The mechanic was snacking on chips (with his bare greasy hands, mind
you) and coke as I explained to him the issue. With a cool nod and
smile, he began to set up his "workstation"---a constellation of tools,
nuts, and bolts either on the floor or low-rise tables, all within arm's
reach. His phone appears from a pocket and he paired the audio with a
bluetooth speaker. After a few quick taps, a series of grunge 90s rock,
starting with Nirvana's "Come As You Are", emanated into open shop, no
thanks to Spotify Free and its annoying ads. A stick of Marlboro Red
perched between his lips and he made sure to light it before sitting on
a low bench to examine further the task at hand.

He got to work. He confirmed my suspicion that the issue was indeed in
the bottom bracket, but clarified that it needed to be replaced with a
new one. The mechanic paced himself, *taking his time*. He would sing to
some parts of some songs as he applied torque on levers where necessary.

More customers were coming, but they would have to wait: while the mechanic was
now in the flow, he was not hurrying up. I imagine him enjoying this
work: honest, intellectually stimulating, and quite hands-on. Whether it
pays decently is another discussion.

It took him about 45 minutes to finish the replacement, for a whopping
PHP 378, including labor and good dadbod muzak. I thanked him by tipping a
small amount, but by then he was already attending to the next customer.

[^cub]: According to its maker, Alex Silva, "This is a 'frontloader'
type of cargo bike. It is compact because it is shorter than the regular
car."
