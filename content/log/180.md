Perhaps it's the unbearable heat that is upon us that's making me
re-evaluate my positions in life lately. You see, I can't think without
feeling and feel without thinking. Thinking and feeling are often
separated in modern discourse. Some people assume that it's healthy to
air-gap emotion from reason. I was from this camp, but I'm now slowly
unlearning that needless division. Supposedly, the brain's operation
should be isolated from that of the heart's, but even anatomically, that
doesn't spell good; one needs the other to work well. We want them to
work well. If/when I experience joy, I imagine it would be akin to
setting my feelings and thoughts on fire, weeding out the old to make
way for new transformations, the ashes a fertile ground for newer ways
of Being.
