## On Helping Strangers

If and when you can, help strangers.[^ask]
Even if it's for "selfish" reason
("I feel good helping them"),
or selfless ("I hope they feel good"),
it doesn't matter.
It nets positive in any case.

Yesterday, Isya and I helped a kid fix the flat tire of his BMX.

Earlier this afternoon, we met a woman having trouble figuring out how to fold
a foldable platform trolley.
I taught her how:
step on the rod (spring-loaded) that's on the bottom edge of the handle.
This disengages the lock,
allowing the handle to fold onto the platform.

[^ask]: Needless to say, always ask first if they need and/or want help.
