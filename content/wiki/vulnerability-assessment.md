Vulnerability assessments are internal reviews of an organization's
[security systems](/security) to identify and fix weaknesses; and the
insights gleaned from that will be used to design defense strategies,
which in turn will be evaluated by using [penetration testing](/pen-test).

[Vulnerability scanning tools](/vulnerability-scanning) are commonly used to simulate threats by
finding vulnerabilities in an attack surface.

## Steps in assessment

1. **Identification**: scanning tools and manual testing are used to
   find vulnerabilities. During this step, the goal is to understand the
   current state of a security system, like taking a picture of it. A
   large number of findings usually appear after identification.
2. **Vulnerability analysis**: each of the vulnerabilities that were
   identified are tested. The goal of is to find the source of the
   problem.
3. **Risk assessment**: A score is assigned to each vulnerability. This
   score is assigned based on two factors: how severe the impact would
   be if the vulnerability were to be exploited and the likelihood of
   this happening. Vulnerabilities uncovered during the first two steps
   of this process often outnumber the people available to fix them.
   Risk assessments are a way of prioritizing resources to handle the
   vulnerabilities that need to be addressed based on their score.
4. **Remediation**: Here, the vulnerabilities that can impact the
   organization are addressed. Remediation occurs depending on the
   severity score assigned during the risk assessment step. This part of
   the process is normally a joint effort between the security staff and
   IT teams to come up with the best approach to fixing the
   vulnerabilities that were uncovered earlier. Examples of remediation
   steps might include things like enforcing new security procedures,
   updating operating systems, or implementing system patches.

## Importance of updates

For consumers, updates provide improvements to performance, stability,
and even new features. But from a security standpoint, they serve a
specific purpose. Updates allow organizations to address security
vulnerabilities that can place their users, devices, and networks at
risk. They usually take place after a vulnerability assessment, which is
the internal review process of an organization's security systems.

An outdated [computer](/computer) is a lot like a house with unlocked
doors. Malicious actors use these gaps in security the same way, to gain
unauthorized access. Software updates are similar to locking the doors
to keep them out.

A **patch update** is a software and operating system update that
addresses security vulnerabilities within a program or product. Patches
usually contain bug fixes that address common security vulnerabilities
and exposures.

**Note**: Ideally, patches address common vulnerabilities and exposures
before malicious hackers find them. However, patches are sometimes
developed as a result of a zero-day.
