## Multi-level issue

War on drugs is actually an intersection of multiple issues:

- **Class issue**: War on drugs is anti-poor. Only rich people get
  away if they are caught.
- **Gender issue**: Women experience more gendered
  abuses/forms of [violence](/violence) from the police for being drug users,
  drug pushers, or simply by being family members of drug users and/or
  pushers.
- **Healthcare/disability issue**: Marginalized people use illegal
  drugs as a means to access healthcare.
- **Labor issue**: People use illegal drugs to endure inhumane
  working conditions---long hours of physical and mental labor.
- **Education issue**: People get involve in the drug trade because
  they didn't have access to the level of education to enable them to
  find other legal ways of surviving.

## Dehumanizing people

The easiest way to dehumanize people, more so in post-Duterte era, is
to say they use illegal drugs. Media is also responsible for
indictment of drug users because everytime someone is arrested for
crime, especially rape or murder; they report that the suspects are drug
users. Drug users are conveniently the best scapegoat to take away
accountability from government for the daily violence we experience:
when you blame a problem to the drug users, no more questions asked.
