Music this year may have been neglected for number of reasons. By that,
I mean I haven't been exploring music as much as I wanted to, always
resorting to the tunes that, as a nostaljunkie, feel familiar, reliable
to the point where I know a song would soothe me.

Despite that, below is a recap of all the stuff I listened to this year
