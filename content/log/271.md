I have nothing more to add to the din when it comes to commenting about
the circus of the Elections 2025. I am getting second-hand reports from
my friends about their social media feeds: mostly rabid liberals who
could now muscle-up with all the mental gymnastics they have done in
justifying their vote for lesser evils. I guess I should not be
surprised that *anyone* is capable of that to further their agenda, no
matter the context.

I sent my thoughts on
[voting](/voting) to some people close to me; and the reception, I
think, great.

In another lifetime, humans would be exploring other ways of social
interaction: more humane, more egalitarian, and not necessarily needing
[democracy](/democracy) the way we currently know it. Until
then, I should accept that maybe, elections are our trash beauty
pageants that do have some implications.
