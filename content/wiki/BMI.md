BMI was invented by Adolphe Quetelet, the 19th century statistician who
invented phrenologist anthropometry. He wasnâ€™t just a eugenicist, he was
one of the founding fathers of racist pseudoscience.

BMI, unfortunately, doesn't tell the whole story.
BMI doesn't separate data from muscle mass and body fat,
so one might have a normal BMI,
but still looks thin with above-average fat.
Worse, one might have "normal weight obesity"
and still act and feel healthy.

To amend this, increase muscle mass by:
1. Strength Training (I do bodyweights/[calisthenics](/calisthenics))
2. Proper [Nutrition](/nutrition)
