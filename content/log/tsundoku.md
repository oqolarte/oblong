- Changed the status of [Encoding](/encode/) project
from **on-going** to **done**.

[*Tsundoku*](https://duckduckgo.com/l/?uddg=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FTsundoku) (積ん読) becomes our mode of expressing ourselves here.
How we decorate the blank spaces with books of various interests.
It's because the many books that we acquire that we have not touched and are piled up together are for sale at:

[**Always Carry A Book**](https://alwayscarry.netlify.app), a mantra that we follow only when it's convenient, and less than one kilogram. 

We can only gloss over them as we put them up on the store one by one.

As for the many more books that already have that aren't for sale, well, they shall remain dusty until we find time to pick them up.
