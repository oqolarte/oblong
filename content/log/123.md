## Clout Chasing

The marathon to chase clout goes on in many social media sites.
As many people race to come up with the [wittiest quips](/99)
and hottest takes,
who has time to pause and consider that nuance matters?
When it's easy to make sweeping generalizations about anything really,
thinking before clicking is that thin line between hard work and supernatural.

I'm generally an impatient person,
something that I've been working on.
That's why I kind of understand why people eager
to have quick say on a matter,
a first impression,
an initial review.

However, it's something that I'll question daily.
Not to exactly to rant about it,
but to hopefully to learn more about myself as I reflect on these.

## Holy Week, 2023

We stayed at home when most of the "main characters"[^mc] of Metro Manila
rushed out of town to spend the holidays with bodies of water.
Not going with the crowd is always a good decision;
staycation is bit better.
