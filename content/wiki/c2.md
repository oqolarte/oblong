Command and Control Infrastructure, also known as C2 or C&C, is the set
of tools and techniques that [attackers](/threat-actor) use to maintain
communication with compromised devices following initial exploitation.

## Part of cyber kill chain

Right after [persistence in the cyber kill chain](/cyber-kill-chain/#persistence),
the attacker opens up command and control channel through the malware to
remotely control and manipulate the target system.

### Common C2 channels

Common C2 channels used by attackers include:

- The protocols HTTP on port 80 and HTTPS on port 443: This type of
  beaconing blends the malicious traffic with the legitimate traffic and
  can help the attacker evade [firewalls](/firewall).
- DNS (Domain Name Server): The infected machine makes constant DNS
  requests to the DNS server that belongs to an attacker, also known as
  DNS Tunneling.

[DDoS attack](/dos-attack). Botnets are common arsenal of in C2 infra of

**Beaconing**
: the process of an infected device phoning home to an attacker’s C2
infra to check for instructions or additional payloads, often
at regular intervals.
