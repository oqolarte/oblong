- Slight update on the CSS for the light theme.

How dare I dream of having a career in [writing](/writing) when I cannot
even do the thing consistently?

Check me on my down time; you will find me in my default mode, undoing
evolution by "lifestyle of sitting." Notice my posture, my taste in
which I swirl life's niceties, one palette at a time. I have become
bland, destroyer of words. Not the sublime kind.

Is a boring life a good life?

Probably. It means the important parts are stable enough that I can
explore new interests without the fear of failing
spectacularly bad that I would be forced into a squeeze.

Boredom is also a capable tool of unlocking new breadths and depths,
especially if one does not know where to look for inspiration.

But thinking about it makes weariness apparent. I look and feel older
now. Is it the hair? Is it the rate of recovery? Do I go there and think
Time has whittled the good instead of the unwanted bits away?

More clearly: thinking about time and money as finite resources in a
highly competitive [empire](/empire) accelerates the aging of those born
below the ruling class.
