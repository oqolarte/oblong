I have been thinking of doing more non-profit stuff just to feel
something new and exciting. Have you ever done that? If so, good for
you.

Just go out there---or be in here, that works, too---and help
however way I can to people in wherever midpoints they would like to
meet me; to support the causes they believe in, *we*
have a stake in.

That might be might sabbatical leave, if I even reach that point of no
longer just wondering.

The issue now, now that I have had a minute to pause and reflect and
overthink, is finding the courage. The mighty forces at work are good at
many things, one of which is giving us the illusion of comfort while
taking away some, if not many, of our freedoms: freedom to chill; to
just create (and maybe bl*ah*g about random things) and not worry about
getting by; to go out and wander into the unknown and unknowable to, of
course, make friends. To just be. And so I seek always for that courage
in the data I find in rabbit holes, in wisdom from friends who have
experienced more of the world than I am. But I am still here.
