Solarpunk started out as a movement in speculative fiction, [art](/art),
[fashion](/fashion), and [activism](/activism) that seeks to answer and
embody the question “what does a
[sustainable civilization](/social-ecology) look like, and how can we get there?”

It's a hopeful rendition of the future
in which [appropriate technology](https://www.appropedia.org/Appropriate_technology),
renewable energy,
and sustainable living practices
[empower us to build communities](/mutual-aid) that we want to live in.

Solarpunk, like cyberpunk, steampunk and other
-punk movements, deeply examines how [technology](/technology)
has affected our lives,
and how might we imagine it continue doing so,
but in a more optimistic way.

## Work in Solarpunk

Knowledge workers may have to re-train
to learn skills for manual trades
if we ever desire this solarpunk future.

Moreover, when you think about it,
we cannot import, outsource, and offshore all of our needs.

Growing our own food,
repairing our own stuff,
riding our [bikes](/bike)---these
physical activities would mostly likely be grounded
outside of the digital space where knowledge workers
mostly do their work.

Right now, it's hard to say what kinds of work would be obsolete in the
future, as it depends on the values and priorities of any society, as
well as the technological and economic realities of that time.

The simple table below is a prediction on
what kinds of work would and wouldn't be present
in this imagined future:

| Meaningful work                              | Meaningless work                    |
| ---------------                              | ----------------                    |
| Using renewable resource                     | Extracting non-renewable resources  |
| Preserving and enhancing natural environment | Constructing new infrastructure     |
| [Permaculture](/permaculture)                | Monoculture                         |
| Manufacturing life-long products             | Manufacturing single-use products   |
| [Repairing](/repair) / Upcycling stuff       | Designing products for obsolescence |


## Solarpunk in the Philippine archipelago

A solarpunk society in the Philippine archipelago
could potentially thrive
by leveraging the region's natural resources
and favorable climate to support the widespread adoption
of renewable energy sources such as
solar,
wind, and
hydroelectric power.

Our energy demand can be managed at the community level.
This might mean installing small-scale solar panels
and wind turbines on rooftops,
as well as developing microgrids.

## Is Solarpunk [absurd](/absurdism)?

It's understandable to be skeptical of a utopian vision of future.
After all, we know if it's too good to be true,
it likely is.

But such visions should inspire us to create and mold
better communities Now.
While it's impossible to achieve a perfect society
(which is subjective really),
living the [revolution](/revolution) in the present
will lead to a more equitable environment for future generations.

## Sample Projects

- [The Crack Garden](https://www.asla.org/2009awards/330.html)
  "reveal[s] the potential for beauty that underlies the concrete and
  asphalt that is the predominant ground plane material of the urban
  landscape [...] By eliminating portions of the existing concrete and
  exposing the soil beneath, potential is released, and new
  opportunities for the garden arise."
- [Ground Fridge](https://groundfridge.com/) "keeps fresh produce
  deliciously fresh without any electricity."
- [Solar-powered Website](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2023/06/rebuilding-a-solar-powered-website/)
  is an interesting proof-of-concept on how we might share information
  via internet that's solar-powered.
- Digging crescent-shaped holes can catch rainwater and reverse
  desertification by making the land hospitable.
