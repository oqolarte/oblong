I'd like to think that I'm taking it easy.
By having some personal projects that I enjoy doing, going through the motions of the day becomes mentally stimulating.
To be honest, I don't see myself monetizing a side project any time soon.
But, anytime soon, that could change because of some interjection of Randomness.

Maybe in these small pursuits I won't affect anything.
At least I can give *them* a headache by not merely doing what they think I'm supposed to do.
