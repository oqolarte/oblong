> What if in the near future, most of us are disabled? With a failing
> neoliberal healthcare system, all our bodies subject to increasingly
> carcinogenic and polluted environments, the rising cost of living
> coupled with stagnant wages, and state resources deployed to terrorize
> the poorest among us, it seems inevitable that disability and illness
> will become the reality for the vast majority of us. Yet most utopian
> futures rely on ableist beliefs that disability can be cured, and in
> doing so fail to consider accessibility as a central feature of a
> better world. The reality of widespread disability should compel us to
> reframe accessibility as more than ramps and elevators---it is a lens
> through which we can radically reimagine our world. Disability justice
> is central to creating a world wherein everyoneâ€™s needs are met.
> 
> Can we reimagine care beyond capitalist notions of profit and
> productivity? Can we dream of societies where no one needs to perform
> their disability in hopes of securing an ID for paltry benefits? Can we
> create communities where accessibility and inclusion are not solely the
> concern of the disabled? How can we reform our healthcare system and our
> social security policies to protect the most vulnerable among us? Paper
> Trail Projects is encouraging everyone to create Brave New Words that
> broaden the horizon of the accessible future and position it as a deeply
> political issue that concerns the vast majority of us.
