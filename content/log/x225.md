Ador, my Thinkpad X220, got its motherboard (mobo) fried a little over two
months ago.

In my research online, a Thinkpad X230 mobo could be a drop-in replacement.
I only needed to modify some bits in the chassis,
and the resulting "Frankenpad" should be better than X220.

I found [this guide](https://panacek.net/post/frankenpad_x225/) by a certain
Jiri Panacek during my first
round of research.
But at the time of writing this, it returns a 403 Forbidden error.

Luckily, someone archived it in the Wayback Machine.
You can visit the entirety of the guide [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20200124134623/https://panacek.net/post/frankenpad_x225/).

Below the line are sections copied from the guide for my case.
This will be my reference when I finally fix Ador with the X230 mobo I ordered.

ThinkPad X230 is a generation update which shares many components with the previous X220 model.
There are still some differences:
- new chicklet keyboard
- slightly different palmrest
- a mini DisplayPort instead of the full-size DisplayPort
- most importantly, Ivy Bridge chipset which outperforms its older brother, especially when it comes to the integrated graphics card.

## Pros:

- Ivy Bridge chipset with the official Windows 10 support
- Improved graphics performance
- Two USB 3.0 ports
- Support for two external LCD screens plus one internal (with Mini Dock Plus Series 3)
- Lenovo officially supports drivers for Windows 7, 8, 8.1 and 10

## Cons:

- X230 is not officially compatible with x220 batteries (you need to flash the embedded controller)
- You lose the CapsLock LED indicator on the keyboard
- COA Windows sticker does not match the OS
- TPFanControl does not show all sensors for the Ivy Bridge chipset
- A weird hole around the mini DisplayPort connector

## Process

1. Obtain X230 mobo.
2. Replace thermal paste under CPU heatsink (optional but recommended).
3. Take laptop apart and replace the motherboard. [Video (Youtube) reference](https://youtu.be/iJs01Q8EuDw).
4. [Modify the
   keyboard](https://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Install_Classic_Keyboard_on_xx30_Series_ThinkPads).
5. Put everything together.
6. [Flash the EC controller](https://github.com/hamishcoleman/thinkpad-ec).
7. Done!
