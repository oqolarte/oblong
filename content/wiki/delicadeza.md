*Delicadeza* means "being proper," or more specifically, to have more
refined behavior in accordance to one's own self-respect *and* standing
in the [community](/community). *Amor propio*, on the other hand, is
self-esteem and, dare I say, our [emotions](/emotions) having
[skin in the game](/skin-in-the-game).
It's no coincidence that many metaphors
include the face or [skin](/skin), like:

- *makapal ang mukha*, or thick-skinned face, usually to mean no
  delicadeza;
- *balat-sibuyas*, or onion-skinned, usually to mean very sensitive even
  against constructive criticism
