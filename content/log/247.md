## Brief review of *Ransomed by Love*

I suspect that this memoir of **Tony La Viña** was written mostly as
record for himself and for those people the author is grateful for
having met them. Nothing wrong with that, but the general reader like
myself might find it hard to relate if they didn't already know him. And
maybe that's the point closing in on itself---one must know him first to
buy and enjoy and get something out of the book.

La Viña also shows that politics and spiritual beliefs can and, at least
in his case, do work in tandem. It's because at the core of these
disciplines, politics and spirituality (or more specific to the author's
case, Christianity), lies *philosophy*, the love for thinking and
thinking about thinking, which La Viña took for his undergrad and post
grad studies.

I know and have personally met the author in the flesh. He's generally a
likeable person of booming voice and towering height. My partner and I
have always thought of him as a "super extrovert." It's no surprise
then that he is able to be so open about his life in this book, a thing
about his that I both admire and will criticize, as you will see below.

### More reflections on *Ransomed by Love*

*In which each paragraph can be considered a standalone thought. I transcribed and edited all of these ntoes from the
marginalia of our copy.*

**On friendship**:  
Starting a [friendship](/friendship) with someone leaves you both
permanently changed. It's like that saying, "One cannot cross the same
river twice." In modern culture, though, people have being canceling
their relationships as though it were subscription service to be toggled
off when no longer useful. While it's not necessarily wrong, I marvel at
how it gets easier to do that nowadays.

**On state and its violence**:  
We can't allow any state to have sole control over [violence](/violence). When we
fight for things like climate justice, of course we want the whole thing
going down as peaceful as possible. But the State would not hesitate to
get back at us, to force us in to a corner, and harm us for not wanting
the status quo they've propped up. When that happens, what then?

Is it possible to suffer in joy? The author seems to think so, and maybe
even [be militant about it](/joyful-militancy), but I haven't the wisdom
to get it and do that yet.

I like how the author, after talking about *kampanyang ahos*, the
Communist Party of the Philippines' (CPP) bloody purging of suspected deep
penetration agents (i.e., infiltrators, "government spies"), he casually
inserts the word "deception," perhaps implying that it has been core
mantra on which CPP has operated since its founding in 1968.

Instead of giving up solitude, why not find it, as a form of solidarity,
with people you love? Sometimes, my partner and I would
read our own books in silence as we are winding down for the night.

**On mining**:  
La Viña "believed" (as in past tense) that "mining, when done right"
could be sustainable, a version that I'm interested in knowing more of.
The way I see it, though, [we have everything we need right now](/refuse), and
won't be needing to mine for rare earth metals for many, many years. But
my vision would require [drastic life style changes](/simple-living) for a lot of us,
especially the elite class.

**On odd parenting**:  
"Revolutionary" songs are an odd choice for lullabying a newborn. And
also why was going home by midnight daily okay when the author's wife
had just given birth? At one point, La Viña, the frequently flying jet-setting
environmental activist lawyer, claims to be a hands-on father with his
children, while simultaneously admitting to not be the primary
caregiver, in less than a page. It's weird how domestic labor works, *no*?

According to La Viña, student leader [Lean Alejandro](https://bantayogngmgabayani.org/bayani/lean-alejandro/) would
have been "a senator or even a presidential candidate" if he were not
assassinated. But do we need him to be a politician? Who's to say that
aiming for a government position wouldn't corrupt him? In the wise words of the
anarchist thinker Malaginoo, I would suggest La Viña to "[Kill your heroes](https://crimethinc.com/2020/12/29/kill-your-heroes-a-filipino-anarchist-discussion-about-national-heroes)."

Can a set of "legal tools," most likely created and written by and for
colonial and national laws, be even of help in liberating indigenous
peoples (IP)? I also find it odd---*bizarre*, as in it reeks of
colonialism if there's no other context *bizarre*---that a certain
American Professor Owen Lynch once taught Philippine Indigenous Law to
the Filipino Tony La Viña.

The author hints that the Department of Environment and Natural
Resources (DENR) *has supported* businesses like oil and gas,
mining, and logging, all of which require needless destruction of
nature. But, I'm not surprised to hear this; DENR is known not
as a regulating body, but as a facilitator to accelerate the
putting up of such businesses that harm large swathes of natural
resources. Meanwhile, why were/are lawyers getting into environmental and energy
sectors?

Even with progressives like La Viña in DENR could not have stopped the
institution from issuing Environmental Clearance Certificates (ECCs) to
projects that ultimately disrupts the wilderness of sites, if any,
and/or displace the communities living there. I agree with La Viña that
ECCs must only be granted, if at all, after environmental and social
conditions have been addressed.

**On swimming in cesspool**:  
Then and now, government officials have a
knack for swimming in cesspools, literally. From the archive of The Economist,
"[The island that became too popular](https://web.archive.org/web/20230725122753/https://www.economist.com/asia/1997/07/17/the-island-that-became-too-popular),"
then Tourism Secretary Mina Gabor "went to Boracay [which had had its waters terribly polluted by local establishments] and took a swim" to assure tourists, who were already
canceling their bookings in the island, that the waters were clean. Over
to France last 2024, [Paris mayor swims in Seine as river is cleaned up just in time for Olympics](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/17/paris-mayor-anne-hidalgo-fulfils-olympic-promise-swim-in-the-seine-cleanup-pollution),"
not long after which [three German open water swimmers fall ill after Olympic races in the Seine River](https://apnews.com/article/2024-olympics-seine-river-illness-02d937f2d5f0fd20efafbf2250264aea)".
What I'm getting at is: if so-called leaders want to literally take a
bath in dirty waters, let them have it, but don't force the activity to
others!

Funny lines: Rolly Peña, a [revolutionary geologist](https://penarroyo.com/about-atty-pe%C3%B1arroyo/f/rolly-pe%C3%B1a-the-revolutionary-as-a-geologist),
was asked to join the DENR to work with La Viña, as he had "just
surfaced after a decade of working in the underground..." So, did he
emerge from the physical or political underground? Or was he the
resident geologist for CPP, and did he emerge from a CPP's base's
underground? So much unearthed material there that rocks.

**On Paris agreement**:  
In reality, the Paris agreement made no significant movement globally,
The [capital only heeds growth](/capitalism), and it demands more resources.

**On having international conferences regarding climate change**:  
My naive mind only brings me to this thought: what is the purpose of
this annual meeting of frequent flyers when they achieve basically
nothing? Perhaps they have not heard about [direct action](/direct-action),
and how its
effects starts from the ground up? Perhaps delegates are deluded into
thinking they can bring about change through all this talk? I *need* to
understand.

**On governments**:  
Throughout this memoir, the author says that the government can be
reformed. I'm roughly half his age, and even that's naive for me. States
will continue to work with capital, unless both of them are
[abolished](/abolition). For an archipelago as complex and diverse as
the so-called Philippines, it's arrogant to claim that a[ny] school of
government (such as that found in Ateneo, where the author has taught)
could hope to provide the framework for solving this nation's multitude
of problems. Plus, I see no wisdom in uniting the whole of
Philippines---or any nation for that matter. Of course, we can all live
in peace and harmony and not choose to be at war with one another; but
to be forced to like each other despite the obvious cultural differences
is a big ask. If we must "unite," it is with everyone else in the world,
and it's on the idea that we all deserve to be liberated. If we do care,
if we do internalize the bad effects of both Power and Greed, maybe we
would realize the need to escape them as a society. I imagine vibrant
[communities](/community) sharing practical lessons and resources with
others.

**On US-Iraq invasion**:  
I remember when our Grade 5 English teacher, Mrs. Rodriguez, asked us to
write a formal essay about any piece of news at the time. It must be in
the form of an editorial piece. I asked for my dad's help, and he did.
The output would essentially be his mouthpiece expressing his opinions
against US invading Iraq. I recall that our/his main argument was that
the US did it mainly for the oil. Mrs. Rodriguez wondered whether it was
actually me who wrote it. Physically, yes---the essay needed to be
handwritten.

Not surprised that a white male, [Bill Drayton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Drayton), appropriated a figure not from his own culture, because his sucks, but from one of slightly questionable origins. [Ashoka](https://www.ashoka.org/en-ph), named after [Emperor Ashoka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashoka), is an American-based nonprofit organization that promotes social entrepreneurship.

Good work is rarely a product of solitude but of solidarity and
cooperation. We cannot outrun [generational] problems unless we all work
together.

**On being a Swiftie**:  
La Viña and another scholar, [Nicole Curato](https://web.archive.org/web/20200828054153/https://twitter.com/NicoleCurato/status/1299220497675116545)
are both Swifties. I expected more from progressive people, but we have
them instead admiring a billionaire artist who, according to the video
analysis of the YouTube channel Wings of Pegasus, titled "[Taylor Swift's $2 Billion tour revenue... for miming?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8rMNMURShM)" she, Taylor
Swift, was miming (i.e., lip syncing) during her last world tour, raking
in insane amounts of dough in so doing. It's doubly weird for La Viña, a
self-proclaimed environmental activist, to admire Swift, one of the
greatest cabon emmissioners of the early 2020s, according to the article of Carbon Carbon Market Watch
[Taylor Swift and the top polluters department](https://carbonmarketwatch.org/2024/02/13/taylor-swift-and-the-top-polluters-department/)".

**On overworking**:  
Maybe La Viña didn't know yet the importance of resting, that backing
away from work means recuperating and not necessarily giving up. And
there's nothing wrong with giving up per se. To make lasting change, it
must be constant, which will only happen if we have the energy to
sustain it. Imagine working so hard you not only ignore your own health,
you *disrespect* it. Imagine working so hard that while hospitalized, in
Intensive Care Unit no less, battling cancer, you asked for your phone
and then conducted an online class! We need to realize that we can only
serve our communities and be a "happy changemaker" if we also care for
ourselves in similar intensity.
