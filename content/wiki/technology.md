Coming from an [engineering](/engineering) educational background,
I view technology as using what we know so far to help shape the spaces
we live in,
for example, to [create an ideal home](/dream-house).
On the other hand, it also makes it easy to avoid [human interaction](/communication).

{{< toc >}}

My reasons for learning different pieces of tech
trace back to my wanting to create something.
Tech isn't just a bunch of toys only meant for White Male Americans;
it's tools to create a more joyful world for all of us.

I'm interested in tech as tool that liberates me and/or
the spaces I occupy,
virtually or physically.

## Technology as solution

To have a solution, one must understand the problem.

A complex solution doesn't necessarily mean one fully understands the problem.
In fact, one could argue the complexity of solution is
[inversely proportional](https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/1999/11/a_plea_for_simplicit.html) to
the one's comprehension of the problem,
which is especially true in the context of [security](/security).
Not all things that could exist should exist!

BUT!
Not all problems are technical problems.
And not all technical problems are solved with [computers](/computer).
This is what tech bros must get in their heads.

QUESTION:
How then do we meet the challenges of
climate change,
biodiversity loss,
food insecurity,
and poor energy access?

### More questions to ask

1. How does one use a piece of technology? Alternatively, how does one
   go through a process of technology?
2. How does one maintain it?
3. Why must we use it?
4. When can we use something else?

## Technology in modern culture

Ursula K. Le Guin [rants](https://www.ursulakleguin.com/a-rant-about-technology) about how "technology" is "consistently misused
to mean only the enormously complex and specialised technologies of the
past few decades, supported by massive exploitation both of natural and
human resources." She poses a challenge:

> One way to illustrate that most technologies are, in fact, pretty
> “hi[gh],” is to ask yourself of any manmade object, Do I know how to make
> one?

Technology isn't necessarily applied sciences. Humans invented wheels
and build pyramids long before we have understood the physics behind
them.

## Analog vs Digital

Spending time in one makes me appreciate the benefits of using the
other. Being in both analog and digital world is a constant balancing
act in a society that forces us to adopt the latest technologies with
little to no regard to the marginalized.

If precision in measurement is critical, digital devices can output more
significant figures.

Assuming analog and digital measuring devices are well calibrated by a
trusted third party, analog devices must withstand faulty human
observation for it to be the better choice.
