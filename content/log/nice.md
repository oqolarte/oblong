- Added 11 new entries and four new one-liners to [Imbentori](/imbentori).
- Minor edit in [Bujo](/bujo).
- Added new project: [Notes on Market Research](/mr).
Currently, it serves as my personal reference, but hopefully it helps some of
you, too.
It's still in an ugly state, though, so it might not be useable for public.

## [Toe Clip Overlap](https://sheldonbrown.com/gloss_ta-o.html#toeclipoverlap)

> On many bicycles, especially those with smaller frames and full-sized wheels, it is possible for the front fender or tire to bump into the rider's toe or to the toe clip. Some people worry a lot about this, but it is rarely a significant problem in practice.
>
> The only time it can happen is when the handlebars are turned quite far to the side, as only happens at very low speeds.
>
> Many, many people ride bicycles with fairly severe overlap with no practical problems, sometimes having to make a slight adjustment to their pedaling habits at very slow speeds.
>
> On smaller-size bikes with full-sized wheels, it is usually impossible to eliminate overlap without causing adverse fit/handling issues. 

When this first happened to me when I got [FOLK](/afolk), I worried that it might
not be the right fit for me.
Good thing that it's a non-issue.

## "When one teaches, two learn."

At work, I explained some things to a newbie.
I managed to break it down for them without using too much jargons.
They said I made sense and were grateful for taking time to enlighten them on
specific processes they were having trouble with.

It's a nice feeling to help others in my own capacity, *no*?

## Calatagan, Batangas

Beach-less years are never the great ones, although that's just my opinion.
That's why it's a good thing that this month, I finally saw the sea, in person, again!
I got to swim on it, too, with new friends from work.
