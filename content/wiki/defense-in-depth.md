**Defense in depth** is a [security](/security) model that
makes use of a layered approach to [vulnerability management](/vulnerability-management)
that reduces risk.

The defense in depth concept can be used to [protect any asset](/asset-security).
It's mainly
used in [cybersecurity](/cybersecurity) to [protect information](/infosec) using a five layer design.

1. **Perimeter layer** includes some technologies like usernames and
   passwords. Mainly, this is a user authentication layer that filters
   external access. Its function is to only allow access to trusted
   partners to reach the next layer of defense.
2. **Network layer** is more closely aligned with authorization. It is
   made up of other technologies like [network firewalls](/firewall) and
   others.
3. **Endpoint layer**: Endpoints refer to the devices that have access
   on a [network](/network). They could be devices like a laptop,
   desktop, or a server. Some examples of technologies that protect
   these devices are anti-virus software.
4. **Application layer** includes all the interfaces that are used to
   interact with technology. At this layer, security measures are
   programmed as part of an application. One common example is
   multi-factor authentication. You may be familiar with having to enter
   both your password and a code sent by SMS. This is part of the
   application layer of defense.
5. **Data layer** is the layer in which critical data must be protected,
   like personally identifiable information. One security control that
   is important here in this final layer of defense is asset
   classification.
