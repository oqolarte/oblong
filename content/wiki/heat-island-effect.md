An urban heat island (UHI) occurs when a city experiences much warmer
temperatures than nearby rural areas. The difference in temperature
between urban and less-developed rural areas has to do with how well the
surfaces in each environment absorb and hold heat.

Nighttime temperatures in UHIs remain high. This is because buildings,
sidewalks, and parking lots block heat coming from the ground from
rising into the cold night sky. Because the heat is trapped on lower
levels, the temperature is warmer.
