- If you haven't seen it yet, there's a *very* minimal landing page for the TLD
  of this site, https://araw.xyz.
- Edited some parts in [Bujo](/bujo).
- Corrected a link from previous log. (h/t to Sahil).

I'm starting to forget that tropical countries have dry and wet seasons.

Now with the effects of climate change,
we either have dry and drier seasons;
or hot and hotter seasons,
depending on where you are.

The cool temperate days of early January that we predicted
to last until February have faded now.
In its place, a reminder of what it really feels like for the rest of the
year---sticky, humid, blinding.
*Don't you forget.*
