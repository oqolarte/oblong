- Added some lines in the [Old Computer Challenge](/old-computer).
- Renamed the (closed) project "Own Web Server" to "[Homebrew Server](/server)" for clarity.

Not much to report today.
Biked about 12 kilometers one way,
under the hot and humid tropical day of course,
to return the mountain bike,
the one I used on the way there,
to its rightful home.
Uphills are still a struggle.
The reward for getting to the peak is more road to travel.

*This is Day 6 of [Old Computer Challenge](/old-computer).*
