- Major write-up updates on [Site](/site) page.

Witnessing thyself through personal logs (journals, diaries, etc.)
with as much objectivity as possible is, well,
impossible, in my opinion. To do that, such logs need to be sterile and
factual. There is also the consideration of who you were, are, and will
be. People change. Our values change. What is considered factual now may
no longer be irrelevant in the future. Are you still going to *only* jot
down clean, academic- and journalistic-like retelling of your life?

It is hard to rule out emotions when one is compelled to document
certain life events. We feel feelings; that's just a matter of human
life.

Some might ask, "When one is sobered up, is an
objective log helpful in assessing what really happened?" If we factor
out emotions, is the shell of Logic and Reason an accurate data from
which to learn? Even most news outlets are laced with emotions-inducing
wordings.

We feel feelings at the end of the day, even people with
reduced affect display (maybe).
