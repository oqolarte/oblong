- Updated [FOSS](/foss)
- Updated [Refurbishing laptops](/refurbishing-laptops)

I traveled to south of Metro Manila to meet the donee of the laptop I
helped refurbished. He was grateful and all smiles. We do hope that the
computer helps in getting him a more stable life.

Then, while I was there, I met with three college friends who both live in
"the South." Good thing they were available for this spontaneous
catching up over dinner.

The next morning of the following day, I rode [my bike](/50) to
[Car-free Sundays at Marikina](https://web.archive.org/web/20250725055020/https://www.rappler.com/philippines/marikina-city-launches-car-free-sundays-pedestrians-bikers/)
to hang out with some new friends at [Make It Safer Movement](https://www.instagram.com/makeitsafermovement/) (MISMO).

Not bad for my philosopher[^philo] era.

[^philo]: Both a euphimism and a running joke to simply mean
"unemployed." People in between jobs supposedly have more time to think
about thinking about thinking...
