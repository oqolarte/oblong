## On not being in mainstream socmeds

It's a weird feeling how I'm missing out on interesting things
because I'm not on mainstream social media.

When something cool is announced in any of these platforms,
I would only hear of it when someone in my orbit shares this to me,
either in person or via online chat.

There are a few workarounds, though, to not miss out:
one of them,
[Nitter](https://nitter.net/about),
an alternative Twitter frond-end,
provides RSS feed.
I could subscribe to the RSS feed of tweets of some creator
so that I'd be updated.
And I am doing that right now!

In the Philippines, though, Facebook is more popular.
Hence, creators focus more of their efforts there.
What sucks for me is, as of this writing,
I don't know of any alternative
FB front-end that provides RSS.
When friends share a FB post to me,
most of the time, I'm redirected to the sign-up page
before I have even gotten a glimpse of what was it about.

### Do I go back?

I wonder if I go back to, say, FB,
would I be soaking in hate speech, disinformation, and noise?

I'd be lying if I say I don't think of it.
"What would I lose?" I would rationalize.

There has to be a sustainable way to filter all that, or
at the very least, wade through the mess
without losing one's mind or falling to a problematic mindset.
Could that be done by being mindful of the people and pages
that one decides to befriend and/or follow?
My friends and family are still in these platforms,
and to me, they seem okay,
so they must be doing something that's working for them.

## Weather

Recent weather is hot.
It is humid.
Then, it is rainy,
and the mud splatters on my back when I ride my bike on wet roads.

It's also getting hard to get good, quality sleep.
On the blue corner:
Raging mosquitos that are out to get us.
On the red corner:
It's the weather---stuffy, moist, and heavy.
Somehow, the latter is the lesser discomfort.
But both are not cool at all.

## Music

This May 2023, I have listened to an interesting mix of albums.

| Album Name        | Artist            |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Subconsciously    | Black Coffee      |
| The Best of Sade  | Sade              |
| Charango          | Morcheeba         |
| Come To My Garden | Minnie Riperton   |
| Post              | Bjork             |
| Untrue            | Burial            |
| 2012 -- 2017      | Against All Logic |

Notice how majority of them are electronic music albums.
And yet my favorite this month is the odd one, *The Best of Sade*.
I recognized some songs before I even heard their entirety,
because they have been sampled in other songs by other artists.
I had exclaimed several times, "So, this is where [ARTIST] sampled it from!"

More than any of that,
I like how complex the emotions that Sade evokes in each track,
as if I had gone through them in the past---I haven't for most---and
that I must live it again,
each time a more soulful iteration of the previous one.
