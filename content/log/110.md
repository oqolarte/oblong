Been staying in Negros Oriental for days now,
here to visit my partner's side of family and friends.

What, then, is comfort zone if not the spacetime beyond the
hypercube of home?
I'm here to experience another life,
admittedly as a tourist,
outside of Luzon.

The house we're in is filled with artworks of artists of varying esteem.
Now and then, I wonder:
how does it feel like to be both artist and art collector?
Too, I asked (whose answer I already know):
does one have to work for art?

After watching a [video by Van Neistat on art workers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMJ_kLLgXFM)(YouTube),
I was again inspired to create something, anything;
*be someone*.
At the same time,
I can't shake off the internal critic that knows any of my output will be crude.
In a society obsessing over details,
almost nobody welcomes with a warm smile a crude output.
And that's pinching me.

I don't want to romanticize nor glorify
art, work, and the intersection of the two as we know them today.
To be an art worker is a privilege and a burden.
The latter is important to note,
because I'd want to work with an artist who shares similar beliefs with me.
Not sure if I know someone in my circle that fits that consideration.
Also, am I ever ready to be a friend's laborer?
I hope so.
Ego gets in the way of meaning,
but if I ever hoped to make this work,
I shouldn't let it.

Realistically speaking,
this endeavor also means laying the foundations now for *the* artist in the future
to bloom without fear of devolving to obscurity.
As I said, I shouldn't let ego get in the way.
The future artist I'm talking about might be *me*,
a future version of myself liberated from today's ills.

This is my shiny new object.
It's timely, I'd say,
given my recent facination to physical handtools
and how they can help me make something, anything worth using,
looking at, and/or be around of.

Personal fears and life circumstances keep me
from creating with my own hands, though.
Because of these,
I question my ability to tap the inner artist.
But [there *is* an artist in me](/88).

At the same time,
my limited exposure to the art world clamps on my vision.
These days, I riff off of some creative's oeuvre,
not because my wits fail me.
Even [Austin Kleon encourages to not be original](https://austinkleon.com/steal/).

For this to work out in the long run,
I need focus.

Here's something relevant:
At work, I haven't been reading every email that gets in my inbox.
Many of them,
even with the rules and configurations I have placed,
are not even for me.
They're in my inbox because I was Cc'd at one point,
and not even I cared enough to let the sender know to "[p]lease remove me from
thread."
A keybinding will archive any not-for-me messages,
ultimately making it a non-issue for me.

Do I think this is the type of focus I want?
I'd say it's getting there.
I've invested time to set up a system that aims to say no on things that don't need my attention.
But more importantly,
I'm going to be actively [pruning](/105):
to cut away the excess noise,
to push back on even the great ideas;
all in an effort to work on something that I want to flourish [in].
