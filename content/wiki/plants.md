As someone lacking green thumb, I had given up on learning about plants.

## Native plants

Joy Santore introduces the concept of native plants in his post
[Why 'NATIVE' Plants?](https://www.crimepaysbutbotanydoesnt.com/blog/why-native-plants)":

I used to believe that all plants are good for the environment, and that
we should start planting them as quickly and as widely as possible. Of
course, there's a lot more nuance to that, including asking things like,
are the plants be native to the area? Otherwise, planting non-native
and/or invasive plants can do more harm than good.
