EDR is an application that monitors an endpoint for malicious activity.
EDR tools are installed on endpoints. Remember that an endpoint is any
device connected on a network. Examples include end-user devices, like
computers, phones, tablets, and more.

EDR tools monitor, record, and analyze endpoint system activity to
identify, alert, and respond to suspicious activity. Unlike
[IDS](/intrusion-detection-system) or
[IPS](/intrusion-prevention-system) tools, EDRs collect endpoint
activity data and perform behavioral analysis by using
[machine learning](/ml) and
[artificial intelligence](/ai) to identify threat
patterns happening on an endpoint.
