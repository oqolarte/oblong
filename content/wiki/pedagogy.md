My background in teaching has been informal,
limited to tutoring a family member and some former classmates.
I'm not good at it.
But, I am always curious and loves to explore things that fascinate me
in whatever way, if only I had the resources.
So, I try to [learn from the teachers on how they teach](/academy).

## Radical Education

Any attempt to teach should start with the experiences of the learners.
Find activities where they explore the socialization they've experienced
in life. For example, how beliefs, ideas, norms, experiences, etc.
shaped them. How their thinking, ideas, worldview developed over time.
What makes them think something is considered knowledge or theory and how
did they come to such understanding about knowledge or theory?

It might be good to start discussion that could help reset preconceived
notions of what learning in a school or university might be. Loosen some
of the hierarchy, rigidity, name some common frustrations with
schooling. From there, try to bring new spark in the space, in that each
person in the room has a stake on how the class will go.

### Reward-based?

When working with young kids, it might not be a good idea to give
points, rewards, stickers, stamps, or some other external reward.

The environment of learning should be made so that the kids are
intrinsically, not extrinsically, motivated. Allow them to experience
joy and pleasure, take pride, appreciate, etc.

The educator could affirm, appreciate, and validate the efforts they did
during the process, how they solved a problem, how they were creative,
etc.

## Are there even pros and cons?

By now, we have a clear understanding about what institutionalized
pedagogy can and cannot enable. Still, I think getting education through
this mainstream way (i.e., going to school) is a decent way to get
one's "foot on the door." At the very least, one, as a young person,
gets to mingle with other people of around the same age. This physical
interaction in the meatspace is always a good way to develop social
skills. And on *getting the foot on the door* I mean having enough
exposure to the current Babylon's infernal machines and meeting enough
of its silly metrics (e.g., having passing grades, getting a diploma,
etc.) to understand and play the game, and maybe help bring Babylon
down.

Of course, there are countless of people who have not stepped into, let
alone finish, formal education, and yet they are living decent lives. It
could be harder for them, though, because Babylon is not kind to people
who do not participate in its games.

## Learning/Teaching *both* Natural and Social Sciences

Our most pressing issues require competent people
who are both socially and environmentally conscious.

My experience in public schools' and state universities' curricula
didn't factor in the complexity of human behavior, in my opinion.
STEM (Science, [Technology](/technology), [Engineering](/engineering), [Math](/math)) education that I went through had
felt separated from real world examples.

Alberto Muyot, CEO of Save the Children Philippines, said on the role of
teachers in the AI era:

> I think that [AI](/ai) is really the way to go.
> And the role of the teacher will now have to be redefined....
> And that would be to promote [critical thinking](/being-critical).
> AI is a good tool (sic), but teachers should now look at the
> themselves not only as the repository of knowledge as it was before,
> but that they're the facilitator for critical thinking.

## Math Education

Consider the Math problem below.
Pause for a moment and see if you can get the answer.

> A boat has 26 sheep and 10 goats onboard.
> How old is the captain?

The *proper* answer is: "There's not enough information."

If you tried to manipulate the numbers of sheep and goats
and somehow justified it to produce the captain's age,
don't worry, you're not alone in this.

What the problem tries to unlock is our critical thinking skills in math class.
Just because the setting is in classroom doesn't mean all math problems in it
have solutions.

On his work, [*A Mathematician's Lament*](https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/devlin_03_08.html),
Paul Lockhart argues that math should be considered as a form of art
with practical uses in our daily life,
not just an exact science devoid of fun and enthusiasm.
Math as it is presented today in institutionalized education doesn't inspire
interest for students to pursue studying it.

In [Randy Palisoc's TED Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6yixyiJcos)
he argues that "Math isn't hard" when we think of it as a language.
When math is made more relatable and intuitive,
anyone can get the concepts.
