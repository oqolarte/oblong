- DNF [Olivia Laing's *The Lonely City*](/books/#did-not-finish)

## Reflections on *The Lonely City*

I have decided to not finish Olivia Laing's *The Lonely City* despite
the lovely prose. I do have some thoughts on some of the things
mentioned there.

Some nights ago, I plucked this dusty book from a dusty shelf.
Somewhere, I heard a lively discussion of a family as they prepared for
an important meeting the following morning. With the scene going on in
the background, I was drawn to this book of loneliness, but
unfortunately, not for long.

**On English language**: Can there even be "mutilations of English
language" when it itself is tapestry of severed parts from many other
languages? It's hard to mutilate what refuses to be whole. At least, we
can all agree that it's alive and mutating.

**On sameness**: Sameness of things is reliable, but it must be limited
to utilitarian purposes only. I don't want everything and everyone to
"be the same," because that's eventually reaches
[fascism](/fascism); but sometimes, I might need *the same* quality of
coffee that I drink every morning, but not all coffees need to be the
same! And when I'm tired of having the
exact same coffee, I want to be able to change
it, to modify it myself, to add latte art or a dash of cinnamon,
and make it mine: more
humane, more flawed, a bit loved.

**On troubled past**: My childhood trauma is far less intense than that
of [David Wojnarowicz](https://wojfound.org/), but the parts that remain fiery burn bright in a
faraway corner of the mind. I understand and have felt abused and
neglected, but the remaining brain cells in me have no way of processing
them the *proper* way. For example, unloading a non-trivial fist bump
onto a concrete wall doth produce an audible thump and a pulsating ache.
This is my practice of rage that I must do in secrecy, lest witnesses
find me weird for punching things instead of, evil enemies. At this
point, who dooms me deeper to past other than my being a nostal-junkie?

Like Wojnarowicz, I was once fascinated in my own myth-making. Who else
best to elevate myself into an enigma? But the endeavor, I would
discover, is tiring. I want to live! Outside myself, out there in the
real world. Soon, I settled with the fact that there are other stories
worth knowing, telling, and sharing.
