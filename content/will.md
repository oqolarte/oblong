*If* I die, I wish for the following:

1. Donate all my usable organs to medical and/or scientific causes.
2. Dispose my body to the sea. Wrap my body in preferably biodegradable
   material, attach some weights, and let it go to sink to the waters.
   This would be my final amendment with the sea, no longer burdened
   with fear of drowning. Let my epitaph be simple and hopefully witty
   still: "*Pa-deep*"
3. If the above is not feasible for some reason, dispose of my body with
   as little cost, as little carbon footprint, and as little effort as
   possible.
4. During my wake, play muzak. Sing songs of celebration and/or of
   mourning. If it's possible, you can even have an open mic event where
   people can play songs and/or read poetry.

## DNR

If I am no longer able to communicate with the world in a meaningful
way, that means I am either no longer alive or no longer wish to be.

If possible, I don't want my last moments be in a hospital, raking in
unwanted fees that might leave my loved ones to debt.
