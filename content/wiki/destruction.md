> The urge to destroy is a creative urge.

It's weird to have a dedicated page solely for the concept of
destruction. But it doesn't need to be about *just* bad things in life,
right.

## Outro

Destruction is ever present in the material world. Compared
with decay, which implies a slow, if not steady, breaking down of form,
destruction implies a more violent ending over a shorter period of time.
The latter seems to be a more interesting spectacle to
observe from a distance.

The worst kind of destruction is when it involves asymmetry of power
possessed by capital-S Someone having a big influence in dictating the
outcomes of many other people's lives. We see this in
[fascist](/fascism) states endangering marginalized people who are not
aligned with ruling party. Also, we know this from the bullies in our
local communities; and sadly, many of us have experienced this even from
our own families.

## In creating we destroy

Animals consume and produce only what they need. Humans, on the other
hand, produces excess, making us both the most creative and destructive
living creatures in this planet.

## Examples of destruction that fascinates me

(Any hyperlinks in quotes are added by me for convenience)

### Sabongeros and their fighting cocks

If I remember my history right, *sabong* or cockfighting, has been
practiced already long before
the Spaniards came in the archipelago.

People train their roosters for months in preparation for a fight. Even
the animal's diet is closely monitored. I
have personally met a few sabongeros who had even imported a "winning"
fighter from abroad to take advantage of its genes by breeding the next
generation of fighters.

Still, it amuses me that sabongeros willingly risk their *bunso*
("youngest one", a term of endearment often reserved for the youngest
kid in the family) to destruction for a chance at winning the fight, and
along with it, cash prize.

### Tibetan Buddhist monks and their sand mandalas

Tibetan Buddhist monks have this ritual of planning and
making the most beautiful, symmetrical, and geometrical designs using
colored sand grains known as mandalas, supposedly the representation of
the world in divine form.

After finishing the mandala, the monks would perform a few rituals, and
then they would destroy it. They sweep it up, mixing all the colors,
collecting them, and then washing them away. The whole thing is a
meditation on the impermanence of everything. Beautiful things don't
last, and neither is every thing else.

### Artists destroying their works

Many known and unknown artists destroy their works for various reasons.

One of the main reasons I consistently come across is somewhere along
the lines of, the work is no longer worth pursuing, and destroying it
frees the artist of the mental baggage, perhaps even allowing them to
start an even better work of art.

### Controlled burning of forests by Native Americans

Before European settlers colonized the Turtle Island, the Indigenous
Peoples of America was deliberately managing their forests through
controlled burning. Surface fires were used to control how many trees
there were growing in an area, which was critical in maintaining a
diverse ecosystem.

### Grief for the settler colonialists

In her book *Braiding Sweetgrass*, Robin Wall Kimmerer observes how it
is sad to think about the effects of death and destruction settler
colonialism has brought upon the Natives. But she also says that it is
*equally* sad for the settlers, for they will no longer experience the
beauty and abundance of the place which they have ravaged that Native
peoples had taken care for so long.
