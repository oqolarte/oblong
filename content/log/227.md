## Extreme minimalism

It's weird how rabbit holes lead me to different places, subjecting me
to short but well-received phases in my life. One recent one being
extreme minimalism.

Diving into the lives of those who practice extreme minimalism: I'm
always at awe how little the modern person actually needs in order to
live a meaningful life in this world, and yet comfort is a Pandora's
box that not only we can no longer close, the contents of which we are
still exploring and letting loose. I am sure that I won't be as
extreme as these practioners are, not that it's good nor bad. If
anything, they share important lessons in life, particularly about
[simple living](/simple-living).

## Falling teeth

Yet again, a recent dream quickly became a nightmare.

Upon checking my mouth, because what else is there to do in a dream but
to check one's mouth, I noticed that most of my teeth were loose and
wiggly.

Now, the mind is both brilliant and dim: based on historical data, past
dreams that involved falling teeth were, in the grand scheme of things,
nothing to worry about, i.e., I would wake up fine, relatively, mostly, anyway.
I thought of this *while in this dream*.

So, taking this as a an inevitable fact, I grabbed a small container and
onto it I spat my teeth. The rationale was, I would have my dentist fix
them and reattach them to my gums one by blessed one, and that stressing over the whole ordeal was not worth my mental distress.

As soon as I began spitting out, though, each tooth crumbled and
splintered into thousands of shards, mixed with blood and spit, all of
which irreperable by even the best of
dentists. I myself began to
break down, losing my wits to a failed plan that was never good to begin
with.
