**Empire** is "the name for the organized catastrophe in which we live today."

It's more than a collection of process, rather than a singular
mass/entity, that includes "the most brutal forms of domination to the
subtlest inculcation of anxiety and isolation."

Empire works hard to maintain itself by separating us from our
capacities, preventing us from fully realizing them. When it creates
shame and fear, it also makes the solutions, making us dependent on its
systems.

Empire reacts to modern rebellion by innovating new ways of *subjection*
(Dean Spade's more complex term for "oppression"):

- prisons as "evil containers"
- misogyny being eroticized
- opulence marketed as something we "deserve"
- etc.

### Subjection

We have [marketing](/mr) and advertising agencies to thank for selling
us commodified happiness in forms of priced experiences in which we must invest
before mentally/emotionally cashing them in. Empire uses this, along
with fear, to subject us.

Interestingly, Empire also manages to wiggle its way through
[simple living](/simple-living) and say that a simple life is enough for
one to be happy. What this does is put a cap  on the possibilities of
life, of experiencing a wider range of emotions, by saying, "You should
be happy you're here." If that sounds good to you, that's alright. But
I'm checking out.

### Rigid radicalism

Rigid radicalism, while not exactly the opposite of joyful militancy,
shapes our [activism](/activism) so that the spaces and relationships we
are in become toxic towards the people in it. It comes in many forms:
the need to be better than others; the way we self-censor lest we get
cancelled; etc.

Since rigid radicalism borrows ideals from the Empire and "requires"
them for revolution, it demands self-sacrifice, not for profit (that's
[capitalism](/capitalism)) but for the movement. I don't get the need
for self-sacrifice, though if making compromises offer better learning
experience. If there's no room for nuance and no space to wiggle, it's
not my revolution.

Not sticking to a monolithic ideology is liberating, mind you, but has
the drawback of being less certain on what actions to do or not do.
Which is fine---we are not wired to be cold and efficient. Our warm
bodies allow us to fail forward to a future where we're all freer.

Look no further: rigid ideology is what isolates CPP-NDF-NPA from the
masses they seek to liberate. The truth is, they have very little
affect.
