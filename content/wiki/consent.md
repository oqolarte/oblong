In the age of Getting Things Done at the [speed of Profit](/capitalism),
asking for consent is [revolutionary](/revolution).

This act asks you to be patient and understanding, instead of blitzing
through to achieve your own agenda with complete disregard to other people
involved.

Consent is not a one-time thing; it must be [cleary communicated](/communication) through all parties concerned whenever
necessary, because things change: people's capacities, environments in
which contexts come and go, culture, living situations, etc.

Waiting for the right time can also be a form of consent.

When relationships begin to crack and break down because of lack of
consent, we must pause and examine the dynamics that lead up to this
point, how we can sort these out to ensure all are equally powerful and
no one holds another over the other.
