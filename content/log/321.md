Despite knowing all the songs in this SB19 album, it was only recently
that listened to it from start to finish as the artists had intended. I
did that by playing a physical CD (remember those?) a good friend of
ours b(r)ought from Japan. Read more here: "[SB19 To Release First Physical CD In Japan](https://billboardphilippines.com/culture/lifestyle/sb19-to-release-first-physical-cd-in-japan/)"

I believe that the songs are "better" mixed in the CD than those in
popular online streaming platforms. It is just a gut feel, though.

**Rating**: 4 🍎 out of 5
