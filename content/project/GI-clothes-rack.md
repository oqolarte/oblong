{{< done >}}

I made a DIY clothes rack made up of galvanized iron (GI) pipes. All
threading. No welding needed.

## Materials

{{< figure src="/image/girack_10.jpg" alt="knolling of materials, including GI pipes and fittings, all on concrete flooring" caption="" >}}

All of the pipes and fittings are:
- GI
- Schedule 20
- ¾" diameter

That said, here are the materials:

1. pipes, each at 5', 3 lengths
2. 90° elbows, 2 pieces
3. 90° street elbow, 4 pieces
4. flanges, 4 pieces of
5. tee connectors, 2 pieces
6. 6" nipples, 4 pieces

## Tools

{{< figure src="/image/girack_05.jpg" alt="knolling of tools, including pipe wrench, two C clamps, threading oil, and die cast threader" caption="" >}}

1. Manual, Die, Ratcheting Pipe threader
2. Pipe wrench
3. Threading oil
4. C-clamps, two pieces
5. Wooden workbench (not pictured above, but will be below)
6. Any tray/basin to catch iron filings from threading
7. Scrap wood as spacers

## Prepping and threading the pipes

Skip this part if you can buy pipes at 5' lengths that *are threaded* on
both ends. This would be ideal as you wouldn't have to cut and thread
the pipes yourself.

In our local hardware, only 20'-length pipes are available. I bought one
length and commissioned one of the workers there to cut it for me for
extra fee.

At home, I threaded the cut pipes with this low-tech setup:

For video tutorial, See Jane Drill's tuorial "[How to Thread Pipe; A Beginner's Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32pzriZO1xc)" (YouTube) really helped.

This process needs all the tools, more notably the pipe threader, pipe
wrench, and threading oil.

## Assembly

Putting it together requires lots of screwing around. I found that if
some threads were hard to screw, applying WD-40 helped.

For a video guide, I highly recommend Gerardo's tutorial "[How to make Industrial Clothing Rack! || DIY for Vintage markets or Closet!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFgqlDB_Rac)" which is the main inspiration for this build!

### 1. Screw the flanges to the street elbows

{{< btt >}}

### 2. Screw the two nipples to each side of a tee connector

{{< figure src="/image/girack_12.jpg" alt="image of hand holding an assembly of tee connector with nipples on both sides" caption="Do this twice, one for each end of the rack." >}}

{{< btt >}}

### 3. Screw the "feet" (from step 1) to the tee assembly (from step 2)

{{< figure src="/image/girack_13.jpg" alt="image of assemblies of tee connector with nipples and flanges on both sides" caption="Do this twice, one for each end of the rack." >}}

{{< btt >}}

### 4. Screw the "feet assembly" (from step 3) to pipe

{{< figure src="/image/girack_14.jpg" alt="image of assemblies of the legs of the rack" caption="Do this twice, one for each stand of the rack." >}}

{{< btt >}}

### 5. Screw two elbows at each end of the third unused pipe

{{< btt >}}

### 6. Screw each leg assembly (from step 4) to each end of the rack assembly (from step 5)

{{< figure src="/image/girack_20.png" alt="image of a man screwing the leg assembly on to the rack part" caption="Person NOT me. Still taken from Gerardo's video tutorial. I forgot to take a photo of mine." >}}

{{< btt >}}

### 7. Done!

Don't forget to tighten the screws and check any misalignment.

## For improvement

This is my first, but hopefully not the last, building this. I learned a
lot.

1. Like I said, skipping the whole threading thing would have sped up
   the process, but that means scouring for already-threaded,
   cut-to-length GI pipes in larger hardware stores.
2. Pipe vise clamp would definitely help if I were to thread my own
   pipes again. Clamps and spacers do not hold well a pipe, especially when a
   torque is applied.

## Final thoughts

Estimated total cost: ~PHP 2,500 (~USD 45)  
Estimated number of workhours: 8  
Estimated value of satisfaction: *Priceless*
