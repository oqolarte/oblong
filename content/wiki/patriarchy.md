## From modern times

Joan Westenberg argues
[the patriarchy is a modern invention, not the natural order](https://web.archive.org/web/20240215185522/https://www.joanwestenberg.com/blog/the-patriarchy-is-a-modern-invention-not-the-natural-order/).

> For over 90% of human existence, during our hunter-gatherer phase,
> social structures tended to be egalitarian, with equal status and
> autonomy for women. The subordination of women only began with the
> development of agriculture, cities, and more stratified economic
> systems. Patriarchy today is the culmination of a long transition away

> lineage, inheritance, virginity, and monogamy. Understanding that
> patriarchy emerged so recently, under particular economic conditions

> laws.

## Unlearning patriarchy

As a cishet male raised (somewhat) on the progressive side of
Christian Catholicism, I feel like the vitriol of patriarchy is
ingrained within me. The first step in unlearning all of this is to
acknowledge its existence and its effects on my way of living.

In her essay "[am I missing out on male friendship?](https://jusdani.substack.com/p/am-i-missing-out-on-male-friendship)"
Dani has some suggestions on how men can have healthy relationships with
others:

> [T]ake some responsibility and [be] more ambitious in what wellness
> means to them. It is expanding their ideas of vulnerability and
> strength, and finding other ways of building connections with others
> that go beyond wicked alpha male ideas of embracing masculinity. It is
> learning from women how we treat each other without feeling entitled
> to the other.

The last bit resonates with me---I grew up holding the opposite sex to
certain pedestal that I was unable to form platonic yet meaningful
relationshipswith them.
