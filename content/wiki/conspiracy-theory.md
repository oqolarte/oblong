## On its "theorists"

Classic conspiracy theorists can "raise flags" and "ask questions"---not
particularly smart ones, although they can be made to sound like one,
just controversial and rage-baiting ones---and not make an effort to
find answers or peel the layers that might reveal something. Anyone can
ask outrageous questions, but it is important to also look at the one
asking:

- What is their social capital or status?
- What might be the reason why they are asking such an outrageous
  question?
- How large and significant (i.e., influential in the non-trivial sense)
  is the audience to which the question is asked?
- Is the person asking *really* hoping for answer, or are they just
  vying for any attention?

## False narratives

Countering a false narrative becomes messier when you are also telling
misinformation. Bad research, if research is done at all, can do more
harm than good, because it disguises as insight when it is just a
double-edged half-truth being swung recklessly by its wielder.
