Abstract:

In this article, I aim to talk about my personal experience using neat
tools in FOSS, how it affects my choices when obtaining a new piece of
technology, and how it might (or might not) affect the society at large,
especially if it is to be pitted against the "convenience" delivered by
Big Tech products and services, all within the context of where I live
in, the so-called Philippines.

Talking points?
- Free and open source software (FOSS), especially when I don't have a
  background in software engineer, is a niche of a niche in a developing
  country like the so-called Philippines. And that tiny space is not
  claustrophobic, I would say, because it is more of a rabbit hole
  leading to other interesting fields in and outside of tech, which I
  might not have stumbled into otherwise.
- In the so-called Philippines, if one could even afford a personal
  computer (PC), it is expected that Microsoft Windows is the operating
  system, unless they are rich enough to have Macbooks, in which case
  they have macOS. But with the wider accessibilty and more affordabilty
  of smartphones, many people are content with just these mobile devices
  for their computing needs. And who would not love having their own
  portable computers in their pockets?
- Sadly, smartphones, and most of the applications in them that can
  access the internet, have little to no incentive to respect the
  owner's privacy, defaulting to collecting as much personal data as it
  can send it to companies for further analysis. At one point in this
  country's electoral history, Cambridge Analytica helped elect Rodrigo
  Duterte, our Trump homebrew, but with more ties to the Chines
  Communist Party than Trump himself would have liked.

- Interestingly, both the proprietary software and hardware, especially
  in the realm of smartphones, are designed to be that shiny object that
  is increasingly hard to put down, easy to pick up.
- Many years into my FOSS journey, as niche as it is already, I have
  found my friends who share the same sentiments. Unsurprisngly, we
  share similar political leanings, which, let's just say, is mostly
  anti-establishment. Believe it or not, one's personal politics may
  contribute to how easy or hard it is to transition to using FOSS. As
  an anecdotal example, I heard that authoritarian leftists  in the
  country (whos politics I denounce, for the record) working underground
  use a mish-mash of Linux and FOSS apps to operate, while I have yet to
  hear the same thing from the State's military and police. In fact, the
  latter, from I what limited info I know, scour big social media apps
  like Facebook, because, to their credit, these platforms are treasure
  troves for personal and/or incriminating data. All anecdotes, of
  course.
- Deciding to use Linux as my main OS was a major turning point in my
  FOSS journey. And it was not done overnight. It took many months of
  research: what Linux distribution (or "distro") would be the best
  starting point for those switching from Windows; what hardware would
  be best for such distro; what apps to use; etc. From what I could
  glean from those who have been here before me, the Linux landscape is
  more forgiving now compared to ten or so years ago. That means even
  when operating from a framework different than the traditional ones
  with profit incentives, FOSS (and most likely free culture) can be
  fertile ground for innovation and development. The fruits of labors of
  all developers and designers *will* reach the masses, if they have not
  already, and everyone will be able to use them for their daily
  computing needs, no matter the complexity.
- Getting into FOSS has made me see that beneath the software, is a
  bunch of semiconductors and metal that does the computation.
- This has intensified my support for the our right to [repair](/repair)
  the devices we own. Software depends on the hardware, and maintaining
  the latter is just as important as that of the former. Repairing stuff
  is not a radical concept for me. Not because I have a degree in
  engineering, although that helped; but because the overall climate in
  which I have lived in. In developing countries, repair is just a way
  to extend an object's life; repair is not necessarily seen as a
  political act, just another service that someone might offer that's
  less expensive than buying a new object. Here, technicians for all
  kinds of tech are abundant, at least in major city centers; and so
  having one's broken stuff will not break bank.
- Still, when I read about how Big Tech overseas design their products
  with planned obsolescence, I wonder what kind of world do the top
  stakeholders of, say, Apple, imagine when they ship AirPods, which,
  according to [iFixit's Airpods Repair](https://www.ifixit.com/Device/AirPods) page, scores *zero* out
  of ten in terms of repairability.
- The wastefulness of Global North negatively impacts the overall
  quality of life for those in Global South. Yet, while the pressure
  should be applied more on the former, it is in all our best interest
  to keep things functional for as long as we can maintain it that way.
  The least we can do is to wear them down until they can longer be
  fixed. Not only that, it's also in the best interest of our
  environment, to not just throw away broken things without even trying
  to repair them. That way, we would not have to be digging up earth for
  precious metals or cutting down trees for wood, or pull crude oil for
  plastics, or you know, extract and exploit labor from the Global South
  for all the other things that make a tech product exist. Here I say
  "we" and "our" because of course it is a collective, global effort.
- STEM makes great strides forward. People continue to make better
  technologies to improve our quality of life. It affords us a degree of
  convenience. But there can be such thing as too much convenience.
  Having this, we risk losing our ability, our love even, for problem
  solving which we would leave to those who know how, lest we think
  critically. And thinking critically is inconvenient, no? We place too
  much value on convenience at the expence of other lives, even of our
  lives; we just do not know that yet. I know there are a lot of boring
  and menial work that we would rather outsource to the machines, but it
  is easier said than done. For example, recall the humanoid bots at the
  Tesla event last October 2024, after which TechCrunch reports: "[Tesla Optimus bots were controlled by humans during the ‘We, Robot’ event](https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/14/tesla-optimus-bots-were-controlled-by-humans-during-the-we-robot-event/)."
- Can we look beneath the UI or UX design and possibly determine the
  intention of its creators?
- How does FOSS stack up to these?
- Currently, I am *trying* to pivot into a career path that ensures
  privacy and security of people, with the hopes of
  one day giving back to my communities. The technological landscape of
  the future is too murky to be left alone to the surveillance of states
  and corporations.
- If Luddites smashed the looms as a protest against their working
  conditions, what does it mean to be a neo-Luddite? To me, it means
  using a wide range of tech---from the simpler Unix command line tools
  to the more complex self-hosted open source large language
  models---NOT to serve the already huge conglomerates whose state
  agents' boots are upon our necks. The proverbial smashing part might
  mean using FOSS and/or pirating corporations' proprietary tools to
  undo their machineries. In any case, I see Neo-Luddism as their
  planned obsolescence, the planned part executed through riotous
  collective bargaining, a two-prong approach of offense and defense
  that will render the ruling class no more. While smashing the
  proverbial looms is a cathartic option, an alternative for the
  neo-Luddites would be to instead repurpose them into something that
  may or may not have an inherent Productive Value.
