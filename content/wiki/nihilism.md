There's no end goal,
no demands to be met,
no programs to be followed---resistance thus being one of pure negation.
[We expect to go nowhere](/zemblanity)
while the duopoly of State and [Capitalism](/capitalism)
holds us by our necks.
Still, [we should fight back](/violence) as a sort of final defiance act
against authority---*Blessed Is The Flame*[^tal-blessed] is a good read on this.
It's more so focused on acting in the moment,
negating the delusion of a future [liberation](/revolution) that may never come,
holding that this sort of mentality prevents us from taking action now.

Looking for answer to poor questions like, "When will I die?" prevents
us from fully experiencing what's worth feeling in our remaining days.
To unlearn that there is a purpose liberates us from any expectations.

## Jouissance

(Or, more notes on *Blessed is the Flame*)

We are heading towards our demise, and I don't mean the natural kind of
expiring one day. I'm talking about that thing that we don't necessarily
want to come to us. To many, though, not proactively marching towards
our collective death is like chasing an oasis-mirage on the horizon.
Sytemic oppression can, has, and will design spaces that make resistance
impossible.

One of the most dehumanizing tool of oppressors to crush resistance is
starvation. If the body can't even function by not getting its basic
needs, there's no room for other thoughts and feelings, only hunger. For
us who are lucky, we may never know what it feels like to be
systemically deprived of food, but with the constant [collapse](/collapse), who
knows?

So long as the current orders exist, it wil co-opt and turn anything we
build against us. Anarcho-nihilism aims to destroy (figuratively?
Literally? Both.) all systems that contribute to the maintaining of
[Empire](/empire). This thinking believes that a new world is only
possible to grow from the ashes of the old, and not along and/or from
within it, a stark contrast to some radical beliefs that prefers to
obsolete the Empire.

Despite its gloomy connotations, the commitment to pure negation find
its most interesting manifestations in [joyful](/joyful-militancy),
creative, and limitless
project. *Jouissance* attempts to capture this feeling, but ultimately,
its only a placeholder for the enjoyment that rips through everything
bad and destructive in Empire. Nihilists embraces jouissance as the goal
itself.  Victory or defeat doesn't amount to much compared to the joy of
combating the ills of society in that precise moment. *Laban lang!*

One can only be in the eternal present at the face of danger. Past and
future will be foggy. Surviving now, when it's the only thing that
literally keeps one alive, will affect all decisions, and may become in
itself a liberatory practice.

Time becomes a fickle thing for nihilists. But it doesn't mean that it
is totally obliterated. More like, "how can we detach ourselves from
the dominant modes of time?"

Nihilists have as many ways to negate the status quo just as there are
many ways that Empire has in maintaining it. When progress is only
defined by the select few that accelerate it, let's ask, "why are you so
quick to send us to our demise? Why don't you care if we suffer?" Their
answer will be unsurprising and cold. But let's not wait for
it. Let's derail this train that's heading nowhere good fast.

Anarchists would likely never reach "critical mass"
and that waiting for mass consensus is to accept defeat. Despite this,
we have all the reason we need to envision and act on the lives we want
to live, with ourselves, [our loved ones](/friendship), and our [communities](/community).

Cruel optimism is a lifeline for desperate people and at the same time
prevents resistance. It becomes a false sense of hope that stops us from
acting on what would actually better our lives here and now.

Nihilism also challenges major ideas of anarchism that may be cruelly
optimistic: are we really be able to build new worlds from the shell of
the old? Evidence suggest that its just constant collapse.

Insurrectionary memory is a powerful tool to help us remind that the
dead *should* still haunt the living. To forget the past is to accept
grave mistakes can and will happen again.
