Queso's second album is a dense alloy of nu and reggae metal. That alone
should prepare the listener for what is coming for them. Great hits like
"Mottaka" and "Enes" have heavy hooks that pull in, and once you are in,
expect a violent thrashing first before you are again thrown to the
surface to breathe some familiar air.

**Rating**: 4 ðŸ§€ out of 5
