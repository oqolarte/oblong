Career-wise, I'm in a liminal space.
My last day on my work was yesterday, 11 Sep,
and I only have mixed feelings about it.

It's just a shame that I didn't get to send my own "Good Vibes" to the
rest of the company.

Admin [of my now ex-employer] started this "Good Vibes of the Day",
a newsletter that each employee would send out via email company-wide
everyday to share good vibes.
At the end of each email, the sender would then tag the next employee
to get the chain going.

After a while, it became a very long thread of unfunny work memes
that took a while to load because the email itself got large with all
the images in it.

One day, it just stopped.
I don't exactly know why.
If I did get the chance to send my own version of Good Vibes,
it would be super short and boring,
something like:

## Good Vibes of the Day

Good day, workmates!

Start your day with this song:
[PIZZICATO FIVE / スウィート・ソウル・レヴュー](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nv2wE1nu-E)

All the best,
