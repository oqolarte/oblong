I'm still on a break.
Like many people, this is the fine time to enjoy [the act of not-doing](/68/#on-time).
I both languish and lounge in limbo,
an almost limbless feeling
as we all loop daily through the lull.

And while I'm a slow reader,
I managed to finish at least one non-fiction book.

## Review of *Finding Orwell...*

So that one non-fiction book I just told you about is
*Finding Orwell in Burma* by an American journalist,
Emma Larkin, a pseudonym.

Larkin reports their experience during their travel in Burma---or
[if you're a bit confused](https://apnews.com/article/myanmar-burma-different-names-explained-8af64e33cf89c565b074eec9cbe22b72) like I was at the beginning of this
book, Myanmar---to trace the footsteps of George Orwell,
who had a non-trivial background in the country.

Whether people accept it,
the political is in our daily lives.
In Burma, so much so that their existence,
at least during the time of writing of the book (early 2000s),
had been a living terror of paranoia.
Last I checked,
situation hasn't really changed that much.

> "Real art is to be able to imagine something you haven't experienced."

I'm not (yet?) living under a totalitarian regime,
but this book reminded me that information, even when censored,
will always find its way to those who know how to look and listen,
bending even around a black hole if needed to escape its
total annihilation..
And if I may wonder out loud, Burmese people have been creating art
just by being or wanting to live,
which in itself subverts repression in the tiniest ways,
through creative ways: of passing time, of passing radical ideas.
This is not to romanticize the hardships of Burmese, or anyone
living under oppressive "government".

As for the prose, I find large chunks of the book stale.
But just each time I was about to give it up entirely,
the author would pull me back in with an interesting bit.
Now that I'm thinking about it,
could it be because that Larkin had the hard task of editing out
personal identifiable data, which made parts of the book
uninteresting for me?
