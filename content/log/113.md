## ... we didn't hear the news?

We went to family gathering last weekend up in cold Antipolo
during which we had all fun.
People prepared good food for everyone.
One family even brought good coffee to wash the sins away.
And I'm all for removing one sin with another caffeinated one.

Early morning yesterday, one of the attendees informed everyone
that they tested positive for COVID.
The news came as a mild shock, but shocking nonetheless.
If I needed another reminder that COVID is still around,
wait no more, look no further, feel worse.

We had to put off our plans for that day,
and that never feels great
if I'm being honest, especially when I'm already set to watch
the last gig of Banna Harbera.

## ... we made it to the last Banna gig?

I must've forgotten the feeling of disappointment
when a plan doesn't push through
until yesterday,
when we had to cancel going to the last Banna gig because of the COVID scare.

I'm not gonna lie, I'm still a bit down today because of missing this.

On the other hand, if we decided to show up knowing full well that we
had been exposed to at least one COVID-positive person,
it would mean we're reckless and selfish.

Anyway, [*I still dig you*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqUi8YV0_Yw).

## ... the film "Ngayon Kaya" were executed better?

I've wondered recently why
[Mayonnaise's song *Jopay*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX6pZryBKQY)
is rising again in popularity.
In a recent office party,
one of the hosts even quipped that
it's the National What-If song,
before the crowd went wild singing it, myself included.
At the time, I didn't get the reference;
none of the song's lyrics, in my opinion, are necessarily about
what-could-have-beens which, I would learn, is what the movie is about.

Fast forward to a week later,
a sibling told me that it likely came from the movie
*Ngayon Kaya (Maybe Today)* (2022), directed by Prime Cruz.

While the actors' performance don't dip below meh,
the script of tired what-if tropes
limit their potential to give more.

For me, the film could also be a critique on privileged people
risking, and ultimately ruining, other people's lives
for their selfish desires.
To be fair, the film acknowledges this near the end
through one of the characters.

Overall, I give the film a rating of **5.5**/10,
or "Watch only if curious about how this film would
play out, and never again."
