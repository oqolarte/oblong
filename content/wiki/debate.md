Be wary when getting into heated discussions with people.

## Meat in the middle

No matter which side you are on in a debate, especially online, the
other side will most certainly look for ways to dismiss you and your
beliefs. This is just the nature of debate.

What could be the ways to meet people in the middle? Or should we even
try if they themselves show no signs of listening from us?

## Is the point learning from each other?

Some people with extreme views, most of the time, want to prove themselves
and they will feel entitled for you to labor for them to come up with
something convincing for them. This will take much of your energy, and
realistically does little for all parties concerned.

[A huge part of learning is unlearning](/pedagogy). Nothing happens if
one isn't willing to unlearn, like how it is in accountability:
[people need to be willing to hold themselves accountable](/justice) in order to
change. In the same way, people should be willing to unlearn and interrogate
their own assumptions, standpoints, and positionalities and not feel entitled
for others to labor to convince them.

For my mental health, I try not to argue with strangers online.
