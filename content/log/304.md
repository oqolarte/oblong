I have been dreaming about classroom-related stuff recently, like:

- I was explaining to college batchmates how the political compass
  works; and
- I had a mouthful of chalk that I had trouble spitting out as it
  started to form a paste with my spit.

Perhaps this is my body's way of telling me to volunteer some brain cells to this South/South Movement call: [Palestine Solidarity Call for Volunteer Mentors, Editors, and Proofreaders](https://www.southsouthmovement.org/palestine-solidarity-helpdesk/).
This, instead of wandering across cities on a midnight
with nothing better to do other than wallow in sham.
