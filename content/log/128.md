My go-to answer when asked in a corporate setting what I like to do
is, "I like learning."
It's one of the safest answers that's still
true given the context, even outside work.
Really, I like learning things I like.
The rest will have to wait.

For example, I recently learned about myself that, at best,
I have mixed feelings going up the corporate ladder.
It's as if I'm being abstracted away from "what's on the ground."
And the spreadsheets---they are everywhere I look!
I don't like it at all.
Honestly, I'm [Sincerely Overwhelmed](https://youtu.be/Pfm_Yc1Vly0).

Still within the realm of honesty [and] about oneself: I tightrope now
between feeling *meh* about work and feeling the need to be recognized.
The latter is the weirder one to address, because I'm not one to seek
recognition for my work from colleagues. But the truth is, it hurts
no one if people nod my way from time to time. And they *do*! Some of my
workmates---bless their onshore hearts---have given me praises, and I
might've lost a few hours of sleep thinking about them.

This whole post, so far, looks like it's the result of me giving in to
my undiagnosed neurodivergent tendency to share seemingly inappropriate
things to people (read: you, readers), which could be an effect of
daydreaming.

One last example of this tendency:
I just watched *A Star Is Born* (2018) dir. by Bradley Cooper.
And I recall an online friend from the past telling me that this film
reminded them of me. Spoiler: Tragic ending.
