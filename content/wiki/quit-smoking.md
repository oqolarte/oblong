## Introducing: ekoms

Juvenile delinquency introduces many experimental things to our bodies,
and tobacco products is one of them. It's not your
fault for wanting to try things, especially if there's a social element
to it.

Moreover, the system is rigged to sustain
the infrastructure for tobacco industry. The sooner its consumers quit,
the better the world would be.

It still feels surreal that I'm able to quit smoking XX years into it.
I'm one of the lucky ones who have managed "to get out alive."

And since I had only been at it for XX years, I can't speak for those
who have been smoking for decades, some since they were in grade school.
How difficult it must be for them to break the cycle, to want to
actually breathe just air.

But ending the streak couldn't have been doable if there weren't
[friends](/friendship) and family who supported me in this effort.
That's part of the secret:
[surround thyself with loving and caring people](/community) who are
willing to help and [hold thee accountable](/transformative-justice).

## Don't be born to smoking parent/s

If, uh, you can help it, don't be born to at least one smoking parent.

If you remember your childhood to be anything but a breath of fresh air,
blame one or two of your parents for filling the atmosphere with toxic
cloud.

"[Children whose parents smoke are 4 times as likely to take up smoking themselves](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/children-whose-parents-smoke-are-four-times-as-likely-to-take-up-smoking-themselves)."

"[If Mom or Dad Is a Smoker, Their Teenager Is More Likely To Be a Smoker Too](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/news/if-mom-or-dad-smoker-their-teenager-more-likely-be-smoker-too)."


## What circumstances would it take to make me go back?

Before the slapping of nasty images of side effects from which people
suffer when they smoke too much too soon on packages, and even before
the advent of vaping, smoking cigarettes without a doubt had been one
way to look cool. For all I know, it might still be among the younger
crowd.

When you're young, looking and feeling cool is paramount in making it
among your peers, no matter how close you approach [annihilation](/destruction), because
in those moments---admit it---it's more annealing, really.

I have since removed myself from that crowd. I have realized that
inhaling not-just-air and getting addicted to it is one of the least
cool ways to exist. If coolness were a metric with which one shapes
one's life, try looking for it in other healthier hobbies.

But I have been there. I know what the addiction feels like. Even now,
I am still familiar with the pull of nicotine, and how back in the day
when I was still dependent on it, its absence only made the pull
stronger.

Up to a point, of course.

I have not tried it again, luckily. But it got me thinking: what, if
any, would make me go back to smoking? This is a thought exercise, no
more, no less.

- Losing more than one loved one in a span of three months
- My home and community are constantly getting leveled by bombs
- [Surviving the moment](/nihilism) is the only thing that matters
