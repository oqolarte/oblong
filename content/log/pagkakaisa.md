- Removed a few sentences in [This Site]({{< ref "/project/site.md" >}}), particularly those about my implied distaste towards JS.

After more than a year of not making an appearance in our ancestral house in Pagkakaisa Street, Isya and I finally went there yesterday.

To be honest, I was not too excited on going there for a number of things.
First, commuting via public transportation from Antipolo to Makati, even on a Sunday, is not easy.
Our travel time lasted around two hours, one way.

And lastly, people there, my relatives, are heavy chain-smokers.
Perhaps, the next time that we'll be there, we should wear (gas) masks indoors. 
The smokescreen from their constantly burning cigarettes was so thick I could not see past an arm's length.
I wish I was exagerrating.
Let's not even go to how long that toxic fume sticks on your person.
Hours!

But there we went, with or without incentives, because it's been more than a year since I saw them.
We have more catching up to do.
