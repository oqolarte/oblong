- Updated [Books](/books) list.

It took me a while to finish this sci-fi book by Ursula K. Le Guin, not because
it's a hard read. I was careful to read through it, like walking across
fields of Ice, even annotating the text to capture the dialogue and/or
conversation I had with the story. Below are some of my notes, which may
or may not contain spoilers.

- While Le Guin, as is her task as a sci-fi---really, *speculative
  fiction*---defamiliarizes the world with new environment and people,
  she grounds as with important questions regarding gender fluidity and
  how it affects social relations. Beyond predictions, this "report"
  aims to answer as many what-ifs as it can to reimagine what is
  possible in *this* world here and now.
- Something may factually be correct, but unless told with a compelling
  narrative, it runs the risk of not being received well, if at all. The
  inverse is also true.
- As someone who values privacy, I wonder what would happen
  if one of my closest friends became a famous celebrity.
- To become a full/[fool patriot](/fascism), one must love one's nation
  *and* fear others. Some would use the word *hate* instead of *fear*,
  but don't they stem from the same seed? Patriots tend to become
  fascists.
- Mad things we do for Love should not have to end in pain or harm or
  [violence](/violence), for then it is not Love, but a polystyrene,
  toxic version of it.
- Unlearning things that have had no good effects to anyone peel the
  folds of unwanted beliefs. This act reveals more of ourselves.
  Unlearning becomes learning.
- Why does someone from a supposed advanced civilization use Imperial
  System when Metric System is easier to understand elsewhere and thus
  far superior? Is it because the author is American, and Le Guin could
  not be bothered to switch systems? Or does the author think that in
  the future, space-traveling humans would all agree to use Imperial
  Units? Will these space-travelers be Americans?
- In a harsh reality with an even harsher climate, everything seems
  disagreeable. What would make the struggle worth it if not the
  [friends we meet and the families](/friendship) we choose along the way?
- The magic/miracle of [ansible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansible)
  is no magic, no miracle, for it relies on a very human thing:
  [communication](/communication). And since, not everyone is open to
  it, building better worlds will always be a challenge, no matter when
  we are.
- "To oppose something is to maintain it." A bold claim; I wonder why.
  Maybe opposing is not enough. Perhaps we need to obsolete the thing we
  oppose somehow if we want it to stop existing.
- It's okay to not trust all people. To those we distrust, are we fully
  closing all possibilities of meeting them halfway, of understanding
  the differences, of finding common ground?
- When something can neither be proved nor disproved, the chance to
  learn still lies between the spaces of people who have participated in
  the discussion. This is a good start at community building.
- Fear is an effective tool to sway people into dis/believeing
  something/someone. Will there be a time that we won't be needing it?
  Or is it really an essential yet exploitable human trait?
- When I feel out of place, it's hard to emotionally and mentally
  navigate the space (or void) between people. I'd rather be physically
  lost in a place with friends.
- It's often agreed that Time is an important non-renewable source among
  living things. And among those with a certain maturity,
  there is another: Kindness. Where, when, how, why to even source that?
- It's a blessing/curse to have no say where and when one gets born. But
  if it were possible to choose, would it be worth it? Will there be any
  reward to this Life of Lesser Risks?
- It's interesting to think about whether Taoism would exist elsewhere.
  Is the concept of Tao inevitable?
- [Revolution](/revolution) that outdates the Empire requires us to
  acknowledge that change has to be personal and political before it can
  ripple outwards.
