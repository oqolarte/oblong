As a generalist, I've always wanted to learn and make something. These
days, that *thing* skews abstract, but I hope to create more tangible
things using different tools ([hardware](/tools) and [software](/foss)
alike) that might be useful. For R&R, I like to read movies and watch
[books](/books) to switch things up

Sometimes, people say [good things](/testi) about me.
