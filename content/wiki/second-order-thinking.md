Consider the fence described by G. K. Chesterton:

> There exists in such a case a certain institution or law;
> let us say, for the sake of simplicity,
> a fence or gate erected across a road.
> The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says,
> “I don’t see the use of this; let us clear it away.”
> To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer:
> “If you don’t see the use of it,
> I certainly won’t let you clear it away.
> Go away and think.
> Then, when you can come back
> and tell me that you do see the use of it,
> I may allow you to destroy it."

If a fence exists, there's a reason for it.
Not necessarily a good or logical one,
but a reason nonetheless.

Before trying [to change existing systems](/revolution),
it's helpful to think about why it was put up in the first place.
Also ask what would be the consequence of the consequence
(second order, you might say)
of our actions, [attempts of intervention](/iatrogenics).
