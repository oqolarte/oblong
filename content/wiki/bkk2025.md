During the first few days of NOV 2025, we went to Bangkok, Thailand, and
it was my first time there. I want to write down some thoughts.

## Trains!

Bangkok is a relatively large place. I would say bigger than the whole
of Metro Manila.

Navigating and traveling across this huge expanse of flat lands is
easier through the network of city trains.

Mostly, the experience of riding the trains had been pleasant. Like a
lot of trains wheezing past through huge metropolis, they had ads
playing in the screens inside the cars.
I am normally [against advertising and marketing](/no-ads) in general,
but at the point, it felt like a sneak-peak at what the businesses
crave to extract from this highly consumerist place.
