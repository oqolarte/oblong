Hash value is a numeric value of fixed length that uniquely identifies
data. A hash value is the result of [hashing algorithm](/hash-functions).

A hash is not considered to be cryptographically secure if two files
have the same hash value or digest.

Security professionals usually use the hash values to gain insight into
a specific [malware](/malware) sample, a malicious or a suspicious file,
and as a way to uniquely identify and reference the malicious artifact.
