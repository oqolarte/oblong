Good data is expensive,
in that it requires lot of resources:
man power,
[computing power](/computer),
[hardware](/technology) and the logistics to make it available,
and the funds to make it all happen.
Under normal circumstances,
the average person won't pay out of pocket
to gather information, whether biased or not.

## Things to remember when presenting Data

1. **Garbage in, garbage out**. If collected data is garbage, so will be
   any charts, KPIs, or anything displayed using that data.
2. Data can tell you whatever you want it to, depending on the framing.
3. People need to care about the narrative around the data that's being
   presented. What are we measuring, how are we doing it, and/or is it
   even useful to do it this way?

As the viewer, do you take time to understand the data?
If you're going to use it to support an argument,
make sure what the data truly represents.
Consider whether you are going to make "evidence-based decisions"
as opposed to "data-driven decisions."
The latter is susceptible [McNamara fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McNamara_fallacy),
an exclusively quantitative decision making,
and is doomed to fail.

## Data in Machine Learning

In order for a machine learning model to be useful, it needs to work on
a dataset. It uses [statistics](/statistics) for it to appear
"intelligent."
