Joan Westenberg argues
[the patriarchy is a modern invention, not the natural order](https://joanwestenberg.com/blog/the-patriarchy-is-a-modern-invention-not-the-natural-order).

> For over 90% of human existence, during our hunter-gatherer phase,
> social structures tended to be egalitarian, with equal status and
> autonomy for women. The subordination of women only began with the
> development of agriculture, cities, and more stratified economic
> systems. Patriarchy today is the culmination of a long transition away
> from complementary gender roles toward the increasing commodification
> of women's reproductive capacity through paternal laws controlling
> lineage, inheritance, virginity, and monogamy. Understanding that
> patriarchy emerged so recently, under particular economic conditions
> rather than from biological fate, is empowering. It means we can
> rewrite modern society through consciously structuring culture and
> laws.
