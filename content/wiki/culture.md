## Ceremonies

Ceremonies are our way to "remember to remember" which can be important
if we want to remain in touch with our past and history. Some ceremonies
may have bloomed recently, brought about by developing
[technology](/technology).
Some are so obscure only a few people know about them.
But the more relevant ones involve entire [communities](/community).

Ceremonies have been important in keeping communities together and
accountable to each other. The [dominant society](/empire), though,
brainwashes people that ceremonies are impractical, a spectacle worth
relegating to [history](/human-history) at best. But ceremonies need not
come from [organized religions](/religion) or formal authorities.

In many Indigenous traditions, ceremonies celebrate non-human species
and the land to which we all belong. What if instead of focusing on
ourselves, our families, and our cultures, we do the same?
