My goodniss[^1] am I so scattered the past few days.
I know the source of this internal chaos;
in fact, we all know.

The little free time I have are spent lazing around with loved ones.
*And* deep diving recently to everyday-carry gears.

So much shiny new stuff to look up,
so little time and money to spend.
I dream of tools dreaming of me.
In reality, my dreams of them slowly crimps me from the outside in.

The bigger question is:
Do I even need them all?

And, of course, we know the answer to that:
I don't know when, but when that time comes,
it's certain that I don't have them in my person!
