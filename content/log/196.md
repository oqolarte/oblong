This is my annual complaint on how half of the year went by in a wink.
Today is also this country's supposed Independence Day. I dare not ask
its legitimacy with the unfolding of series of bad events; as long as I get to
rest from work, count me in.

## Main Character vibes?

Do you still feel like the main character of your own story?
Could it be that there are a few people in your life that don't deserve
the emotional labor that you're investing in them? Life is too short to
live alone, so we build [communities](/community), but we don't
relinquish living so that one abusive person can suck out the joy from
all his peers. We don't thrive when we enable (knowingly or otherwise)
any abusive tendencies. This reminds me of someone we know, a typical white
male American migrant, who's now operating in 95% fiction mode, i.e.,
lies. The remaining 5% of his energy, he uses in this reality to meet
his basic needs.

## Zesto Gang

I recently heard a modus operandi from many years ago from a group
dubbed Zesto Gang.

I'll let an article about [The Zesto Gang](https://balitangviral.com/top-10-modus-operandi-of-criminals-in-manila/3/) how it's done:

> A gang member would board the bus, usually looking like a bus
> conductor (with bills of cash folded lengthwise and wound around the
> fingers by denomination just like what a typical bus conductor does).
> He’d ask an unsuspecting passenger: “*Ilan?* (How many?)”. The
> passenger, thinking he’s the legitimate conductor, answers [with] how many
> people he or she would pay the fares of and hands over the payment. To
> the passenger’s surprise, the gang member gets juice packs from out of
> nowhere, swiftly pokes straw in them and hand them to the astounded
> passenger. Dare to protest and say “That’s not what I….”, the gang
> member simply interrupts and say: “Ah, it’s too late, I already
> punched the straw in.” And guess what, they jack up the price of the
> juice pack to as much as ten times the actual price.

I thought it's a witty and funny scam, but I surely would not want to
go though that myself.

## Corporate Zen?

LinkedIn is littered with professional folks wanting to perform a crazy
kind of motivational speech. It's both odd and unsurprising to see
corporate dweebs quote Buddha (or some ancient wise person), "I've
reached zen in what I do."

Which is baffling! How could one attain peace working in an environment
bereft of factors that would make it possible? If you're finding harmony
in working for profit, you're probably on the top 1% of the top 1%. And
in that case, there's something very wrong with you.
