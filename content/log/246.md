On the way to a Sunday-filled mall, we had an interesting conversation
with the Grab driver. He broke the ice by pointing out how the two front
wheels of a yellow 80s-or-90s Toyota Corolla dangerously wiggled, as if
they were going to pop off from the axle. I saw it too, worried a bit.

Our convo got to a point where the driver opened up being a rebel once,
as in part of the armed struggle the Communist Party of the Philippines
(CPP), New People's Army (NPA). But he left the group many years ago
when it became clear to him that his macho comrades didn't practice what they
preached, even citing anecdotes about how some of them were sexually
assaulting/abusing people with little to no repercussion.
Accountability, I inform the readers, is something that the CPP is
somewhat aware of, but brushes off. Maybe the entire authoritarian left
of the so-called Philippines (or simply CPP and its branches) is
allergic of accountability and justice.

We thanked the driver when he delivered us safely to the mall.
Inside, we all observed the horde of weekenders flanking the grounds with
us!
