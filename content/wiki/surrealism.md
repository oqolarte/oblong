Surrealism “[depicts] unnerving, illogical scenes […]
to allow the unconscious mind to express itself”,
to “resolve the previously contradictory conditions
of dream and reality into an absolute reality, a super-reality.”

Ron Sakolsky argues in their essay,
[*Surrealism is (Still) Elsewhere*](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/ron-sakolsky-surrealism-is-still-elsewhere), that
"surrealism cannot be reduced to a style or school of art,"
because it's philosophy bleeds into everything else,
much like how dreams and their extraordinary visuals and plots,
affect our waking lives.

[According to historian Abigal Susik](https://www.idler.co.uk/article/the-surrealists-war-on-work),
some French surrealists also "[waged a war on work](/anti-work)"
at the tail end of World War I,
when pay was too low,
hours were bad,
and there were no benefits.
These artists' practice was an embodiment of [revolution](/revolution).

Sakolsky relates surrealism to Bakunin's statement,
"The urge to destroy is a creative urge."
And we can observe this in many visual arts,
where depiction of reality is shattered to be replaced by an imagined,
more vibrant one.

Sakolsky adds:

> In engaging in such willful disobedience,
> it eschews the debilitating relations of mutual acquiescence
> by which we convince each other that our shared misery
> is the only possible reality,
> and reminds us that [mutual aid](/mutual-aid)
> can be an exhilarating collective adventure.
