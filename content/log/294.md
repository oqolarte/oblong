I discovered Rahim Redcar (fka Christine and the Queens) as one of the
collaborators in Charli XCX's song *New Shapes* (the other one being
Caroline Polachek). I liked his part in the song and figured I would
listen to one of his albums.

*Chaleur humaine* has relaxed me with its familiar house synths. But the
genderbending art-pop voice from the artist himself, I have found, have
more of this salving effect.

Bilingual/polyglot people adding their languages to their songwriting
adds more depth and breadth, not because it places a random foreign
phrase to evoke a certain *je ne sais quoi*, but because it culminates into a stream
of consciousness, much like a stream of clear water, that one is glad to
have found after an exhausting travel through the wild unknown.

I also appreciate Redcar's French speaking voice, especially in one of
the verse in *Tilted* and *Christine* (former is supposedly the English
version of the original latter, for the English-speaking audience).
