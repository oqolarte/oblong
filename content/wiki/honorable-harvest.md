Robin Wall Kimmerer, botanist and author of *Braiding Sweetgrass*, talks
about **Honorable Harvest**, non-strict guidelines from Native Americans
(which I suspect, other Indigenous Peoples of the world share some
version in their communities) about sustainable ways of taking from and
sharing back to the world around us. Kimmerer suggests that such
guidelines "might look something like this":

- "[Know the ways of the ones who take care of you, so that you may take care of them.](/mutual-aid)"
- “Introduce yourself. Be accountable as the one who comes asking for
  life.”
- "[Ask permission before taking. Abide by the answer.](/consent)"
- “Never take the first. Never take the last.”
- “Take only what you need.”
- “Never take more than half. Leave some for others.”
- “Harvest in a way that minimizes harm.”
- “Use it respectfully. Never waste what you have taken.”
- “Share.”
- “Give thanks for what you have been given.”
- “Give a gift, in reciprocity for what you have taken.”
- "[Sustain the ones who sustain you and the earth will last forever.](/eco-anarchism)"
