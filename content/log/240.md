## Brief review of *Purity*

This novel is the first work of Jonathan Franzen that I have read. Might
be the last, but I'm not one for closing on things permanently. Like
this book, since starting it, I have left it closed many times, for
many, many weeks in a row. It's that boring, honestly. And I'm not the
only one; people have the same thoughts on Goodreads.

It's a needlessly thick book about morality that could have
been nicely condensed to maybe *69%* of its original word count. I'm
chucking in the meme-ified number 69 to entertain myself, because that's
the only fun I could get from reading and reviewing the book. And it's a
nod to the author who has the habit, at least for this meaty text, of
inserting (!) sex stuff in the most literary way he could do it.

However, the author is trying too hard for my liking to be clever with
his prose instead of moving the plot along and/or letting the characters
tell their own stories through their [in]actions. Many times, it feels
like going through thick weeds in an already meandering forest.

If I'm being honest, the only reason I started reading this was because
on the synopsis, I caught the phrase "squatting with anarchists." But
the entire book has no anarchism in it whatsoever. It was just a plot
device, I guess, or a hook where there should not be any.

## Gray mornings

Recently, mornings have been cool enough to not warrant turning on the
electric fan for the entire night. Was this the case for December last
year?

Sometimes, light rain would wet the streets, preventing me from walking
the dog in the daytime. I tell Pablo, the dog, that we would walk later
in the afternoon, which is more doable now because of the weather. I
would also prefer walking him when there's still natural light outside,
than in the evenings when the white blinding headlights of cars could
maybe cost our legs or lives.

## Physical activity

Muay Thai, parkour, calisthenics---I'm wanting so many different
physical activities, those that require the least amount of equipment
and *maybe* zero gym membership (hard to achieve for learning martial
arts), but only somewhat able to sustain one at this point. How many
"sports" would be a realistic number to maintain in the long run?

I ask that, in spite of a recent mishap the cause/s of which is/are
still vague to me. I had to bandaged my right wrist for a few days
because of a minor pain that had something to do with a tendon or tissue
connecting my right thumb to my wrist. I'm fine now.

In a world of power imbalances, abusers tend to monopolize
[violence](/violence) to get what they want, even if they say that
it [has no place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3nSRcTkQsA) in [politics](/politics). A friend has shifted their
belief on the matter, favoring more and more to utilize violence as one
way to de-escalate. This is because of the obvious worsening of abusers.

Maybe, just maybe, being fit, strong, and able to punch up
could indeed stop abusers on their tracks.

Also, why do I get the feeling that this---meaning, shaping up---would
scale up well, from interpersonal to international relationships?
