While therapy is still pinned to a distant future, I'm writing about my
thoughts on the matter...

## It's hard

I have read that as we grow older, making friends tend to become harder.
I'm sure there are a lot of factors at play there, but I'd say it's true
for me. While I'm in a healthy, long-term romantic relationship, I still
want to meet new people and make new friends, and maybe rekindle old
ones. But like I said, it's personally difficult.

If I'm being honest, the most obvious reasons might be I'm awkward and
shy at first, on top of being introverted, but once I get past that
initial hurdle, I'm quite friendly.

I feel like... there's something else in me that I'm not seeing. Could
it be the aura I'm exhuding? Do I give negative vibes?

I've also considered the possibility that there might be an undiagnosed
mental problem that's affecting my social skills. Unfortunately, I'm not
yet in the position to confirm that through proper diagnosis.

I just started reading "Being Peace" by Thich Nhan Hanh, and within the
first chapter he said---which I may be oversimplifying here---to smile
and mean it and believe it. In effect, the world will be a little bit
better. Of course, there's a lot to unpack there, but is it a possible
step? Just smile more often and actually believe in it?

## Avoidant?

Looking back at some of my toxic behavior, I realized I may have an
avoidant attachment. Perhaps, subtleties in my behavior have been
pushing people away. This is something I need to work on.

Sometimes I am disinterested in others, but isn't that normal? One
doesn't have to like everybody, no? But it could be that this is the
vibe that many people are getting from me.

## Possible strategies

Now, on to ways that could help make new friends.

- **Find hobbies that allow for human connection**. Get involved with
  groups that like doing what you like doing AND are neither work nor
  home. Start by focusing on the activity.
- **Maybe not go to dating apps**. The probability of pain, bad
  interactions, and hits to self-confidence is a lot higher than the
  probability of positive outcomes. That game is rigged.
- **Volunteer to advocacies you resonate with**. While there certainly
  will be conflicts, each win hits at least two birds: better social
  connections made strong through collaboration; and the advancement of
  the collective goal.
