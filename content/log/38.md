In lieu of updating my Support page to include hardware,
I'd like to repost here what I posted in a [Freecycle](https://groups.freecycle.org/QuezonPH) forum.
This post will mirror those I submitted in the forum,
lightly edited and translated to English.

## IBM Thinkpad T40
Looking for IBM Thinkpad T40, accessories, parts, power adapter.
I actually have a T40 here, but when it was given to me,
some parts are not working properly.
I'm looking to refurbish it.

Specifically, I'm looking for these items/parts in good and working condition:
- keyboard
- battery
- power adapter
- RAM

If I successfully refurbished the laptop,
I will either donate it, or sell for a reasonable price.

## Apple Power Adapter

I'm looking for a working **Magsafe 1 L-type Power Adapter** for old A1181 Macbook model.
The Macbook itself needs refurbishing, but in
order to do that, I need a reliable power adapter.
If you have one lying around that's working,
I'm willing to discuss a method of transaction.
