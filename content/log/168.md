This week's updates.

## Reggae

This week, I listened to a reggae playlist when something in me was
triggered after hearing a snippet of it. The genre, when I first heard
of it, immediately made sense to me, like I was finally coming home from
a tiring journey and a loved one greeted me with a warm bowl of *sinigang*.
It's been long, but the cozy, warm feeling lingers, the one that can
only be felt in the tropics.

## Fire in the neighborhood

I have finally been in a relatively small street filled with firetrucks
from end to end. They came from nearby districts, firefighters aboard
and ready to fight fire, if only fire weren't out still by the time they
arrive. But the first few responders were quick to get to the scene that
the fire hadn't had the chance to grow to an unmanageable monster. Which
was a good thing! This neighborhood is so dense, that people will be
rightfully alarmed when they see a smoke from somewhere where there
shouldn't be.

*For example*, when a housemate burns dried leaves and twigs to "shoo away
mosquitoes," (a debunked myth, btw) neighbors *will* call the local village
council to check it. A plume of smoke---an irregular occurrence in this
part of the urban mess---coming out of an old house and lot
will always look like a real threat, never a drill to laugh at.

## Existential musing of the week

is brought to you by:

- an attempt by a random stranger to make my existing status unalive
via fake-crashing into the motorcycle taxi I was on; and
- the [plate] number... no, sorry, I didn't catch the plate number. I
  was busy thinking of my life.

My rider, like 99%
of motorcycle riders, thought it would save us time to counter-flow.
This random person, who probably woke up with a bad tooth, did not like
seeing two-wheels counter-flowing against their lane, which is
understandable. What escaped me is, why did they have to fake-swerve into 3
or 4 riders, including us? If this mad driver did clip us, I wonder
where I am now.

I had no control over all of this; I was just a passenger who kept calm
despite all the flares.

If this life is all there is, I told myself, I acknowledge its inherent
flaws and try to learn from them for as long as I can.
