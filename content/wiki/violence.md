The domain of violence goes beyond the physical.

Often, we are presented with a dichotomist view of violence vs
nonviolence: if nonviolence plays a key role in Gandhian style
principles and tactics, then the opposite must be true of a movement not
committed to nonviolence; and violence must be a central and highly
important quality of that movement.

But that isn't the case. In the US, the often described "violent"
counterpart to the civil rights movement as personified by MLK would be
something like the Black Panthers. Yes, they were committed to
self-defense and arming their community, but violence wasn't the central
or dominating principle of the Black Panthers. No part of community
education or breakfast programs is inherently dependent on being a
"violent" movement. Ultimately, labeling a movement as violent comes
with a lot of baggage while being too vague to actually mean anything
significant. But with the semantics discussion of particular labels
aside, there are two quotes that I feel reflect my thoughts on the
subject.

From Errico Malatesta, *Violence as a Social Factor*[^tal]:

> VIOLENCE, I.E., PHYSICAL FORCE used to another's hurt, which is the
> most brutal form the struggle between men can assume, is eminently
> corrupting. It tends, by its very nature, to suffocate the best
> sentiments of man, and to develop all the anti-social qualities:
> ferocity, hatred, revenge, the spirit of domination and tyranny,
> contempt of the weak, servility towards the strong. And this harmful
> tendency arises also when violence is used for a good end. The love of
> justice which impelled one to the struggle, amid all the good original
> intentions, is not sufficient guarantee against the depraving
> influence exerted by violence on the mind and actions of him who uses
> it. In the whirl of battle one too often loses sight of the goal for
> which one fights, and one only thinks of returning, a hundred-fold if
> possible, the blows received; and when at last victory crowns the
> efforts of the party who fought for justice and humanity it is already
> corrupt and incapable of realizing the program by which it was
> inspired.

And from Emma Goldman in a preface to *My Disillusionment in
Russia*[^tal2]:

> I know that in the past every great political and social change
> necessitated violence. America might still be under the British yoke
> but for the heroic colonists who dared to oppose British tyranny by
> force of arms. Black slavery might still be a legalized institution in
> the United States but for the militant spirit of the John Browns. I
> have never denied that violence is inevitable, nor do I gainsay it
> now. Yet it is one thing to employ violence in combat, as a means of
> defence. It is quite another thing to make a principle of terrorism,
> to institutionalize it, to assign it the most vital place in the
> social struggle. Such terrorism begets counter-revolution and in turn
> itself becomes counter-revolutionary.

Max Stirner also adds:

> The state's behavior is violence, and it calls it violence "law"; that
> of the individual, "crime."

Violence has some awful inherent qualities, and people generally don't
like when violent acts in and of themselves are fetishized.

But the following are also forms of violence:
- letting people starve while there is enough food for all;
- letting people die of preventable diseases, because they can't access
  health care;
- letting living things die in extreme weather, just so few people can
  profit from fossil fuels.

We can't condemn all violence, like self-defense, as objectively bad if
overall harm is reduced. As we fight for our rights, some people who
oppose are beliefs wouldn't always want to meet us with grace. Some of
them would resort to violence, in any of its form.

An essential part of a social [revolution](/revolution) will be the
building of dual power and [mutual aid](/mutual-aid) as a means of
resisting state and capitalism, and it wouldn't be effective to just get
a bunch of guns, declare the state overthrown, and then hope what comes
next works out.

However, when the oppressive entity you seek to undo is defined by its
maintenance of a monopoly on violence, it will inevitably take some part
in that struggle. Having said that, self-defense of the oppressed is
vital in surviving the attacks of the oppressor.

Violence shouldn't be the main driver of a revolution, but it will be
involved in some form, especially if it's one of the main tools the
state and capitalism.
