Thich Nhat Hahn writes, "Simple living [...] means to remain as free as possible from the destructive social and [economic machine](/capitalism), and to avoid stress, depression, high blood pressure, and other modern diseases... The only way out is to consume less. Once we are able to live simply and happily, we are better able to help others."

## What it is to me

A simple life, to me, means:

- Not falling trap to the [hedonic treadmill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill),
which means chasing happiness but remaining in the same state.
- Being content with an imperfect life.
- [Being more than my work](/anti-work).
- Spending quality time with friends, family, and [significant other/s](/non-monogamy).
- [Having a small house](/dream-house)
(between 40 to 70 square meters of total floor area)
that one, max of two, people can maintain easily.

## Some short- to mid-term strategies to consider

- Keep a journal using pen and paper to document life. [Bullet journal](/bujo) has worked well for me.
- When using the internet, [consider using RSS feed](https://aboutfeeds.com/) instead of getting
  info from [social media](/social-media) and other distracting sites, but---
- Read the news only at most once a week. If it's relevant enough, it
  will find it's way to you through the people around you.
- Gaming, especially video gaming, should be contained in its own
  [technology](/technology)/machine. I used to have a gaming-only PC.
- Put yourself in airplane mode and disconnect from the internet for a
  few hours each day.
- Try using [computer](/computer) the Unix way. Consider using TUI
  (terminal- or text-based user interface) for programs that are text
  heavy, e.g., text editors, email clients, RSS feed readers, etc. A
  great resource is [Terminal Trove](https://terminaltrove.com/)
- Ditch TV. Related to this, ava, in "[death to screens!](https://blog.avas.space/death-to-screens/)" post, talks
  about how they arrive to reducing the screens they use to one.
  Consider if that would also work for you.[^self]
- Detach from roles. You are more than your job, your achievements, or
  your schedule.

## On surviving vs living

Ideally, I don't want to be in a situation of extreme destitution. But
there's no way of knowing what would happen in the future. We might end
up where we didn't plan at all.

To be prepared for the worst but determined to not let it ruin the daily
life---this is a grounded hope that I want to have if I ever found
myself in survival mode. It's like packing emergency go-bags but making
room for the favorite blanket.

## On wealth

Wealth and comfort is relative. But glutton can be seen and judged by
how everything around it behaves, like observing a black hole as it
sucks in the light and distorts its environment.

## Concerns with simple living

I am actively choosing a simpler life, but the calls of my flesh simply
is against that. Perhaps this is because I have experienced certain
levels of comfort and pleasure that it is harder to step back on them.

This tugging of forces between mental and physical causes stress to me.
It is becoming a real problem, this cognitive dissonance that, I think,
the recent twitching on the muscle over my left cheekbone right below
the left eye might be one of its manifestations.

A simpler life, I suspect, could also be harder to attain for someone
who might be going through mental health problems. I, for one, am losing
focus. The capital-W Will is being depleted by forces outside me. And I
am always bored. These are issues I must wrestle with. Monk mode is not
a sedentary life, I assume.

Within the dominion of [empire](/empire), choosing to live like a monk
might not work out as well as one had hoped, unless one participates in
a community of like-minded people who also aspire of living simply, not
necessarily for aesthetics, but for its ethical leanings. A support
system is indeed needed. Actual monks have communities, too, and do not
live alone like hermits. I am too fatigued by my lonesome already to
want to be a hermit.

No matter the lifestyle we choose, I believe that inherent to human
nature is the need to be useful: at least to ourselves, to others,
and/or to the greater world around us. But what the empire is doing is
only allowing the lifestyle it deems useful to propagate its existence.
If we were to reap the benefits of a simple life, enough of us must be
in it, while also acknowledging the fact the choosing a simpler life is
only one way.
