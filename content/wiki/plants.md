As someone lacking green thumb, I had given up on learning about plants.
Until now.

## Why learn about plants?

One of the great tragedies of my life is not having the right
environment to learn more about plants.

We have lived in highly urbanized areas where plants could only grown in
pots and boxes, if at all, to be controlled and monitored and protected
from external harm. My parents were not into botany.

The closest thing to learning about plants was in highschool biology
class, which was sadly stripped of beauty and curiosity... only rote
memorization.

I still live in a highly urbanized area (as of writing this), but I have
become more open to the teachings of plants. For instance, I pay special
attention to those that [grow between the cracks in concrete and pavement](/revolution).

I also think that we have no choice but have our lives be intertwined
with plants---are they not one of the major reasons why we breathe
oxygen? I suppose in learning more about them, I move away from wanting
to building a fortress world in which everyone protects what they have
instead of [sharing it](/mutual-aid). In reality, we should be rewilding
our spaces to become a forest world, as environmental lawyer Tony La
ViÃ±a said in an interview, where we work with other plants and animals
so that all of us can thrive.

## Native plants

Joy Santore introduces the concept of native plants in his post
[Why 'NATIVE' Plants?](https://www.crimepaysbutbotanydoesnt.com/blog/why-native-plants)":

> A native plant is a plant that existed in a place before humans could
> transport plant species across the globe, mixing key elements of
> ecosystems that had been separated for milliions of years by oceans, the
> equator, and the polar zones.

I used to believe that all plants are good for the environment, and that
we should start planting them as quickly and as widely as possible. Of
course, there's a lot more nuance to that, including asking things like,
are the plants be native to the area? Otherwise, planting non-native
and/or invasive plants can do more harm than good.

## Plants talk?

Western science had argued for a long time that plants cannot
communicate with other plants because "they lack the mechanisms that
animals use to speak."

But plants are not animals; [communication](/communication) must be done
through mechanisms that plants use. Robin Wall Kimmerer, botanist and author of
*Braiding Sweetgrass*, writes (emphasis mine):
