In order to start building and making anything, start with something
relevant and/or useful. I found that this way, woodworking (something
that I'm trying to get into) would be more fun.

There are easier ways to make something, of course, like 3D printing.
But I've been swayed away from that technology because of all the
plastic needed and wasted to complete even the smallest of projects. 3D
printing, no doubt, is amazing, but when working on physical projects,
it's better in my opinion to start using hands for as long as they are
able to function, before even outsourcing it to a high-tech printer.

In woodworking, there's a possibility to reclaim and/or upcycle lumber.
When I made my own parallettes (pictured below), I used scrap woods for
the base instead of buying square wooden dowels: cutting and wood-gluing
the scraps to length to form a four-layer block per base. (The handle
was from a wooden handle for a shovel or ax that I bought new; I don't
have a lathe yet with which to
[woodturn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodturning).)

I'm interested in:
- learning how to treat or prepare old or scrap wood for reuse
- balancing the need to buy new wood and reusing scrap wood

Although inefficient, I found that not always relying on power tools is
a good practice for the manual labor with hands. Inefficiencies may not
be okay to deal with, but it teaches me something about convenience.
Discomfort is the starting point of losing one's mind, especially when
one has known or lived through comfort. Inefficient systems, as physics
have taught us, forces us to evaluate our relationship with what's being
wasted, with the by-product... with heat. And heat, more notably, that
which is amplified by the current climate crisis, is a clear contender
to be a leading mind scrambler.

ANYWAY, I'm not sure if the same can be said with 3D printing---can we "reclaim"
plastic waste, make it into a spool of filament, and use that to print
new projects? Even if that were possible, it might lead to horrible
consequences, like maybe top plastic polluters jumping in on the chance
to promote so-called recyclability of plastics specifically for 3D
printing works.

Working with hands, I am realizing, in a highly
digitalized world is like [experiencing joy](/joyful-militancy) in a
[slow and dehumanizing collapse](/collapse), which itself is akin to
experiencing melancholic lyrics in an upbeat tune. We do it all anyway;
we listen to it all anyway.
