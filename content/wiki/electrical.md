## Transformers (electrical)

The reason why transformers are rated in kVA (kilo-volt-ampere),
and not in kW (kilowatt) because the losses occurring in the
transformers are independent of the power factor. The loads that will
be connected to the transformer are never known to the manufacturer at
the time of transformer design. Hence, it cannot be rated in kW.

The temperature rise of a transformer is directly proportional to the
apparent power (kVA) which flows through it. This is also a principal
factor behind that the rating of the transformer is given in kVA and
not in kW.

## Difference of Grounding and Earthing

Earthing and grounding are two terms that are often used
interchangeably, but they have different meanings and purposes in
electrical engineering.

Earthing means connecting the non-current carrying parts of an
electrical equipment, such as the metal casing or enclosure, to the
earth. This is done to provide a safe path for the leakage or fault
currents to flow to the ground, and to prevent electric shocks to humans
or animals that may touch the equipment. Earthing also protects the
equipment from lightning strikes and provides a reference point for the
voltage levels in the system. The earth wire used for earthing is
usually green in color.

Grounding means connecting the current carrying parts of an electrical
equipment, such as the neutral or return wire, to the ground. This is
done to provide a return path for the currents that flow in the circuit,
and to balance the unbalanced loads in the system. Grounding also
eliminates the surge voltages and discharges the overvoltage to the
ground. The wire used for grounding is usually black in color.

The main difference between earthing and grounding is that earthing is
done to protect humans and animals from electric shocks, while grounding
is done to protect the electrical equipment from damage.
