You've likely come here from the [Support]({{< ref "/support.md" >}}) page.

I'm trying to get into the habit of doing projects so I stay sharp.
In the process, I'll try to document each step, and publish whatever findings I might have here for public viewing.

Like any other person, my interests oscillate wildly, so the ideas listed here can't be lumped into one big category.
The list is likely to grow or shrink 
(check this page every once in a while), 
depending on my current situation.
"Life happens," they say.
I tend to agree.

Anyway, here is the list, in no particular order:
1. News aggregator/portal 
1. Wifi router from household rejects
1. Water filter
1. Soap from used oil
1. Hand tools
1. Computer monitor from a broken laptop
1. Laundry detergent
1. Fixed-gear bike, preferably converted from an old roadie
1. Repair, refurbish, and/or repurposing of different consumer electronics
1. Free and open-source software *and* hardware, but not necessarily found together in a single device, that a layperson would find useful
1. Bio-digester

As soon as I start working on an idea here, it will be migrated to the [Projects]({{< ref "/project.md" >}}) page.
