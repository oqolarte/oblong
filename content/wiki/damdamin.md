## Concept of Damdamin

*Damdamin* constitutes the emotional imperatives of [Filipino values](/filipino-values). It's also related to intuition, whether
something is good or bad, just or unjust, without exactly knowing how or
why.

Jocano further argues that Filipinos are a rational lot, and we
imbue our rationalism with damdamin, and this makes us more sensitive in
our social relations. Our media is full of damdamin: folk songs, soap
operas, and movies being full of unrequited love, broken families,
unfaithfulness, and other misfortunes. (Many would rightly argue that
these types of media sell well, and they would be right. Jocano further
implies, though, that the reason why is because these also reflect that
inner hurt among common people. In seeing it manifested in an external
form do they feel vindicated or rejuvenated.)

But while easily moved to tears, we are also moved to laughter. We smile
and even crack a joke during bad times, even crises, as though smiling
and laughing were a great coping mechanism. And it is to a fault that
the state glorifies our being resilient. Resilience is a good Filipino
trait, but we cannot have a good life on resilience alone.

Three norms to follow so damdamin is not hurt and conflicts are
minimized, if not avoided.

- [*hiya*](/hiya) (politeness, embarassment, shame, humiliation
- [*delicadeza/amor propio*](/delicadeza) (refinement, proper behavior, self-esteem)
- [*awa*](/awa) (mercy, compassion, sympathy, pity)
