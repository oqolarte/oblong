When I was a kid, computers were like televisions with which I can
interact. Unlike televisions, what the screen monitor would show would
depend on what I type on the keyboard, and what I click with the mouse.
I can interact with the machine thanks to its [operating system](/OS).

## Laptops

Laptops are portable computers, with clamshell-like form factor.

The most reliable laptops on the market so far are:
- Lenovo, or the legendary IBM, Thinkpad
- Dell Latitude

## Smartphone

Meant to be taken with our person,
smartphones, and the apps in them, are designed
to be pocketable assistants.

### Ideal Phone

Inspired by [Thomasorus](https://thomasorus.com/my-ideal-phone.html),
below is a list of specs in my ideal phone.
I'm not sure though how likely these components would work together,
or what I'm asking would even be possible.

#### Hardware

- Physical keyboard like Blackberry phones
    - I personally use QWERTY layout,
      but it would be nice if the keyboard layout could be remapped
      programmatically.
- Small OLED screen, maybe within 2.5" to 3.5" range
- A camera for scanning QR and/or bar codes
- Anywhere between 8 - 16GB of internal memory
- Has a microSD slot for expanded storage
- Anywhere between 4 - 6GB RAM
- With 3.5mm headphone jack
- Removable Li-Ion battery, between 1500 - 2000 mAh
- USB-C port

#### Software

- [AOSP](https://www.androidauthority.com/aosp-explained-1093505/)
- Able to make calls and texts
- A media player, for audio and video
- Utility apps like: Calendar, Calculator, Notes, Dictionary, etc.
- Able to use E2EE [Signal protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_Protocol)

## Frugal Computing

Emissions from producing computing devices exceed that from operating them.
While new devices could be made more efficient,
producing them will make emissions problem worse.
Thus, it's still better to extend the life of these devices.
We must shift to mindset of achieving the same result for less energy.
