The phrase "joyful militancy" can't be distilled, in my opinion, into a
single definition, and is merely a placeholder for all the ideas it
attempts to encompass. This is good, unironically, because a word or
phrase cannot be made to contain complex topics; it can only be a giant
arrow to where we want our [communities](/community) to be.

Joy, in this context, isn't solely anchored to emotions, although
there's no denying that they both feed off of each other. It's more of a
process that increases our ability to affect and be affected in the
[most creative way](/art) at the face of uncertainty. Perhaps, joy is
the "good" dimension of Tao in [Taoist philosophy](https://terebess.hu/english/tao/gia.html): we can't fully
describe it, but its intensity, when experienced, transforms people,
places, beliefs, etc., into something more powerful that in turn
allows them to transform others more. It may be knowing that life is
full of suffering, yet we stop not strive for better one, even though
wanting it fucking hurts.

On the other hand, militancy is the willingness to fight: for love
unbounded; and for the [liberation of all from oppression](/revolution)
among other things.

Attaching joy and militancy together produces new ways of vigorously
affecting others, of being willing to fight for what we believe without
being cold, rigid, and ultimately, limiting.

Both optimism and pessimism could be used to navigate life's
uncertainties under Empire. It is in the balancing act of the two, when
mixed with the unpredictability of everything as time passes, that
some nugget of wisdom emerges; and the lives and [friendships](/friendship) from which it blooms are
annealed.

## What is Empire?

By the way, the book defines **Empire** as:

> the name for the organized catastrophe in which we live today.

It's more than a collection of process, rather than a singular
mass/entity, that includes "the most brutal forms of domination to the
subtlest inculcation of anxiety and isolation."

Empire works hard to maintain itself by separating us from our
capacities, preventing us from fully realizing them. When it creates
shame and fear, it also makes the solutions, making us dependent on its
systems.

Empire reacts to modern rebellion by innovating new ways of *subjection*
(Dean Spade's more complex term for "oppression"):

- prisons as "evil containers"
- misogyny being eroticized
- opulence marketed as something we "deserve"
- etc.

### Subjection

We have [marketing](/mr) and advertising agencies to thank for selling
us commodified happiness in forms of priced experiences in which we must invest
before mentally/emotionally cashing them in. Empire uses this, along
with fear, to subject us.

Interestingly, Empire also manages to wiggle its way through
[simple living](/simple-living) and say that a simple life is enough for
one to be happy. What this does is put a cap  on the possibilities of
life, of experiencing a wider range of emotions, by saying, "You should
be happy you're here." If that sounds good to you, that's alright. But
I'm checking out.

### Rigid radicalism

Rigid radicalism, while not exactly the opposite of joyful militancy,
shapes our [activism](/activism) so that the spaces and relationships we
are in become toxic towards the people in it. It comes in many forms:
the need to be better than others; the way we self-censor lest we get
cancelled; etc.

Since rigid radicalism borrows ideals from the Empire and "requires"
them for revolution, it demands self-sacrifice, not for profit (that's
[capitalism](/capitalism)) but for the movement. I don't get the need
for self-sacrifice, though if making compromises offer better learning
experience. If there's no room for nuance and no space to wiggle, it's
not my revolution.

Not sticking to a monolithic ideology is liberating, mind you, but has
the drawback of being less certain on what actions to do or not do.
Which is fine---we are not wired to be cold and efficient. Our warm
bodies allow us to fail forward to a future where we're all freer.

Look no further: rigid ideology is what isolates CPP-NDF-NPA from the
masses they seek to liberate. The truth is, they have very little
affect.

## Now, what?

Questions about how to be joyful in things we do have no single answer.
Rather, the answer, on stumbling on it, *fractalizes* into something
similar, opening new questions that may have deeper answers.

As with many actions, those who act and look for answers must be
committed to the cause, believing that it should affect all of us, not
just those whom they selected.

### Trust

The common understanding about trust is that it's all or nothing. Trust
can be a spectrum, depending on the situation, on the people involved,
and on the dynamics between these relationships. It requires courage for
it to start working. More so these days when so many vectors for harm
abound, people are finding it harder to trust. Yet when they do, part of
them knows the risks---a chance to do something bigger than its parts
even in the small human scale of friendships.

Trust can only scale up to community level, never to millions and
billions of people. We can never physically or virtually meet that many
people in our entire life, so it's only natural to not form any
connection with *every living human* that would be as strong as that
with one's community.
