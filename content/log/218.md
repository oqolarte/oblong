I claim that I have more important things going on in my personal life
that I cannot fully attend to because there is work flailing for
attention.

Loads are relative. Complaints bubble up, fester, and disappear all at
once to mix in with the air so gassy my mentholated inhaled could barely
help. In the end, we all become compliant.

I have decided to take a short (?) break from work---how short,
who knows[^work]---and attempt to focus on those that, per Kondo, "spark
[joy](/joyful-militancy)."

[^work]: It might actually depend on the economy.

## Music

For the month of Sep 2024, these are the albums I listened to.

| Album Name                      | Artist              |
|---------------------------------|---------------------|
| omw                             | Knowmadic           |
| Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge  | My Chemical Romance |
| ... Nothing Like The Sun        | Sting               |
| Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino | Arctic Monkeys      |

Just earlier this evening, I listened to *Tranquility Base* to accompany
me for a long walk home. And I missed that: not really feeling alone
and having the spirit of the city not messing with you, just being
there, noisy outside the comfort of muzak bubble.
