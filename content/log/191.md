Your body aches a few moments after waking up. Not all temples have the
sanctity to preserve itself all, or even most of, the time. Sometimes,
somewhere within, something upsets the body's balance for no apparent
reason other than just bad luck. It's a bad day: grey clouds loom; the
atmosphere leaves the marginalized in a daze; and you---hips, muscles,
spirit---are in discomfort.

Pain reminds you of the limited time here on earth, but try not to
overcomplicate the feeling. It would not evolve on its own. You feel for
the points where the fluorescence are brightest, and adjust the motion
of joints based on which gait is less blinding.

You find a rhythm. And with it you continue your day, and even finding
the time to walk the dog because all of you deserve to be out in the
night.
