Hearing more songs written and produced
by The Weeknd, I'm starting to think that he is mostly pulling from men's
sketchy behavior in relationships. The fuccboi archetype, particularly.
His songs are usually so sexual in nature, they are used in
smuts (*The Idol* and *50 Shades of Grey* come to mind).

In *After Hours*, The Weeknd provides a compelling observation on toxic
relationships and how it might not be easy for people involved to escape
each others' orbits without exerting significant effort.

The listener gets to listen to the rants, and of course, they are
melodious so that not only they are not annoying, they are infectious
despite the obvious drama lurking beneath the veneer of boppy tunes.
