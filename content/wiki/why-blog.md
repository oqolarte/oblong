## Preamble

Notice the title written as a question. Like many bloggers before me, I
too am trying to answer this for myself. But unlike many of them, I do
not necessarily offer a particular set of guidelines for others to
follow. As in, this body of text does not *really* offer a concrete
answer "why I blog," if you know what I mean.

## The future is confusing

Why document [a fraction of] one's life in the digital space in the
[internet](/internet)? Is not being vulnerable to strangers sketchy
enough on its own?

For me, what if it is partly to confuse digital archaeologists, partly
to leave a mark of who I am at this point in
[human history](/human-history)? When I was writing [Imbentori](/imbentori)
many years back, my duty was mostly to myself. A few people somehow
liked some of it. This meant that I had to embed the mundanities of the
life I was logging into cryptic and  ways of the English langauge before
publishing. I churned the literal into [surreal](/surrealism) because
exposing myself out there was something that bothered me, yet at the
same time, I felt the need to unload them somehow onto a space that was
outside me. So, I aimed to distract would-be readers, while also carving
out a space for myself.

Michael Stevens (of Vsauce fame)[^vsauce] touches upon this idea of leaving a
ghost of you[^MCR] on his video essay
"[All The Ghosts You Will Be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHd4zsIbXJ0)" (YouTube)
for the progeny. Stevens even talks optimistically about how our
excessive use of [social media](/social-media) is our way of getting
addicted to "what's next," comparing it to how humans have evolved to
feel good about exploring the unknown. Which is what gambling also
exploits, I guess?

[^vsauce]: I am neither fully endorsing the ideas behind the linked YouTube
video, nor am I a fan of his style of
presentation in general, but I add them here because I think he
succeeded in "engaging lengthy video essays" department; and traveling
on his through line is a trippy experience.

[^MCR]: I never said I'd lie in wait forever for a chance to
unabashedly make a My Chemical Romance reference. This is my odd way of
coping with the fact that I may never get to see them live next year
(APR 2026) when they perform at the Philippine Arena.

I broadcast some of my thoughts in the internet because I might also be
exploring---who I want myself to be, who else I could be, what things
resonate with me that others might find useful, etc...

The fog of time keeps things relatively interesting, especially for the
curious ones.

## Performance

If I am being honest with myself, the broadcasting part of blogging is
literally performative. The written text is *also* meant for other
people to read if they so choose. Call it asynchronous, asymmetric
electronic solution to satisfy the human need to connect with others,
albeit wrapped in many technological layers.

And if we distill what we humans have to say and slap it on gold-plated
copper phonograph record, and send it to space with the hope of it being
played (or "consumed") by an advance alien civilization, then we would
have blogged across interstellar space. Oh, wait, we already did with
the [Voyager Golden Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_Golden_Record).

Like many creatives in the industry, perfomance arts can be tricky both
to create and experience.

## The medium

HTML, CSS, JavaScript are useful tools with which to share information
across distances between computers. They can link pages that a blogger
might want to lead the reader next. The advent of tabs in web browsers
makes this a smooth experience. One can now open a page in a new tab,
and have it load in the background as one finishes reading the current
material.

This is great! We can now create mind maps with text using hyperlinks,
making connections between concepts and ideas. This might well be the
beginnings of Wikipedia and other wiki-related source of information out
there.

Now, cross-polinate the idea of wikis and blogs in the fertile space of
internet, and we have digital gardens---a personal[ized] knowledge
management that is maintained, published, and shared with others.
Because learning with others is a performance I like to do.

We have come to depend on algorithms to surface new piece of information
for us, but we did not always need them. Surfing the web alone was
enough, as long as one had the time and patience.

## Why not vlog?

If performance is a [tiny] fraction of sharing one's life online, then
why not vlog (video log)?

Videos do not scale as well as text does. It is exponentially more
expensive to stream a 30-second video clip than to publish the whole of
*The Brothers Karamazov* online, the latter being around 950 kB in
[Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28054).
