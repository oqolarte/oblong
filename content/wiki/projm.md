## Intro

Project management is the process of completing a set of goals
within constraints, usually time, budget, and quality.

Stakeholders are the people and entity directly affected by the project.
Including the project manager, vendors, contractors, consultants,
end clients, end users, etc.

Project manager is the one at the center, the gravity
(or glue, whichever works) that keeps everyone in tact.
They also (try to) maintain the project's conceptual integrity,
a state in which stakeholders both understands and agrees
with its goals, principles, direction, and priorities.

## Common Process Groups

1. Initiating
2. Planning -- is a stage in which the Universe will always conspire
   against everything that's been set up.
3. Executing
4. Monitoring and Controlling
5. Closing

## Problem solving

If simple and affordable solutions could work and its positive results
are obvious and can be felt, then it should be [communicated](/communication)
to the shareholders as simple as possible, but not any simpler. We can
worry about technicalities later on. For those who would want to know
more details, make sure that they are informed that such information can
be accessed (and sure that it *is* accessible!).
