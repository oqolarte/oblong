- Moved my only contact detail to the perennial footer.
Rearranged the details on the footer as well.
- Added 5 new entries and 1 new one-liner to [Imbentori](/imbentori).

Effects of regional language differences always interest me.
Recent example was from an online meeting at work.

My Filipino and Indian colleagues came to discussing our top three goals
for the year 2022.

"Naresh" (not their real name) from Hyderabad said the usual: more travel, better health, and *hike*.

The facilitator, wanting some small talk, asked (non-verbatim), "Oh, which mountains are you planning to hike on?
Are there mountains in India?"

Silence.

"Venky" (also not their real name) spoke in behalf of Naresh.
"Actually, Naresh meant salary increase when they said *hike*."

The facilitator, slightly embarassed, laughed it off.

[Sahil](https://blog.sahilister.in) confirmed on an email exchange that, yes,
"*hike* [is] usually short [for] 'salary hike' here in corporate India."
