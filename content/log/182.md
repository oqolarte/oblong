Last time that I went several cities south and saw my relatives there, they
were astonished when they found out that I got there on my bike. It's
about 28 kilometers one way---challenging, but doable if one is
physically and mentally prepared for it, which I was.

One of them scoffed at me, "Just because you can doesn't mean you
should." They're implying that cycling in major thoroughfares---even
with bike lanes---is hazardous in Metro Manila. All the more that I
should keep on cycling when and where I can, because doing so sends out
a message, and it is this: *We need better infrastructure for all types
of mobility that aren't motor or electric vehicles*. Pedestrians, of
course, suffer the most when their---*our*---welfare is sidelined to
just an afterthought in urban planning, largely implemented by those
that don't understand it fully.

It doesn't help that, as reported by PhilStar Global,
[MMDA mulls removing bicycle lane from EDSA](https://www.philstar.com/nation/2024/04/24/2350078/mmda-mulls-removing-bicycle-lane-edsa), because it's being "underutilized."
Plans like this, from a government agency no less, derail the inclusive
mobility that many groups have been pushing for years.

[Rappler also reports](https://www.rappler.com/nation/metro-manila/mmda-report-cyclists-edsa/):
"Only 1,500 cyclists on EDSA daily, says MMDA. Another bike count says itâ€™s more like 7,000."
This makes me wonder how MMDA gathers their [data](/data-management) and
the ways they ensure its integrity, before using it in implementing
projects.

I *will* continue to ride my bike when and where I can, as both the
messenger and *the* message.
And if something bad happens to me out there while riding despite:

- riding defensively;
- wearing helmet with a side mirror attached to it; and
- having head and tail lights; then

perhaps it's because the message demands more blood before it gets
properly noticed.
