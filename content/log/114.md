As the world transitions from one calendar year to the next last week,
it's always nice to remember the small wins that permeate
the daily life, that make the mundane slightly more interesting.

I have no interest in keeping up with a yearly resolution
when I know that it's not *the* point.
If I need to remind myself, though,
it's to not compare my timeline with others'!

## On Depending on Tech

When I go off-grid, the world won't know.
"Of course!" you'd exclaim.
Interestingly, in the age of social media,
people going off-grid share their experiences
if/when they go off-grid.
And that's not necessarily a bad thing!
For me, I'd like to learn from these [neo-Luddites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Luddism)
who try to reject the modern pulls of the systems in place.

Science and technology has helped us get here.
And it's worth examining the pros and cons of half-
or fully escaping our tech dependencies,
because *here* looks different depending on
the biases of who's checking.

All the physical and digital tools at our disposal
brought about by the advancement of tech
can be used correctly and usefully,
the latter having more meaningful results
while not necessarily efficient all the time.
But whose metric determines the correctness and usefulness
of a piece of tech?

I am snapped back to reality
when they announce today's sponsor...

## Beach House Music

When I heard the supposed anthem of Boracay,
[Ever After (EK Beach Mix) by Bonnie Bailey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfak_vD6K2k),
more than a decade ago,
my teen self felt nostalgic of a white sandy shore I've never visited
filled with equally white people I've never met.

This week, beach house muzak renewed something within,
because for me, it does evoke a summery feel,
even when the first week of January gave us nothing
but rains and cold breeze.

Below are some recommendations
you can look for in your favorite music streaming platform,
and let me know if you experience something beachy.

## On Life Lessons

We were recently sorting out the books in the house
into the following: for sending (to a loved one),
for donation, and for sale.

Naturally, books themselves distracted us
as unfamiliar titles resurface.
So, the task took longer than expected.

One particular book stood out to me,
because for years I've been searching for it;
and unknown to me,
I've been sharing the same space with it for a long while now.

The book is written by [Robert Fulghum](https://www.robertleefulghum.com/), called
*All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten:
Uncommon Thoughts on Common Things*.
It's a collection of short essays
containing some nuggets of wisdom I haven't read yet.

I'd like to think I can write something similar
when I reach 50 years old,
perhaps a more polished version of my [Imbentori](/imbentori)
but less neodadaistic.
