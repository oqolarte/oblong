Finally got to hang out with friends this weekend, and one of them
gifted a book to me, brushing off my insistence to pay for it. The book
is *Repair Revolution* by John Wackman and Elizabeth Knight, and while
this post isn't a full review of it as I've just started skimming the
first few pages, I read a line there that says something about how
convenience affects our want to repair.

I think more generally, when a form of convenience is introduced to a
system, it is gradually integrated, and people who may have benefitted
at least once from it will now take it into consideration in their
succeeding actions. It's not necessarily a bad thing, unless maybe the
loop evolves into a newer version that it becomes a bit less sustainable
because of the convenience component.

Real life examples:
1. Many people, especially if they can afford it, would prefer to own a
   car than a bike to get around. As policies continue to engineer our
   urban cities to be more car-centric, it would only make choosing
   riding a bike harder.
2. The accessibility of mainstream social media platforms like Facebook
   allows its users to connect with one another instantly wherever they
   are, as long as they're connected to the internet. Naturally due to
   network effect, people seem to expect everyone to have an account.
   Some workplaces even leverage this expectation so that they push all
   work-related communication---that is, without paying for other
   services like, Microsoft Teams---to, say, Facebook Messenger. I
   wonder if opting out of these services is a form of privilege, a way
   of regaining digital silence that only the elite can get.

I'm no futurist, so I'm not sure how communities would react as we
discover new ways of making our lives more convenient (at the expense of
*something*?), because my view of the future is limited to the radius of
my arm's length. Beyond that, the image breaks down to infinite
fractals. A few parts look happy and serene, but all of it is shrouded
in uncertainty. Just the other morning, who would've thought I
would wake up dizzy after sleeping longer than my usual number of hours?

I feel out of shape. Aside from the general uncertainties, I have a
non-medical hunch it's because of all the endocrine disruptors
we're releasing out there as convenience fee.
