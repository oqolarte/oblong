## Concept of Diwa

*Diwa* represents the spiritual core and serves as the teleological
component of the Filipino pamantayan system.

Life is without direction if there is no unity of mind, emotion, and
action. If these are united, our inner self will be at peace. It becomes
the diwa (or essence) of our intellectual, emotional, and spiritual
consciousness from which our life can blossom.

Diwa has an abstract aspect called *sigla* (enthusiasm, spirit, ardor,
vitality). If there's no vitality (i.e., sigla), life is meaningless.
But with joy, we can experience it better, even happier.

Diwa is often believed to be:
- spiritually preordained (usually by god/s and or nature);
- fate as grounded by human nature; and
- the main source of all comforts in life.

In many cultures, there's always something unseen or supernatural that
links people together. Some examples:
- [Red thread of fate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_thread_of_fate)
- [Ancient Greeks' idea of soulmates](https://www.thearchaeologist.org/blog/the-ancient-greek-myth-of-soulmates-how-we-became-human)
Jocano argues that for Filipinos, it's diwa: the vitality within each of
us guided by the cosmic forces around us that help us find our
communities. Diwa seems to be the bridge between destiny (supposedly
beyond our influence) and the freedom to shape it.

## *Bahala na*

Knowing this, many Filipinos invoke the concept of *bahala na* (loosely
in English, "let it be"), often viewed as any of the following:
- (negative view) fatalism or avoidance of responsibility;
- (negative) a total reliance on a supernatural god to provide or serve;
- (positive) the inner strength to take a risk, to take up a challenge

Furthermore, we say *bahala na* when we know the effects of our actions
are not obvious right away. *Bahala na* is the magic spell we use to
buff ourselves instead of waiting for empirical data because we must
decide right away.

When used positively as a way to delegate, as in "bahala ka na" ("I
leave it up to you") or "bahala na kayo ("It's up you, guys"), it
empowers people to have the confidence to decide for themselves.
