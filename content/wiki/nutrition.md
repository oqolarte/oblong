## Eat [more] dietary fiber

Fiber is a type of carbohydrate found in plant-based foods. Increased

  so that you'll be hungry less often.
- regulated blood sugar by staving off insulin resistance and slowing
  down the digestion and dietary carbohydrates.

Food to eat to increase fiber intake:

- whole grains
- nuts and seeds
