With *GOMBURZA* (2023), Director Pepe Diokno offers the viewers a
historical drama based on true events led to the martyrdom of the three
priests, Gomes, Burgos, and Zamora.

The film is decidedly dark---literally, with many evening scenes
seemingly lit only by candle flames; and figuratively, with how the
three priests were sentenced to death by garrote, a death no one should
have to go through ever.

As with many countries' histories, the one presented in the film is
death-filled, from prologue to epilogue. Colonizers do love their
massacres, and people in power have no qualms killing to instill fear to
control and subjugate their colonies.

Luck, too, seems to play a role in nation-shaping.
And I hesitate to use the term *-building* as I'm not sure
if we have ever gotten around that. More specifically, bad luck
has consistently hounded the Philippines, something the film attempts to
explore.

For a moment it got me thinking: if by bad luck I would die at this
moment, is there something nontrivial that I'm leaving as a gift to the
world? Maybe this blog?

Also worth noting is the actor Enchong Dee who, despite
his short screen time, gave a terrific performance. His character,
Father Gomes, was implicated by something he said that's taken out of
context that. Dee did deliver the range of emotions Gomes must have felt
throughout the whole ordeal.

Finally, two more things I have observed:

1. A nameless *indio* (i.e. native) is sometimes shown, not fully
   participating, but is there, listening and reacting to himself. Most
   of us, I think, will relate to this character in that, history will
   deem us unimportant because we won't have grand actions nor heroic
   deaths that might alter the trajectory of our future. But our stories
   will matter. When we finally decide to do something, it *will* have a
   bearing.
2. Ferdinand Marcos Jr., son of the late dictator, of the family
   desparate to revise their history, gives a speech about supporting
   local film industry before the film starts, an occurence in all MMFF
   entries. His presence is juxtaposed with the film being a historical
   drama that's thoroughly researched and fact checked by historians
   including Ambeth Ocampo and Xiao Chua.
