- Added a book in the [book list](/books).
- Added new entry to [EDP](/edp/#day-6).

Done reading bell hooks's book, *All About Love*. Like most non-fiction
I read, I took my time with it. All good things take time.

I am also slowly mulling on what things to do on my upcoming free time.
I told someone close to me that I might do/create things with my hands.
They suggested carpentry. I might just do that.
