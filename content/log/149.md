## Brief Review of *The Philippines Is Not a Small Country*

This is a book of essays by [Gideon Lasco](https://www.gideonlasco.com/), a medical anthropologist,
in which he discusses various issues and topics that are connected in
some way to the Philippine archipelago and its flora and fauna. Subjects
include:

- Country
- Nation
- Culture
- People
- Tech
- Modernity
- World

He writes concisely enough to deliver his main points, which I think he's
compelled to do, because most, if not all, of these articles had appeared on local
newspaper/s. The brevity is boon in that it easily captures the
willingness of the reader to participate in this discussion, but also a
bane in that the author could not explore the how's and why's of the
calls to action he imparts on nearly every write-up. So, when he
implores the reader, to me it feels cheesy, and in the end,
I'm not sure if I'm going to act on it.

Of the 90+ articles, I only really love about one-fifth of them.
And I don't mean that as an insult or anything negative.
Your experience may vary.

Final verdict: a good observation of Filipino lives everywhere.

## On text-heavy RSS feeds

I'm subscribed to about 200 sites---mix of digital gardens, wikis,
personal blogs, and everything in between---on my RSS feed reader, [newsboat](https://newsboat.org/).
Newsboat focuses on text which, for many who choose newsboat, is a
feature and not a bug. Text scales well, and is relatively snappy, no
matter how long a piece is. Since newsboat is extensible, there are
different hacks to view an image, ranging from simple to complex, but
I won't be discussing them here.

I'm interested in how RSS feed readers like newsboat bypass the site design
from which they pull their contents, and dump them on their own format.

Recently, I'm torn by this perk. I grew up in a "colorful"
internet of popping site designs and classy typography. By reading blogs in
command line, I'm stripping both the distraction and the allure of the
creative process that the authors may have incorporated in their posts.
Sometimes, this is good; sometimes, it gets boring, so much so that I
find myself opening the blog-post on the browser (newsboat allows this
with a press of a button) just to feel some colors in my corneas.

## On "logical" people

I wonder about these kinds of people who self-claim as logical.
When they pursue the purest forms of Logic and Reason, do they actually
approach it, or are they led further away from it by their own growing ego?
As an observer, I find it interesting to note the disconnect between
these "logical" people's words vs their actions; and yet, it's tricky to
navigate along the relationships they distort around them by
"following logic" when in reality, they're just suppressing their
emotions---not a good thing for anyone, especially arrogant men.

## On earthquakes

*Lumindol* last 5 Dec, and I only felt the last second of it, which
registered on my body as one of our cats bumping playfully on to my work
chair. When I looked down, there was no sign of cat. Only when I looked back up
to my computer did it dawn on me, thanks to the work chats flooding my MS
Teams, that it was an earthquake.

If I'm oblivious to such magnitude while many people became dizzy after
experiencing the whole ordeal, oblivion then might claim me in my sleep,
crushed beneath the rubble. This is not an exaggeration, because I do have a history of
sleeping through earthquakes, and my housemates at those times had had
to wake me up.
