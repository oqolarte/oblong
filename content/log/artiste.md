It's only until recently that I've realized this:

There *is* an artist in me.

For so long, I had dismissed any attempts at being visually creative.
The usual excuse: "I'm not talented enough to draw," or
"No one in the family is good at art," or
"I'm not really an artistic person."

But I *am* an artistic person --- at least in my own amateur, non-profit way.
I have always expressed myself through the literary arts[^imbentori].
A different medium, a different approach.

When it comes to visual arts,
my excuses only vexxed me in this toxic feedback loop of stagnating,
never creating, never expressing.
How did that go?

I recently saw [Keith Haring](https://haring.com)'s art for the first time a few
weeks ago.
And all of this hit me in a strange but good way.
It's likely because, in my humble opinion,
there's a bit of semblance or style between his drawings and [my
doodling](/ufnf/#on-doodling).
His art looks simple,
but we all know that there's more subtance to it.
