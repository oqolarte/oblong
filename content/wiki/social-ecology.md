Ecology wants to create anthropological continuity with nature,
harmony with where we live.
Social ecology, then, describes how individuals interact to the
environment around them,
including [how to express themselves](/solarpunk),
[how to deal with carbon footprint](/carbon-footprint),
or how to better use [technology](/technology), among other things,
and how these interactions affect the community they belong to.
