Iatrogenics is when a treatment causes
[more harm than benefit](/second-order-thinking).

Before intervening in a situation---be
it in personal [health](/health), [finance](/personal-finance), [technology](/technology), etc.---it's
best to know as much as possible.
This includes predicting what the outcomes of our actions and inactions,
whether each would indeed be helpful or not.

A good question to ask: "And then what?"

We should only intervene when the benefits outweigh the negatives.
