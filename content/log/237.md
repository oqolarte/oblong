- Added a new page, [Will](/will), inspired by recent events, and by a friend
  having their own dedicated page on their website. Of course, I will
  continue to update this until I'm no longer able to.

Before anything else, I think that all good things that have happened
to me are mostly because of luck; and many, if not all, of the bad
things are due to my skills, or lack thereof. I hope to change the
second part by more active participation in life.

## Actively doing the bare minimum

I just said that I would participate more.

It's because for many years now, my guiding workflow is the intersection
of [*wu wei*](/68/#on-time), procrastination, and [lethargy](/20). Not
that it's a good thing to stick to, nor is it a point that I desire to
escape from as soon as possible. I can't help but wonder whether this
trinity might be helping me preserve myself, so that I can continue
fighting for things that matter to me and my loved ones.

## Owning anything

So why bother working hard with the end goal of buying more stuff? If
one must work hard at all, it should be for the betterment of the place
and community one eventually finds themselves in.

We don't even own anything, really. It's true within
[Capitalism](/capitalism) in which nothing that we have (like house and
the stuff in it) or we do (like thejobs that gets us that paycheck)
belongs to us. Some rich people-in-power somewhere could bend the laws
and take it all away in one, or more realistically, several, swoops.
It's also true in the ecological sense in that, we are just temporary
caretakers of our possessions, and all of it will all go back to the
earth from which many of our stuff we have dug out of. What remains, I
think, it the [love](/love) we feel [for ourselves](/health) and [for each other](/friendship).

## Thinking of death

I witness my partner's family grieve for their matriarch, and I have
thought about my death, too. This lead to the creation of the Will page
on this site.

With all the commotion surrounding our final resting place, and how even
at death, capitalism still has stranglehold over our bodies, it makes me
consider to have a sea burial instead. As of writing, I'm not even sure
whether it's legal here in the archipelago, nor am I bothered yet to
even check this despite my proximity to the internet.
