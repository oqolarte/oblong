## Why

My significant other (SO) is closely related to a desaparecido (desap), someone
who is forcibly disappeared by the state. And since that fateful day, SO
and their family has been rightfully grieving.

People in what I would say chronic grieving tend to not prioritize
addressing their libidos. And that is understandable. As in the case of
SO, they are looking for their desap, which entails intense emotional
labor.
