### "PLOTS, NOT JUST PERSONALITIES"

*On senatorials*, by [Tony DG](https://www.facebook.com/easytalopram) (Facebook)

> The 2025 senatorial elections will not be remembered for ideologies or
> platforms. They will be remembered for arcs, mythologies, and
> comebacks. We did not elect governance. We elected narrative. The
> candidates who won were not the most qualified, the most experienced,
> or even the most visible. They were those whose stories the public
> still wanted to see unfold—whether out of curiosity, resentment, or
> sheer emotional investment.
> 
> There was no single wave. No clean ideological win. Just the
> accumulated weight of disillusionment crashing into spectacle. The
> Marcos administration, for all its programs, failed to offer a story
> that moved people. It promised order, growth, continuity—abstract
> nouns detached from lived reality. Rice prices rose. Public trust
> fell. The myth cracked. The narrative collapsed under the weight of
> its own self-importance. No policy paper can fix a story that no
> longer makes sense.
> 
> And the surveys missed it. Again. Obsessed with charts and confidence
> intervals, the polling industry treated voters like data points rather
> than audiences. It misread emotion as noise. It mistook silence for
> support. It failed to see that Sara Duterte’s quiet maneuvers mattered
> more than any headline. It ignored the weight of memory and
> underestimated the electorate’s instinct for drama. Pre-election
> forecasts did not see Aquino or Pangilinan returning. They did not
> expect fencesitters like Camille Villar or Imee to slip in. They
> especially did not account for Marcoleta—who climbed from irrelevance
> into the Magic 12 in the final act.
> 
> Because narratives win elections. Not platforms. Not experience. And
> not fame alone. A candidate needs a cohesive arc—unfinished, wounded,
> charged with stakes. People vote for characters they still want to
> watch. The story can be recycled, even ridiculous, like a soap opera
> twist done a hundred times. But if it pushes the plot forward, it
> sells. In this ecosystem, candidates without arcs die. Those with
> stories—no matter how bleak or bizarre—survive. Rodrigo Duterte’s
> arrest in March was billed as a climax, a historic correction. But
> climaxes don’t end stories here. They just reboot them. The old man in
> handcuffs became a cue. Sara Duterte stepped into the vacuum—not
> through speeches, but through moves. With an impeachment complaint
> hanging over her, she played queenmaker, not victim. It was her
> silence that made noise. Her support flipped the script in the final
> weeks. The entry of Imee Marcos and Camille Villar into the winners’
> circle was not a miracle. It was production.
> 
> Both Imee Marcos and Camille Villar, initially aligned with President
> Marcos Jr.’s coalition, distanced themselves amid the political rift
> and were later adopted as guest candidates by the Duterte-backed
> PDP-Laban. Their late-stage inclusion signaled a recalibration of
> alliances, with Sara Duterte leveraging her influence to bolster their
> campaigns. This strategic maneuvering underscored the fluidity of
> political affiliations and the enduring power of narrative in shaping
> electoral outcomes.
> 
> The impeachment threat gave Sara structure: the embattled daughter,
> standing between legacy and annihilation. She activated loyal
> networks, reawakened regional alliances, and funneled just enough
> power into the right names. She didn’t need to campaign. She only had
> to remind her bloc that their story wasn’t finished. The effect was
> enough to hold the Duterte base and reframe it—not as nostalgia, but
> resistance.
> 
> The moderates, for their part, returned not as saviors but as
> survivors. Bam Aquino and Kiko Pangilinan ran with restraint. They
> didn’t promise change. They carried memory. They won not because the
> public believed they could fix anything—but because people remembered
> when the floor wasn’t collapsing. Their campaign was not a crescendo.
> It was a reckoning.
> 
> Elsewhere, the pull of the familiar remained. Tulfo made it. Bitag
> didn’t. Bong Go stayed afloat. Bato, as always, hung on. These were
> brands more than platforms—names repeated until remembered, remembered
> until accepted. But name recall wasn’t enough. It had to carry
> narrative charge. Tulfo offered vigilante justice in Senate form. Go
> clung to the image of the loyal aide. Bato kept playing the caricature
> of brute force. These arcs, however thin, still had motion. And motion
> is everything.
> 
> Others faltered. Pacquiao, Revilla, Revillame—they lost not for lack
> of fame, but for lack of plot. Their scripts were exhausted. They
> weren’t evolving. They weren’t hated or feared. They were just dull.
> The electorate, fickle as it is, will tolerate corruption and cruelty.
> What it won’t tolerate is boredom.
> 
> And then there was Marcoleta. A man widely dismissed as the face of
> the ABS-CBN shutdown, now re-entering the chamber through sheer
> technical efficiency. He didn’t trend. He didn’t campaign visibly. But
> he moved. And just as his arc seemed over, the INC bloc endorsement
> resurrected it. This wasn’t sentiment—it was logistics. Machinery
> still matters, not as mass spectacle, but as back-end precision.
> Marcoleta didn’t win hearts. He activated infrastructure. The INC vote
> catapulted him from survey obscurity into the Magic 12, reminding
> everyone that even in a narrative-driven election, producers still
> exist behind the scenes.
> 
> Because that’s what this election was—a production. Carefully cast,
> unevenly scripted, poorly scored in parts, but undeniably consumed.
> The Senate is no longer a deliberative body. It’s an ensemble show. A
> rotating cast of legacy scions, antagonists, reluctant heroes, and
> walking plot devices. Policy is secondary. Presence is primary. What
> matters is whether your storyline still provokes something: rage,
> hope, fear, even disgust.
> 
> And the polling industry, still clinging to outdated models, will keep
> getting it wrong. It doesn’t know how to measure narrative momentum.
> It charts approval ratings like they’re immune to mood swings. It
> ignores the arc and focuses on the snapshot. But the electorate
> doesn’t vote in still frames. It votes like it’s flipping channels,
> scanning for a character it can live with for six more years.
> 
> Now, one day after the election, no one can claim absolute victory.
> The field is wide open. The center is hollow. The cast is unstable.
> The Marcos myth is broken. The Dutertes are regrouping. The moderates
> are reawakening. Every faction is now in rewrite mode. 2028 isn’t just
> another race. It’s the series finale.
> 
> Until then, we live with what we’ve elected: a Senate that reflects
> not the best of us, but the most familiar tropes. Because in this
> country, truth is negotiable, platforms are optional, and the only
> thing that truly wins is the fiction we’re willing to binge watch
> again and again.
