It's been two days now since my first jab of the AstraZenica vaccine[^sibs].
Side effects are almost gone now,
unlike on the first day when I suffered a splitting headache,
so much so that I had difficulty getting to deep sleep.
We're also told that we shouldn't drink coffee (or tea)
for two days---something to do with possible dehydration.
Not sure; I didn't hear the garbled speak of the doctor.

I jokingly suspect that caffeine withdrawal may have worsen the side effects.
That's my un-scientific take on it.
Don't quote me on that.
Tomorrow, I shall drink coffee again.

[^sibs]: Shoutout to my siblings and their respective partners for making this
  legally happen!
