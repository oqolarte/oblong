- Added new webring to footer. Finally got added to the [Pinoy Websites  Webring](https://webring.antaresph.dev/)!
- Updated [Books](/books) list to add two new items: *Crying in H Mart*
  and *Fahrenheit 451*
- Edited [CV](/cv).

Don't tell anyone, but I've been out for most days.
Two weeks later, I'm back with some life updates.

## Longtermism

I agree with a friend when they said:

> Longtermism devalues people who are alive today because of tyranny of
> large numbers. People who are into this idea are likely to build
> Omelas.

Omelas is a fictional place made up by writer Ursula K. Le Guin,
the story of which ("*The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas*") you can read
[here](/omelas.pdf) (pdf).
This "utopia" exists because of the misery of a child.

People have been saying that we live in strange times,
and it's always true Now.
More so that there are promoters of longtermism at the height of
development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).
Because I believe that AGI sits somewhat opposite of the values of longtermism,
but it could just be me.
And I'm not a fan of both, to say the least.

## On thinking of pursuing grad school

I'm at this point [again](/137/#thinking-about-career) when the glory of grad school is crushing me on
emotional waves.
Shouldn't I be skeptical of my own motivations and desires?
The more I think of it, the weirder it feels,
because the allure of grad school is "only" for high-performing students,
and I was never one.

I had applied in the past, all of which were rejected, perhaps to remind
me that there are indeed better use of my time.
Moreover, there's a special preparation needed to learn something
I might not need right away,
and I'm leaning that it might be my wasteful tendencies disagreeing on that.

Applied math seems like a good idea for post-grad study,
but it quickly becomes stale when I'm reminded that I didn't come
from a math degree.
Is liking math enough of an incentive?
One that I can think of right now:
I want to be good at math so I can write an elegant proof.
The last time I came close to doing this was back in high school
geometry.
It was probably basic, but I'm always grateful for our
geometry teacher. Thanks, Mrs. E_____o!
Because of her, I enjoyed writing proofs.

I guess the only thing that's doing the thing is doing the thing.
My progress so far is thinking of doing the thing,
which is not progress at all, i.e., not doing the thing.

I could also start reading math books.
But in order to learn, experts say that I need a teacher.
Maybe the internet would be a great one.

Related: can I teach math for a living?
I mean we do need better teachers who would treat math like art.
I'm not sure, though, if I'm going to be a good teacher.

When learning/teaching math,
according to Randy Palisoc,
take the language approach.
Not only is math an art, it's also language!
Even Galileo was quoted to have said so.

## Barangay Elections 2023

Candidates used the same old tactics during the short campaign period.
One of the nastiest was blasting "election jingles."
What they did was to moung a large speaker atop a vehicle,
and the vehicle would circuit the neighborhood throughout the day,
all the while blasting tacky songs with stolen melodies from latest pop tunes.
That's one song-blasting per candidate.
*All* of them had done this.

Never mind that there are people:
1. working from home (like me)
2. sleeping and/or resting during daytime
3. who have aversion to loud noises because of some physical and/or
   mental condition

Candidates running for office continue to disregard our well-being.

## Random thoughts

- Bad UX is bad security.
- Don't be afraid to be an idealist.
- "None" is considered plural.

## Music

For the month of Oct 2023, these are the albums I listened to.

| Album Name                                | Artist        |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Tracy Chapman                             | Tracy Chapman |
| KNOWER FOREVER                            | KNOWER        |
| A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships | The 1975      |
| Whack World                               | Tierra Whack  |

My favorite among the bunch would be Tracy Chapman's self-title album.
While understandably US-centric, it sounds very
[The personal is political.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_personal_is_political)"

Close second would be *KNOWER FOREVER* which showcases the serious
playfulness of the duo.
