## What it is?

When we embody the [revolution](/revolution) as daily practice, we are
also forging a clearer path for those who would like to join us towards
world*s* unlike this one.

A life worth living in, and not escaping from, can only be possible if
enough of us agree that it is possible now, and actually work on making
it happen.

French anthropologist [Pierre Clastres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Clastres) suggested that simple and more
innocent societies without rulers are more imaginative than their ruled
counterparts.
