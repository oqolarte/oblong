## Status: Done {.statusDone}

It may or may not have been obvious, but people around my age are fond of the internet. 

I had one which is still out there, on Tumblr, that you can still visit:

**[Imbentori](iooare.tumblr.com)**

It is/was my Tumblr blog the password of which I no longer remember.

A little while back, I even thought of parsing through the original text I have there, and publish them in some sort of a book...

I'm not throwing this idea permanently away.
It's just that I have more interesting things to tackle, in my opinion.

In the meantime, read the foreword I drafted some time ago for this would-be collection of personal essays.

## Foreword

The tongue that swirls with its perceived languages can only cope so much from the demands of diction.
*Imbentori*, then, is one own's tongue's attempt to speak the library of tensions as they never unfold in one's mind.
It is a list of personal truths told with cryptic lingo
(or with International Art English[^1], one could argue)
to add dimension to the mundane.
In some entries, there's no room for interpretation.
In any case, if you feel like the stream of thoughts challenge the way you read, *hmm*, then it's purpose didn't go off tangent.

"Which is what, exactly?" I hear you ask.

"Well," I mutter, racking my brain for *proper* wording.
"The intention of sharing this version of my Youth---captured between 2012 and 2018---is to offer a perspective of someone who both despises the world, yet remains hopeful of the people's capacity to kick-start a change, although they bore me at that."
And then you plop back on your chair, still unsatisfied with my ambiguous response.

You will notice quirks.
One of the most notable was how I refuse to capitalize letters that needed capitalization.
It's style;
you'll get over it.

### There's a free copy online

Most of them are lumped into what I call [Unscholarly Notes](https://iooare.tumblr.com/tagged/unscholarly-notes),
after a chapter in one of my favorite books by F. Sionil Jose.

[^1]: Reminds me of a paper called [_"Bullshit Makes The Art Grow Profounder"_](http://journal.sjdm.org/19/190712/jdm190712.html) (Turpin et. al., 2019). 
Some 20(20) years ago when I last visited an art museum (or was it just gallery?), I couldn't help but roll my eyes on a lot of pieces' description cards that seemingly always include how the artist "explores" this or that.
