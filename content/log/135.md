## Review of *Klara and the sun*

I have recently finished reading *Klara and the sun* by Kazuo Ishiguro.
Below is a brief no-spoilers review of the sci-fi novel.

I like how Ishiguro explores the possibility of a more human(e),
spiritual even, side of Artificial Intelligence. Like how, as of
writing, we're still using ChatGPT and other similar software largely as
tools, the characters in the story have found a way to utilized AI to be
"friends", dependable when you need them.

There are also interesting sub-plots that mirror our issues today,
at least one of which shocked me as it seemed out of place (for me).
Another one reminded me of that time when I was left with my *lola*
because my parents were overseas to work. I felt lonely then, badly in
need of friends around my age. Sometimes, I get to hangout with my
cousin who had been living next door.

The readers are invited to analyze their own beliefs as they go through
the philosophy presented to them.

Finishing the book gave me almost the same feeling after reading
*Never Let Me Go*, also by Ishiguro.

Finally, I recommend the book to people who tries to look in and out of
themselves for "what it means to love."

## *Bili Bili* at Cubao X

Gone this weekend to [Bili Bili](https://www.instagram.com/bilibilikayodyan/) (Instagram link)
event this weekend, 19 Aug.

It was a relatively short trip.
We browsed some stickers and zines.
I bought two zines from the stall of artist [Dione Kong](https://linktr.ee/dionekong) (Linktree link).

In their stall, they had a wire mesh where their artwork were displayed.
I hadn't seen anyone when I approached the stall.
So I might've been visible surprised when a person from behind the wire
mesh announced their presence by saying "Hello!"
Because of how the mesh hid this person behind, they joked,
"We're now ready to take your confession."
We laughed. I bought the two zines from them, and off I went.

Much, much later, *l'esprit de l'escalier* finally came to me with a
could've-been perfect reply to the confession quip:
"Forgive me, Father, for I have zine'd."
