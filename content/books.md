## Did not finish

Perhaps, the book is not as good as I hoped it would be. I would list
such books here, including the reason why I stopped reading it. This
will serve as a log for Future Me who might want to pick up the book
again.

***These lives were made for us to writhe in*** by **Justine Tiongco**  
**Why**: I do like the prose. However, since it's a collection of the author's
musings on video games and related ideas, I find hard to
relate to the work, because I may have outgrown video games. I
also feel like writing about video games must include lots of
related visuals of the game itself. The book does have
graphics and images, but they tend to be more abstract sketches of the
author.


***The Lonely City*** by **Olivia Laing**  
**Why**: Olivia Laing writes lovely in this collection of essays about
loneliness and how she had explored it through art. I just think it's
too... slow for me, and my own loneliness is impatient and wants to
dissipate. [While I have some reflections on some of the writings](/249/#reflections-on-the-lonely-city), it
could be that it's just too New York-y for me.
On a more positive note, Robin Rendle related the book to someone he was flirting with [on his post with the same title as the book's](https://robinrendle.com/notes/the-lonely-city/).

***Frankenstein*** by **Mary Shelley**  
**Why**: Probably not in the right mindset to read a sci-fi novel
written in early 19th century. I *might* get back to this if I remember
to forget how the first few pages were boring.

***how to grieve*** by **Jade Mark Capiñanes**  
**Why**: Author has
collected their wits and used it to build up *hugot* punchlines, which
may or may not be cringy. I appreciate the effort, though, but *conyo*
hugot, despite its potential to jab at jaw, is not for me.
