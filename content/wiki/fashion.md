[People have been expressing themselves](/communication) through the clothes they wear
for many, many millenia now.

I hope I'm not too late to this,
so I'm compiling any fit inspos that I find.
Probably the common theme (so far) is: How to Survive in the Heat.

## Yemeni Fashion

Women in Hadramaut, Yemen wear an all black abaya
and a conical straw sunhat called *madhalla*
when working in the fields.
What they're wearing is old yet effective [solarpunk](/solarpunk) solution to the hot
weather.

A madhalla is made from plaited strips of date palm leaves,
and the high peak promotes air circulation inside the hat.

The black color of the abaya actually keeps them cooler
by absorbing heat before it reaches the [skin](/skin).
The thickness of the fabric helps:
the outer layer does get hotter,
but the heat doesn't get transmitted to the skin.

## Bedouin Traditional Clothing

The basic "dress" is a tob or thobe of (usually) white cotton to the
ankles (silk and wool are also traditional; earth colors are also
common). The collar on the tob varies by
region. In Oman it is round with a button and tassel. Further north the
tassel gets dropped. Elsewhere a high collar (like an European clerical
collar) is worn. The tob has large triangular sleeves which are tied
back with a cord.

Under this Omani Bedouin wear a sarong. Many other wear sirwal. Around
Palestine the legs are bare.

Over the tob a striped kibr open down front with belt and/or shoulder
straps is worn. For non-manual workers a redan - with kimono shaped
sleeves to ground---reinforces their leisure status.

Headwear for most Bedouin men is a kufeya held in place with an igal of
camel wool. The kufeya is a square of fabric folded into a triangle with
a point on each shoulder. The igal can be richly decorated with metallic
threads.

## Barong Tagalog

I have mostly black and dark colors. It would be cool to have white or
light colored Barong in my rotation of drips. Here are some resources:

## Modern inspo/s

[Frugal Aesthetic](https://www.youtube.com/@FrugalAesthetic) is a
YouTube channel made by someone who "made a career out of stretched
comic sans" but also has in my opinion grounded, if not postmodern, take
on fashion. It is mostly male-centric, though, but not I would say
problematic.

## Fashion, function, both?

In order for to sustain it, fashion has to be fit for purpose and needs
to align with my lifestyle. Beyond cultural purpose, people get caught
up in the aesthetic side advertised in [social media](/social-media) that they end up
thinking less about just the functional purpose of clothes. They're
supposed to protect your body while you're out doing the things you need
to do. So, if any piece of clothing would get in my way (like physically
making less comfortable or restricting movement), then there is no point
in acquiring such items.

This return-to-functional is return-to-basics is a great way to remind
myself that I'm not really impressing anyone.

In some [cultures](/culture), there are specific clothes for a specific context.

### Loungewear, examples

In Japan, 部屋着 (heyagi)
means room clothes, and it's like the clothes that aren't pajamas but
clothes you don't wear outside because they'll get dirty. They're
meant for doing things around
your house.

In Indonesia, it’s called *baju rumah* (house
clothes) and these clothes are worn around the house in daytime.

Filipinos call this *pambahay*, literally meaning "for the house".

## Fashion, as cishet man

At least in my experience growing up, boys and men are told to not dress
flamboyantly, lest they be called gay, which in a [macho-patriarchal](/patriarchy)
society, could only mean derogatory. Moreover, in conservative Catholic
society, homophobia is ingrained early on.

Colors and prints and
different designs are fine so long as "flashy". For example, many would
consider floral prints on a cisgender boy/man to be flashy. (Another
tragedy of this conditioning against flowers had been my growing away
from them and from [plants](/plants) in general.)

Piercings, even simple earings, are frowned upon.

No manicures and pedicures, not even clear coat or black.

This policing of what people with dicks could wear has lead to more
boring choices for men in terms of looks and styles.
