This update is long overdue.

The cold breeze still comes in throughout the day,
despite being mid-February already.
I feel like we're loaning the temperate days from the future,
so that when 2024 or 2025 rolls around,
scorching hot days would be 99.9% of the time,
perhaps enough to clean this world of unwanted *germs*.

## Friends and Family

Isya and I have waltzed in and out of social events
since the start of the month.
To continue the metaphor,
our future selves loaned us extra extrovert energy for these affairs,
it looks like.

Hibernation is a promising activity that we both can slip into.

## Occupation

I am pushed a step up in our corporate ladder.
More workload, though, won't necessarily mean better compensation,
at least not right away.

Does this mean I'm loaning them more effort for free?

## Recovery, Relaxation

The good times these past few weeks usually come in a haze
of moving pictures and shoegazing.
I, of course, like spending them with loved ones around.
But don't we just need more of this and less... stress?

## Motivation

We wrap up this update
(which, in terms of effort,
I can only give a *hmph!* out of 10 score)
with a line I wrote in a journal last Valentine's day:

> I don't feel anything today.
> Coffeee keeps me in check,
> it seems,
> but that's hardly a scientific observation.

All I can say is, I may have had too much coffee that day.
When it's effect wore off,
caffeine allowed me to crumble on borrowed time.
