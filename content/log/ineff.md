- Updated the [Always Carry](/alwayscarry) project.
It's been recently rebranded (FKA Always Carry A Book) and relaunched, so please check out the online shop:

- Added new sections to the [Server](/server/) project.
- Footnote "highlighting" is now just changing the `font-weight` to `bold`[^1].

[^1]: This sample text becomes bold when you click from the footnote reference.
It returns to regular font weight when you return.

Today's short post is all about learning,
or at least, my attempt at it.

I'd like to think I've been reading more these days.
I know it's important to keep up with the times, but at the same time,
taking a break cannot be overlooked!
Information unused can and will occupy unnecessary mental space, which is just too precious today to be misused.

On the other hand, I also think that I may not be reading the most useful bodies of text to me.
Though that's not saying that every input *must* be useful.
We humans tend to ruin a lot of things, including ourselves, through the endless pursuit of optimization.
Sometimes, it's okay to be inefficient.

"Everything in moderation," Oscar Wilde said, "including moderation."

Learning new things creates new insights.
Unlearning some old ones can also connect different ideas, as one unclogs the path from bad data.

Anyway, here's a free idea:
Wouldn't it be great to buy and sit on the `yellowcab.pizza` domain?
