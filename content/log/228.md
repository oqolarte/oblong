We recently attended a media event by Rappler et al., with the chief
reason being able to see [Meredith Whittaker](https://mastodon.world/@Mer__edith) virtually talk to [Maria Ressa](https://www.rappler.com/author/maria-a-ressa/) about *[tech](/technology) and
its harms*.

Here were the panel discussions that we were able to attend that day,
along with some of my grounding questions to future-self:

- **Tech and the education crisis**: How can we use existing
  technologies to help improve the education in the Philippine setting?
  How can we make it more accessible to more learners and teachers,
  especially in far-flung areas? And with the ongoing AI hype, how can
  LLMs be utilized, if needed at all, to assist pedagogues in
  facilitating critical thinking among students?
- **Tech and its harms**: Aside from content moderation, data cleanup,
  training large language models, and general tech-related neo-slavery, what
  are the other ways that global north tech bros recolonize people from
  the global south, including the Philippines?
- **Content creation for a cause**: Can we actually subvert Big Tech by
  using their social media platforms in pushing forward a cause that we
  believe in? Can we rely on their algorithms to serve "value-adding
  content" to the audience that needs to see it at the right time?
- **How can we make cities climate-resilient?** Can we rely on the State
  and other relevant institutins to "election-proof" any long-term plans
  that could make cities climate-resilient? By making data open and
  available to the public, is it possible to make an [antifragile](/antifragile)
  community?

## Climate-resilient community

In an activity in one of the breakout rooms, the participants divided
into groups, each tasked to imagine a community that they would like to
live in.

Below is a snapshot of a community of the group I was in:


{{< figure src="/image/park.jpeg" alt="A crude drawing of a dream community, meant to represent the ideals of the individuals who collaborated in making it" caption="We didn't name this place" >}}

Our dream place, among other things, includes:
- a big park in the middle
- a road with designated bus stops
- a dedicated, protected bike lane, under which is the drainage system
- school
- low-cost housing with solar panels on the rooftop
- "Climate resilient integrated agency"
- high-end housing with solar panels and vertical garden on the rooftop
- animal park
- processing plant
- composting area
- urban garden
- maker space
- material recovery facility
- solar farm
- water reservoir
- community learning hub

Interestingly, after we collectively decided we were done with our work,
I overheard from other groups that they "should add government
facilities [on their community]." Looking at our work, we had none.
Speaking only for myself here, it might be because we felt we didn't
one. Perhaps, subconsciously, my group mates have already started
imagining a life outside of our current prevailing systems.
