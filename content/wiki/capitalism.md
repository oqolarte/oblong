Capitalism is, whether we like it or not, a strong idea,
[an elaborate Ponzi scheme](https://crimethinc.com/posters/capitalism-is-a-pyramid-scheme), that shapes our
lives and the space around us, by extracting from them to feed
the profit incentive---an endless growth on finite resources which, in
reality, cannot be sustained.
