## Brief review of *Alipato at Muog* (2024)

[*Alipato at Muog*](https://alipatoatmuog.com/) (Flying Embers and a
Fortress) is a documentary about the director JL Burgos's brother,
Jonas, and how Jonas has been missing since 2007 when he was forcibly
disappeared by, as the film shows, the military. An enforced
disappearance is considered to be "the arrest, detention, abduction or
any other form of deprivation of liberty by agents of State."

Beyond the grim story that surrounds and affects the victims and their
families and friends, the viewers are tagged along in imagined
non-gratuitous imageries and scenarios, artfully animated through chalk
drawings, supplementing the footages that the director himself had
taken. During the question-and-answer portion after the screening,
Burgos told the audience that it was hard not to get mad while filming
the videos; but remaining calm was tantamount in recording the actual
behavior of the subjects in that moment. I agree: after seeing the State
agents' behavior, it's impossible not to be incensed.

## Flame of courage

I recently found out that there's a monument dedicated to the almost
2,000 desaparecidos at
[Baclaran Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baclaran_Church)
(which by the way
has this almost-brutalist architecture that I love).

{{< figure src="/image/desap01.jpg" alt="A monument depicting a mother and a child, both of them standing atop a pedestal, both of them are mostly white. The mother is raising a torch, with the flame colored red. The child, a boy, is holding a tote bag on his right hand, and on his left, he is holding a picture of a man close to his chest." caption="*FLAME OF COURAGE*, July 13, 1994" >}}

Never forgetting
[Marcos Sr.'s signing of Proclamation No. 1081](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_law_under_Ferdinand_Marcos)
beginning his dictatorship on 21 Sep 1972; never forgiving the
wrong-doers until they are held accountable for the pain and suffering
they have caused and *continue* to cause; and, in solidarity with the
desaparecidos and their families and friends, some of whom I personally
know and am close to, we demand truth and justice.
