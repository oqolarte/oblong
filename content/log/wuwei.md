## On Time

In the past, I had romanticized lethargy as an inevitable part of my existence.
I would exit a stressed state of mind,
feeling slightly better, having done virtually nothing of significance.
Sometimes, this didn't affect me.
In fact, [*wu wei* 無為](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_wei) has saved me countless of times.

Though, doing something good enough would be a better alternative, wouldn't it?
But, some critics would argue that Now is the time to do it right---and
superfast at that!---;
we might not have the chance to do it again
when (not if) it starts falling apart.

But---*wu wei*, though.

## On Beginning

I write not because I understand something thoroughly.
Usually, it's me riffing off of something that's already copied from somewhere
else,
an idea so sticky I must do something with it.

Someone else has done it already;
and my response is to redo it myself,
if I found it interesting enough.
"To understand it," I would say,
"I must start from a point of interest."

## On Transitions

Em dash (---) emphasizes; parentheses minimize.

En dash (--) joins inclusive numerals, replacing the word "to".
It also joins the names of two or more places. E.g. items 3--5, Manila--Quezon.

There are other uses for each, I'm sure.
It's just that I don't know them all.
