Tell me how it works again:
are someone's morals inversely proportional to their wealth?
The common observation follows that as a person gets richer,
the less likely they would believe that manual labor
is worth their time.
Physical work almost always is outsourced,
except maybe when achieving and/or maintaining a desired physique.
And that's weird---isn't manual labor a form of physical exercise?

Yes, I'm still thinking about *that time* when a certain *Chris S.*,
a gym buff[oon], didn't carry *the* two heavy *balikbayan* boxes.
Instead, he watched their helper, a woman in her 30s or 40s,
significantly smaller than him, and me do the lifting.
"At least, she's getting paid," I thought.

Yes, I dislike recalling that time because it only reminds me of
how a collective agreement prevents certain subsets of living creatures
to be inconvenienced by mundane tasks.
When I do, I force myself to go to a calmer state,
so I can, you know, jazz into a smooth existence.

Speaking of smooth existence,
we are again left alone with the furry animals in the old house.
The relatives from abroad have flown back home.
Internal lethargy stabilizes, causing all sorts of familiar things.
Time feels a bit more normal again,
save for that one early Thursday morning when I woke up
feeling it's already Friday.
