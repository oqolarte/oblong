## Intro

This is the tendency that emphasizes abolishing human exploitation of nature,
leading to some variants like,
[social ecology](/social-ecology),
[post-civ](/post-civ),
[anti-civ](/anti-civ),
and [primitivist](/primitivism) conceptions.

## Our relationship with nature

When all my life I have lived in what I have recently come to believe is
a slow yet constant [collapse](/collapse); when the smart and so-called
progressive people around me had convinced me that humans' relationship
with nature could be anything but cynical; and when I have personally
experienced the spikes of climate catastrophes; it is hard to imagine a
future in which humans would have lasting positive interactions with the
[flora](/plants) and fauna around us. But if we are to learn from the wisdom of
Indigenous Peoples (IPs), harmonious coexistence not only is possible, it is
necessary for all things to thrive. More modern interpretations of
"sustainable living" include lowering the current standards of living.
But arguable, IPs, especially those of coastal old-growth forests, were
among the wealthiest in the world.

Indeed, we have changed the world so
much that many of the indigenous practices of living with nature is at
best frowned upon, at worst would merit jail time.

If we humans accept that we need to work together in keeping the planet
habitable for us all, we might just have a chance at preserving our species
longer.

Of course, the planet will heal in time. But its current [destruction](/destruction)
will leave millions, if not billions, dying who did not
[consent](/consent) to it. The reason why "we cannot have nice things" because generally
we are not nice to other people. Not everyone has to be friends---it's
impossible---but can we at least default to being kind?

## Looking at the current systems realistically

At this point, more than ideals, we should start standing up and try to
fix things.

The fossil fuel, the meat, and the stuff industries are all bad.

Individual choices do have an impact,
but they are also constrained by the systems we're in.

When the machinations of [capitalism](/capitalism) produce what is essentially trash,
we scramble to innovate---or, really, force ourselves---to repurpose it,
to appropriate it so it would fit in our communities. We've seen
single-use plastics remade to bags or pots.
But it's hard to sustain this cadence when trash comes in deluge, and we
only have several pairs of helping hands.

We can't keep repurposing capitalist garbage. And this is not limited to
just stuff: [economics](/economics) is something borne out of the
current Empire without any real practical use. It's analysis is based on
extractive nature of Empire. At some point, we would have to expropriate
the source which belongs to all of us.

The land belongs to no one *and* everyone. It cannot be bought or sold,
even though we humans like to officiate such transactions with real
estate laws, money, and borders, all of which are human-made constructs,
all of which the land itself does not recognize.

## Some ideas on how to start

That said, each of us have a personal responsibility.

While we still can, we should learn from the different symbiosis of
different creatures within our local environment. How else might we
harness our current conditions to improve the lives of others, both
human and non-human alike? Or is it too late to commune harmoniously
with them?

Individuals can
[stand together](/mutual-aid)---going from "me" to "we"---and
[demand big structural changes](/revolution). That could mean demanding
renewable energy, [better public transportation infrastructure](/transpo),
divestment from pollution industries, investment in plant-based
agriculture, a focus on rewilding, and better regulations on industry.

I---you, we---can do this, should do this by
[living the best way we can](/simple-living),
encourage others to do the same,
and get involved in some sort of [activism](/activism).
