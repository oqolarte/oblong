There's so much heated debate between vegans and omnivores online and elsewhere.

We have reached a point where some societies can already go full vegan,
while others simply can't,
whether it's because of their environment or something else.

## For the omnivores

Just don't farm animals in boxes for the entirety or most of their lives.
We should still be free to eat what we can,
as long as you don't add more suffering to this plane of existence.

Eating a corpse does nothing to the animal after it's dead,
and if everything is going to die eventually,
farming animals for meat is in of itself alright.
But if that farming involves the unspeakable torture,
it's unjustifiable and loathesome.
