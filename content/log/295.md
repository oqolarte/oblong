Nothing revelational for me in this 2007 album of Fall Out Boy, except
feeling good with the familiar singles I have known and liked.

EMO is decidedly a branch from white rock music. When it is exported to
the grittier and less fortunate people of Global South who understand
the English language, whatever unique thing that is bound to happen
would only manifest decades later, when the listener is now looking back
on their teens, jamming to the curly notes belted by pop-punk bands. It
is good. But not transcendental good.

My favorite track is ***I'm Like A Lawyer With The Way
I'm Always Trying To Get You Off (Me & You)***, which is almost like an
R&B propped up by slightly-grunged up pop riffs. What a love song it is,
especially with lyrics like "If I woke up next to you" (or if you listen
to any of the live performances, "If I wohm nesu you") and "Bulletproof
loneliness". If that's not emo, tell me what is.

**Rating**: 4 ‚ôæÔ∏è out of 5
