- Updated [tools](/tools).
- [Currently reading](/books/#currently-reading) *The Dawn of Everything* and *Braiding Sweetgrass*

Weirdly hot days are coming. Didn't I say the electric fans have become
oversized hair dryers, blowing only hot air, essentially cooking our
flesh?

Also: I hate feeling hopeless. I hate the feeling of dread. I don't like
to be strapped down immobile (so to speak) and coveyered into a violent
death while I watch unable---*disabled*---to do anything. Not my kink.

Finally, measuring at just the *right* points, we are living about 400 meters
from a police station, which in feet, is **1312**.
