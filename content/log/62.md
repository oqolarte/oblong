I received my second jab of AstraZenica last 9 Oct.
It's been two weeks since.
That must mean that the vaccine's effect should be in full swing now.

This does not mean that I'll be careless and reckless.
*Although* I have some out-of-town trips planned out in the coming weeks.
I'm not necessarily excited to be in them,
but I figured a scenery change wouldn't be so bad for mental
health, right?
