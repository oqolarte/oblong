## Brief review of *The Comfort of Strangers*

A short book by Ian "Macabre" McEwan, this vacation of two tourists in
an unnamed city turned to something unexpected. Critics say people are
not as dumb as the two main characters here, but I guess they have never
met a dumb white person ever.

## On motivation, recently

The things I have been meaning to do are in limbo. Lethargy seems to be
the right word for it. It's been months, I think,
[since it last appeared](/273) on this blog. Don't take me back to that
point, though. Not that it was a bad place (it was not), but I would
rather keep moving forward, one day at a time, whether my calls to
sanity are reduced to that of flesh.
