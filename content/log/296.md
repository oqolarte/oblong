If you told me that violence is never the answer AND NOT condemn all
forms of violence, don't @ me.

As one friend aptly put it:

> [Violence](/violence) is not the answer. It is the question. And the answer is yes.

You may be thinking of one specific white American male, but this also
applies to all people including bigots, racists, xenophobes, even corrupt
politicians who have spewed vitriol and weaponized hate to literally
harm and, worse, conduct genocide on people they *othered*.

This also applies to our personal lives in which bullies of all stripes
run rampant, [re]inserting themselves in familiar/familial situations
where they can manipulate the same set of characters they have
manipulated before. Bullies do not deserve any sympathy until they
repent for their sins.

*Be sure to let them live*, so they would have to witness a future they
hate unfold before them, one that's more [joyfully](/joyful-militancy)
[solarpunk](/solarpunk).
