Mathematical proofs start with axioms and self-evident statements as the
building blocks. Then, logic is presented, step by step, until it
reaches the conclusion, at which point it is called theorem.
Mathematical theorems follow this rigorous process, and when proven, are
true forever.

Scientific theories start with a hypotehsis which makes an informed
prediction based on available data. To test the predictive power of a
hypotehsis, scientists conduct experiments that prove (or disprove) the
hypotehsis. A successful outcome becomes evidence for the hypotehsis.
Scientific theories, are just a bunch of pieces of evidence for a
hypothesis, but the idea is that it cannot be proven with absolute
certainty. Mathematical proofs, on the other hand, are "absolutely true"
once proven.
