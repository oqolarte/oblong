It's happy hour again every hour, because somewhere, as they say, it's
time to relax and drink one's favorite beverage. They call this *happy
hour* and not, say, "team building" because, I think, it's meant to
represent festivities beyond constructing and/or mending
relationships among peers, even though the whole ordeal lasts typically
for more than 60 minutes. Plus, it has a low-budget, low-stakes ring to
it, an event that demands no grueling work for anyone who wants to get
involved---just fun.

But this particular happy hour, based on my limited understanding of the
word, is barely happy. I have talked to people; they dread of "going
back to reality" as if this trough of peace in the waves of stress isn't
real. I have [not] seen some things; I have [not] felt some feelings.
The consensus: boring.
And, to be honest, that's fine. It's nice to be away from "reality"
sometimes. Happy or otherwise, it's a needed break.
Although, I would have preferred
[not to resume work forever](/anti-work), but that won't be feasible,
will it?

At least, there's a pool. At night, dead gamugamos fill the shallow end
as they dive into it. At morning, their bodies will have been removed by
an invisible cleaner.

Pool contains, mostly, water which can be an all-surrounding metaphor
for people like me who cannot find in themselves to be relaxed while
submerged in it. What is mammalian dive reflex? To me, it's an attempt
to stay aware of the thalassophobia that gradually engulfs every
fiber of my being. Water is a powerful chemical: it can give and take
life. When swimming is a skill yet to be learned, I remain cautious
aronud large bodies of water. Though it's calmness almost seduces me
into coming over, I know what I can and can't do.

The happy ending for now must not be in the deepest end, must it?

[***Pool*** is also a love song by Paramore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3m8ElO9Y50Y).
