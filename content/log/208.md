## Brief review of *Expect Resistance*

This [field manual](https://crimethinc.com/books/expect-resistance) by
CrimethInc is "not one, but three books, each of which may be read as a
complete work unto itself." It reminds me of how prefiguring the many
possible realities as imagined *and* lived by revolutionaries is still
much preferred despite the many flaws of humans. These flaws colliding
can certainly create conflict, and indeed it is as natural as it is
inevitable. Why, then, must we create unfair and unjust laws and
legalize henchmen to enforce them so that we can all "co-exist". If we
can both thrive separately and still empower each other at the same
time, isn't that the more enticing path for all of us?

### More reflection

- Whenever I'm at odds with the forces that make this society function,
  I have to keep myself in check. What would be the effect of my
  resisting now alone? I don't know, likely none. It might be better to
  secure a safety net first before acting more radically.[^resist01]
- We as a society have pressure valves in place in the form of
  [adventure] tourism and recreation drugs. But I want to get a glimpse
  of a life beyond this. I'm getting tired of having commodified
  entertainment to keep my sanity.
- Not everyone who wants to change their lives has the capacity to read
  deeply into [theories](/politics). This does not mean that their
  thoughts and feelings are anything less than
  [those who "know" their theory](/academy).
- If "stealing is immoral," then we are right to [condemn capitalists](/capitalism) for
  stealing from the working class. And we are right to condemn all
  states for stealing our freedoms.
- Who decides which are my desires? The truth is, a huge fraction of it
  comes from the nature, nurture, and culture of those around me. Many
  times, I am just a recipient. Sometimes, a glitch happens, and I form
  and want my own desires. But it is fleeting. And it is always testing
  me.
- There's nothing wrong with wanting to be the main character of your
  own epic if it means taking matters to your own hands, AND NOT doing
  things you like at the expense of others' freedoms.
- When I say I want to escape the norm, I mean to exit the [social cancer](/empire) that destroys everything by transforming diversity with sameness. Usually, I fail---the cancer has gone deep. The cure, I think, is [to nurture the anomalous](/chaos).
- The psychiatrists, dentists, doctors, and the lucky healthcare workers
  who have found great pay in reducing harm, what are they thinking?
  What have they been up to? When their supposed success depends on the
  misery of others, one shall not be faulted to think that they are
  vultures circling around the bodies and minds of those [on the verge
  of] breaking down.
- We can aim for a more [transformative justice](/transformative-justice) for people who refuse to respect
  others' needs. But in a world, ruled by force, this will always be met
  with some form of [violence](/violence). As we defend ourselves,
  let's be careful not to lose our sights.
- Tourism destroys the observed in many ways, as it creates a border to
  alienate observers. Tourist spots become profit hubs for
  entrepreneurs, draining the local beauty.
- Media extracts its content from everyday life and weeds out the ugly
  parts before serving it back to us. We "relate" to it, and integrate
  its material into our daily speech and mannerisms, and becomes pop
  culture. We homogenize our culture through modernity, and I am
  thinking my place in it.
- Privileged access to truth is called objectivity, and those who cannot
  and/or will not access it is shunned and ostracized by those that do.
- To get rid of oppressors like [fascists](/fascism), sexists, statists, etc., in
  our midst, we must obsolete their beliefs [by continuously demonstrating](/prefiguration)
  that cooperation and [mutual aid](/mutual-aid), [despite differences](/community/#living-together-with-differences), will be better
  for us all.
- We see homelessness and destitution as the end result of not
  successfully participating in the Empire. So, we choose
  wage-slavery and work to get by. [What would happen if we all negate both](/anti-work)?
- If many of us believe that we are not capable of governing our own
  bodies and working with the community around us, it is because of
  generations of systematic and systemic abuse from states which have
  disabled us. Learning and believing otherwise would mean undoing all
  of this violence.
- [The act of committing] suicide is a hard choice to make, I would
  imagine, but it grants one final moment of agency. And that is all
  that matters when things get super gnarly and the oppressors would not
  stop until they have picked the bones clean.
- HISTORY, if we mean the documented narrative written by those
  privileged enough, cannot and will not encompass the entire Human
  Experience. Sure, we can opt to learn from it, if only to study what
  the bloody victors have included in the manuscript. But we can also
  learn from the "unvetted" sources---of the mundane, of oral tradition
  and folklore, of the dear-diary's that gather dust. Thankfully, many
  of them have survived...
- I AM A DREAMER who have stumbled upon, by luck, possible worlds from
  which our lives can both coexist and branch into. Worlds that seem to
  be just beyond the edge of this current tumultuous one, in which chaos
  is considered a bad thing, and not the natural thing that could
  sustain us if we only found the guts to wield it. I wonder how the
  splintering of realities to infinite outcomes must look from the void.

[^resist01]: Until when, I'm not sure.
