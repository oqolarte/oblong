## Is everything political?

"Not everything is political."

There is a gram of truth to it. No menace, like [politics](/politics)
is, can be omnipresent. But in the expanding Global Digitalization
governed by States, [Capitalists](/capitalism), and other tyrants of
oppression, [appropriating my data](/privacy), the gist of Me, without
my [consent](/consent) will always be political. And that's just one
thing to get agitated about.

We are suffering from multiple crises:
- [Israel conducting genocide against Palestinian people](/palestine)
- Climate catastrophes due to effects of climate change
- Rise of [fascism](/fascism) all over the world
- [Societal collapse](/collapse)

## Being intolerant of intolerance

Daily and on different places across the globe, we are facing violations
of human rights. Human identities are now inherently political, so long
as there are people obsessed with removing or silencing others
just for existing.

We simply cannot afford to be neutral about it. In fact, you might
already be talking about political things in your daily life without
your noticing it.

Have you complained about the effects of inflation and the rising of
prices of everyday necessities?

Have you complained about how the [local] government seems to be not
doing anything [to address natural disasters](/drrm)?

Even in the mundane things like greeting your neighbor good morning, you
are reinforcing the sense of [community](/community),
which in itself can be a political act when the timing is right. And guess
what, the timing is *always* right for these kinds of "small acts".

So long as our interconnected freedoms are tangled within the oppressive
forces of powers that be, we have the right to be political in our every
move. Because politics cannot be monopolized by State, lest we entrust
our lives solely to them and the Capitalists they serve.
