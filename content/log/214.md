As usual, I ask the question both in jest and earnest, as if to address
the two wolves living in me. I look around,
and the world around me continues to be a messy place. Am I raided by
wolves? So many things to
do with so limited time, [I have always wondered](/55) [if any of these are real](/121).

I *feel* it's Real: how can it not when my senses tell me so, when the
loves I give and receive empowers me to believe so?

## In earnest: Internet sleuthing

Ever since I came across detective stories through Sherlock Holmes, C.
Auguste Dupin, and Dr. Haledjian, I dreamed of being one someday. It
felt good solving cases and catching the bad guys. As I
grow older and a little bit wiser, I realize that reality is never that
simple. At least in fiction, I reach a closure. In real life, that
rarely happens.

To be detective is to be a private investigator, at least based on my
limited understanding on what a traditional detective is. I don't want
that. PIs tend to become pawns of police and the state.

Internet sleuthing is probably the next best thing. We have so many
tools available via [open source intelligence](/osint) (OSINT) that we can use
to really help, like
[detecting marine oil spill](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/how-tos/2024/08/30/marine-oil-spill-detection-guide/) and
[identifying explosive ordnance](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/how-tos/2024/07/31/a-beginners-guide-to-identifying-explosive-ordnance-in-social-media-imagery/).

Aside from the actions I do in the meatspace, OSINT is another arsenal I
am going to be adding to my list. This is one of the ways I try to make
sense of the turbulence we face at multiple fronts.

## In jest: Weirdness

I listed defining weirdness as good as one of my core
[personal principles](/personal-principles) (at least as of writing this).
I remember coming up with a random phrase---"soil shampoo"---and
*owning* it as if an accessory to show off to others. I would somehow
weave the phrase into blogs, status messages, etc. "Soil shampoo" means
nothing to most people, even to me, just like most of art, dare I say.
But just like weird art, it was good for my soul...

But is it?

I have mannerisms that some people might find odd (don't we all have
that?). Sometimes, people would ask me if I'm okay, to which, my
response most of the time is a casual smile and a slight nod.

I just think that this society is rarely kind to introverts. Accepting,
maybe, tolerant. But when people around me cannot put into words the
silence, they need to do something with it.

No wonder more and more people are turning silly, seeking validation
from parasocial "content" (or vlogs) in YouTube and in other video
streaming sites.
