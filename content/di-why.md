Doing side projects keep me sharp.
In the process, I'll try to document each step,
and publish whatever findings I might have here for public (re)viewing.

Like many, my interests oscillate wildly,[^smiths]
so the ideas listed here can't be lumped into one big category.
The length of list changes from time to time,
depending on my current situation.
"Life happens," they say.
I tend to agree.

Anyway, here is the list, in no particular order:

1. Wifi antenna
1. Water filter
1. Soap from used oil
1. Hand tools
1. Computer monitor upcycled from an old laptop
1. Laundry detergent
1. Repair, refurbish, and/or repurposing of different consumer electronics
1. Make a free and open-source software *and* hardware, but not necessarily found together in a single device, that a layperson would find useful
1. Bio-digester
1. Leather jacket made of mushrooms (mycelia jacket)
2. Wearable dashcam, powered by body heat (using thermoelectric generator)

As soon as I start working on an idea here, it will be migrated to the [Projects](/project/) page.
