Interesting research about why odors trigger powerful memories[^1]:
> [S]mells are a profound part of memory, and odors connect us to especially important memories in our lives, often connected to loved ones...
Odors connect us to important memories that transport us back to the presence of those people.

This is nothing new to me.

I have been triggered by various scents in random places.
Every time, I'm transported to the past by nostalgia.
