## No sooner than it draws air

It took me a while to update this space.
Or more accurately,
I never got around to pushing the recent changes to live
until now.

Life gets in the way of creating and destroying things
that are worth writing about.
This has inspired me---us---to prune what needs to be pruned.
To let go, one by one, things that no longer matters to us,
even if it takes a while,
even if tests our Patience.

But I have been writing, analog and offline.
Say what you will about pen and paper,
but it gets the job done seeing on an external object
the thoughts I have.

Some nights ago,
I had so much brain activity
that I didn't want to waste the thoughts on quickly typing them out
on my computer.
That night, I "slowed down" and processed each idea,
each memory, through frantic jotting or rappid logging,
whichever fits.
