Contrary to my initial non-scienitific forecast,
it still feels cold in evenings until the sun rises the following
morning. That's relatively good news for people who lives in the tropics.
According to PAGASA, "[La Ni√±a condition is present in the Tropical Pacific,](https://www.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/press-release/170)"
which might last until March 2025.

In this supposed bed weather, though, it's a bit hard to sleep for
various reasons. My circadian rhythm might be out of sync, nor am I
always well-rested when I do finally get some sleep. On top of that,
subconscious thoughts sometimes come
to me without my calling them, with the unintended side effect of
inducing thermal reactions where there shouldn't be---just another
groove I must ride out sometimes. Dreams are rarely boring so long as
I contain them to myself.

This restlessness, though, invited a recent anomaly. One night, when
we're about to go out for dinner, I lost my wallet, which comprises
two cards, a few bills wrapped around them, and a paper clip holding them all
together (for reference, see [photo of my daily carry](/tools)).
I told my supposed dinner-mates to go ahead without me, as I
would look for my wallet first. As it turns out, I didn't actually lose
it, because it was already in the fromynt right pocket of my I changed
into for the dinner. Imagine how frustrated must I have felt, how down I
went after that panic, because:

- I swear I already checked my pockets many times, but somehow the shape
  of my wallet, its stiffness, its overall feel, did not register on my
  hand;
- there might be a flaw in how I design my daily carry and how I quickly
  and mindlessly stuff them onto my person;
- there could be an undiagnosed mental health problem; and/or
- am I choosing realities now?

Any of the above do not spell luck for me.

"It could also be just hunger," my partner said. "You should've come
with us on that dinner, and we would've found your wallet after."

"That's normal and shouldn't be a concern," my siblings said when we
were hanging out, drinking the night (the following night) away, hearing
their silly obsession with
[Kuromi](https://hellokitty.fandom.com/wiki/Kuromi) (I'm more of a
[Gudetama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gudetama) enjoyer; [to each their own](/anti-work)), hacking the systems that try to impose its
rules on us. Fun night, that one.

But the next day nursing a hangover (HO), not so much. For the most part
of the day, I was attached to the bed, save for going to the toilet to
do business. By evening, I was done with my HO phase, and was mobile
enough to actually go to where we all should've dined together a few
days prior...
