[Transformative justice](https://transformharm.org/tj_resource/transformative-justice-a-brief-description/)
(TJ) is a political framework and approach for responding to violence,
harm, and abuse that changes our communities so that most harm
("crimes") would drastically decrease, an approach that's different from
the current carceral systems in place.

We can ask: can crimes of passion be obsolete when we no longer see people
as things to lose or possess?

Consider: Things like theft or property destruction canâ€™t exist if many
of our spaces are communal, and people have enough that they don't feel
like they need more.

[If a community wants to help each other](/mutual-aid), then each
crime is unique and personal. The aggrieved and aggressor are likely
neighbors. A damaged connection might be still be there
and can be healed. If the aggressor is remorseful and
penitent, then the aggrieved may forgive them, and the community might
hold them to certain reparations.

TJ aims to not reproduce the [violence](/violence) of state prisons.
[Isolation and torture are not effective means of reforming](/abolition) those who
hurt others, only deepens wounds.

## Apologies, Reparations

When you make an apology, it doesn't belong to you anymore. It's up to
the party you've wronged whether to forgive you, and you have to be
prepared for whatever response.

Don't apologize to get forgiveness. That's not an apology but a
transaction. Recognize the mistake you made and the damage you did, try
to lessen the damage, and make sure you don't make that mistake again.
Expect nothing in return for this work you must do.

## Facing discomfort

To realize the impact of your own harmful actions can be heavy and
uncomfortable; and owning up to it is only the first step.

If, let's say, you violated someone's [consent](/consent) and you the
harm-doer are the one feeling worse, the least you can do is to
apologize (see previous section).

If you have ever hurt or harmed anyone, healing cannot begin by escaping
accountability just because you don't like the uneasy feeling of facing
the consequences of your action.
