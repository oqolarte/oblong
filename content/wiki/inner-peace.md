Notes seeded by reading *Being Peace* of Thich Nhat Hanh.

## "Suffering is not enough"

To bring happiness and peace to others, we must also feel and find them
in ourselves. To do that, [appreciate the simple things](/simple-living),
things that we
take for granted. We can find solace even in our breathing, which is
what most meditation is about.

The moment to *be* alive is the present moment. It means we are not
delegating our lives to a distant future. [Here and Now we are needed](/prefiguration),
and we should also not take that for granted.

We have sovereignty over ourselves even though sometimes it doesn't feel
that way. The [Empire](/empire) constantly tries to take away our control,
even our
attention, even our realities. But deep down, we have the final say on
what happens for us. "We have the seed of everything in us, and we have
to seize the situation in our hand, and recover our sovereignty."

Choosing inner peace is effecting peace. It is a tumultuous world we
live in, indeed, and starting ripples from where we are---like a simple
act of smiling at others, and believing in that smile---will be felt.

## "The three gems"

Clarity is often achieved in a calm state. Instead of panicking, try to remain calm, exude calmness even to people who are going lucid.

### Buddha

Buddha is in all of us. It is a state of being able to wake up, know, and understand is innate in humans. Understanding is not easy. One needs to be more compassionate to others, to look deeper than the surface, and to be aware to do actively do that. And it is the realization that these acts of understanding become real and true.

### Dharma

Dharma is what Buddha taught. It is the way of understanding and love, and how to make them real. But, one cannot use words to describe Dharmakaya, or body of Dharma, much like in another philosophy, Taoism, one cannot really capture accurately the Tao in any word. Reality is free from all adjectives, and so is the nature of Dharmakaya.

Dharmakaya exists in many ways including, but not limited to, the teacher themself, the words and sounds through which Dharma is manifested, and even in the non-actions (reminding us again of wu wei in Taoism) that help more than if we do a lot. A tree is a great example of _someone_ preaching Dharma through non-action: just by existing and not doing anything, it has served its purpose. (Ofc, we can be pedantic about it and say that the tree is actually doing something like photosynthesis, carbon-capturing, soil retention, etc. but these are just part of its existence, I would say.)
