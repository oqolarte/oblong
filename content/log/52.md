Thanks to both the still-high COVID daily infections,
and the looming new (in the country) delta variant,
Metro Manila will, again, be under a lockdown in the coming days.
Restocking the essentials becomes a non-negotiable task in the to-do list.

One of which is cycling "downtown" to get coffee beans.
A kilogram of it will last about a month
for two (sometimes three) people drinking caffeine daily,
so I only bought that amount.
We're careful to overstock;
coffee beans that don't get used for a long time
will degrade (citation *knea*ded).

The roundtrip is roughly 23 km
of wildly varying elevation.
Thanks to that errand,
I have now X'd today's workout quota.

In an attempt to prolong my life,
I've been doing exercises since the pandemic started.
That's more than a year now.
It's nothing serious;
just basic HIIT and calisthenics,
if there's even a difference between the two.
I want to be consistent in my schedule,
but willpower depletes fast,
and I can only work with what I have.
But something, I believe, is better than nothing.

When there's an opportunity, I add cycling to my exercise.
Actually, such opportunity presented itself earlier in the morning,
hours before the downtown errand.
Someone from a nearby village ordered two bags of tofu cat litter,
from [my partner's little operation](https://alwayscarry.netlify.app/home).
I delivered the bags myself to the client.[^delivery]
I consider it a win-win for all parties involved.

[^delivery]: The gimmick is,
if the client is from one of the four villages nearby,
delivery, by me on a bike, is free,
unless it's way more than I can carry in a backpack.

**In another news**,
after some five months of unemployment,
I have a new work now starting on Monday.
