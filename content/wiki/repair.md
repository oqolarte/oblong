Instead of throwing away stuff because it's broken, consider if it can
be fixed. This is how we can start rethinking about our waste. We should
have the right to repair the stuff we bought.

{{< toc >}}

## Preamble

The wastefulness of Global North negatively impacts the overall quality
of life for those in Global South. So, while the pressure should be
applied more on the former, it's in all our best interest to keep things
functional for as long as we can maintain it that way. Not only that,
it's also in the best interest of our environment, to not just throw
away broken things without even trying to repair them. The least we can
do is to wear them down until they can longer be fixed, so we don't have
to be digging up earth for precious metals or cutting down trees for
wood, or pull crude oil for plastics, or you know, extract and exploit
labor from the Global South.

[Here in the Philippine archipelago](/pilipinas),
many of us repair our stuff when it breaks,
or we ask someone who knows how to do so. Thanks to our many skilled
technicians, mechanics, electricians, plumbers, masons, tailors,
artisans, woodworkers, metalworkers, dressmakers, weavers, and every
repairperson in between, because without them and their ingenuity,
keeping our stuff working for as long as possible would be a hard life.

## 7Rs

1. Reduce: Bring your own
2. Reuse: Find new uses for old objects
3. Repair: Fix broken items before you toss them!
4. Regift: Donate unwanted items
5. Recover: Compost your food scraps
6. Recycle: Know your program and recycle right
7. [Refuse](/refuse): Don't consume what you don't need to

Recyling has become a fad and is no longer the bridge to a sustainable
future. The term is slapped on brands to encourage consumers to do it,
that is, shift the blame on them. But when buying new has been
incentivized by both state and market to be cheaper, why recycle?

As I have suspected, [economics](/economics) is flawed because it
doesn't account for *all* costs. It's not accurate to just analyze
economic activity without knowing the effects of external costs.

We need to have a "[just transition](/revolution)" to have a
[sustainable future](/eco-anarchism). This might mean different things
to different people, but we can't simply shock the system and ignore the
vulnerable minority that will be affected. A good, relevant example of
this just transition is saying No to Jeepney Phaseout.

## Maintenance work

Maintenance work is real, hard work that often goes unnoticed until
something breaks because no one looked after the thing.

Marketers have yet again contributed to the de-skilling of people on
repair, when they promote "maintenance-free" items on their products.
Thanks to entropy, nothing is fully maintenance-free, and things
eventually break down. But we can fight it; repair and maintenance is a
battle against entropy.

Home has always been the first repair shop that we know. But
[modern conveniences](/convenience) brought by consumerism has turned it into a de-skilling
center as well.

The ability to maintain, thus, is helpful in
prolonging the useful life of an object, and should be taught---for
example, by sharing good maintenance and troubleshooting
[documentations](/documentation)---to empower consumers to keep their items.

Yet, the issue remains: people consume more, and that many of
them still prefer buying new things instead of repairing. This curse
plays a role in the large scale environmental damage, and it might be
the beginning of the end of humanity. It would take more than 99% of
the human population to coordinate if we are to save ourselves from our
own greed. Convenience drives capitalism.

## Repair as Political Act

Thinking about repair allows us to be [agents of change](/activism). But
beware the agency that is self-absorbed. Remember: we are the average of
the people around us.

In an increasingly consumerist society where buying new is rewarded with
feel-good sensations, repairing broken things to reuse and repurpose,
then, becomes a radical act.

"Placemaking" introduced third places in communities. (For more info on
placemaking, read this: [What is Placemaking?](https://www.pps.org/article/what-is-placemaking))
We need more third places to hangout with our [community](/community)---perhaps to conduct
regular repair workshops---and start
[stronger relationships](/friendship) that will help us not only with
reducing our negative impact to the environment, but ultimately reach
our higher selves.

It's important to introduce kids to simple yet effective tools like
hammer and screwdriver, so they'd appreciate their use, more so in times
of tinkering and repairing. I for one dismantled a lot of my electronic
toys with a philips screwdriver when I was a curious kid. Sadly, though,
life happened, and my curiosity dwindled.

To attain sustainability, we need to increase our collective "repair
literacy" or our ability to maintain the usefulness of things as time
wears them down.

## Common Malpractices

Big companies will try to maintain as much control over their products as possible by:

- closed-source schematics;
- monopoly of replacement parts, if there's any at all;
- limiting the number of "certtified" service centers;
- making it hard for third-party technicians to get accreditation;
- labeling independent repair shops as "unauthorized";
- using proprietary tools *and* limiting the public's access to them;
- planning for obsolescence, i.e., designing the thing to eventually
  break down after a set period of time;
- and other things that can only be "good for the[ir] business."

As you can already tell, [maximizing profit](/capitalism) does not end with you buying
their product.

## What can be done

Consider what would happen to stuff we
end up giving/throwing away.

Apart from repairing, or having the thing repaired by someone who
knows how, here are a few more ideas.

### Manufacturers

Manuals and schematics (two copies, ideally: one hard copy, one soft
copy, and the latter should be readily available on the internet,
preferably under permissive license[^license]) should be provided along
with the product, including, among others, the necessary steps to
maintain it, troubleshooting problems, and a working list of entities
and/or individuals capable of more technical repair should we find the
problem beyond our skills.

[^license]: There are many permissive licenses to choose from.
Start here: https://creativecommons.org/

Replacement parts, and the needed tools, should be made available to everyone.

Products should be [designed](/design) to be repaired, not thrown away.

### End users

Read the manual. This documentation will tell you the do's and dont's
when using the product. The good ones even explain how to troubleshoot
should there be a problem, or at least point you to a direction (e.g.
website for more info).

If it applies, do a preventive maintenance, which in its core is just
regularly checking your devices, and/or fixing them before they break.
If you're not sure how to do this, ask a trusted technician.

### No buying (including some nuances)

Not buying anything new is a noble endeavor, indeed.
However, remember that it's the lack of competition and closed
ecosystems that profiting from planned obsolescence. How else can we
move towards lowering the repair costs than replacement? One idea is
demanding manufacturers to provide at least 10-year warranty for
appliances that are reasonably expected to be used for that long or
more, like it's done is EU.
