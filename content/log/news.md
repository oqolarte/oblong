One's life collects experiences as one oscillate between the good and bad news.

## Bad news

Our very own himbo cat has done it again!
In his boredom he cut the patch cord of our wifi router that we [already had replaced](/simplex).
I keep calling him *himbo*
but maybe disrupting our boring lives is part of his grander plot?

## Good news

No big deal, though.
We immediately got the replacement.

In the interim, Isya and I tried to play games in `/usr/games/`.
Text based games can be fun, but the ones included here got boring real quick.

## Bad news

Someone close to us has a flu.
Nothing is certain yet, so we don't want to jinx it.
It could just be the rapidly changing weather, for all we know.

## Good news

Something came in the mail about my having a better near-future.
More on that later.

*This is Day 4 of [Old Computer Challenge](/old-computer).*
