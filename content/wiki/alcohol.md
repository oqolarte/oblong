## Isopropyl alcohol vs Ethyl alcohol

When cleaning electronics, what to use?

### Isopropyl alcohol

Lower polarity than ethanol,
thus slightly better at dissolving oils and adhesives which is the main application in households.
Toxic upon ingestion, as it is metabolized to acetone in the body.
Cheap, as production methods are simple.
Usually very clean and dry.

### Ethyl alcohol

Higher polarity, so its solvent ability is different,
and more towards that of [water](/water).
Speaking of water, this also causes ethanol to absorb more of it,
and common store grades are between 80-95%,
the remainder being water.
So it leaves a bit of conductive water behind = no-go for electronics,
you will need 96%+ for this, preferably.
Ethanol is usually more expensive.
Ethanol is essentially toxic, but less so than isopropyl alcohol.
Denatured ethanol is cheaper,
but can get you seriously sick if you drink it,
and can leave solid residue behind on electronics.
