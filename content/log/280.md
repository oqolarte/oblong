I woke up to the sad news that an uncle whom I consider a mentor has
died. I am not sure what to feel, but moving around does not do much.

I want to remember the lessons that he taught me, directly and
indirectly, some of which I'm posting here for posterity:

1. He always recommended that I read the Holy Bible, and that I should
   **start with the Gospels** as these pieces of literature bring to
   light Jesus Christ's teachings. Christ as a thinker was, in my
   opinion, ahead of his time. While I don't consider myself religious,
   I acknowledge many of Christ's philosophy still holds up today, more
   than two thousand years later.[^christ] Here is a banger
   (non-verbatim): "Love God above all; and love yourself as you love
   your neighbor." And according to Jesus himself, it's the same
   thing![^golden-rule]
2. He highlighted the **importance of [repair and maintenance](/repair)** of the things we already have. If it could be
   fixed, he would at least give it a try. True enough, families and
   friends consider him as an all-around handyman.
3. In our last face-to-face interaction, as in the few ones prior, he
   would say weird things like praises *for* Trump and Putin, touting
   their being "strong men." (Now that US has bombed Iran because Trump
   ordered it, I wonder what would be his take on this.) He would also
   go on rants about the status then of Roman Catholicism under the late
   Pope Francis, branding the late pope's relatively progressive
   politics as evidence of coming of the Anti-Christ; and he would share
   some things he learned from theology scholars he agreed with. I think
   he had these views because of his exposure to the algorithms of major
   [social media](/social-media) sites like Facebook and YouTube,
   putting even brilliant people like him in large echo chambers. One of
   my takeaways is this: **go outside, "touch grass," and meet people
   where they are.** The realities presented in social media are
   different from what we experience "in real life."
4. My uncle had always been a heavy smoker and drinker. He did not care
   whether the literal air around him would get so polluted, especially
   during his chain-smoking sessions. This was especially bad when he
   was around non-smokers. I say to that: **Never again to any addictive
   and self-destructive vices**. The time to care for self should have
   been many years ago. The next best time is *now*. Caring for one's
   [health](/health) is also caring for others, and vice versa.
5. Being steeped in the Holy Bible, and being the favorite son of his
   father, he would spew misogynistic rhetorics from time to time. As I
   grow older and away from him, I have started to **unlearn toxic
   masculinity and undo [Patriarchy](/patriarchy)** within me. To me,
   that means: learning how to ask for help, building and maintaining
   important relationships with friends and familiies, and appreciating the
   roles of people of every color or stripe, among other things.

These only show that like most of us, he too contained multitudes.

[^christ]: Some would argue that there's a socialist tinge in his
teachings. Regardless, people have created numerous
[religions](/religion) around him, some even leading to [fascist regimes](/fascism).

[^golden-rule]: In his write-up "[Ordo Amoris](https://www.hauntologies.net/p/ordo-amoris)", Elia Ayoub
discusses this, and more, through observing the clown that is JD Vance.
