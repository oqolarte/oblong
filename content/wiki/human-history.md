## On inequality

[Jacques Rousseau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau)
believed that early humans lived in egalitarian bands of
hunter-gatherer; and that the Agricultural Revolution led to
civilization, science and philosophy, specialization, along with states,
militarism, and bureaucracy. In his essay *Discourse on the Origin and
the Foundation of Inequality Among Mankind*, he argues that private
property is the source of social inequality. He said the the state of
nature was only a thought experiment, even affirming that people were
born as a blank slate, i.e., neither good nor bad; and that
[*state of nature*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_nature)
should not be considered as the absolute truth by scholars.

[Thomas Hobbes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hobbes), on the
other hand, believed that it is in human nature to be in a constant
state of war; and that progress is made possible by institutions like
state, police, and bureaucracies. He believed that [hierarchy](/hierarchy) and
domination is part of human instinct, and that creating laws would
temper the worst of our instincts.

The [Gini coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient),
developed by Italian and sociologist
[Corrado Gini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrado_Gini), measures the
inequality among values of a frequency distribution, such as income
levels. (Side note: Corrado Gini was a eugenicist and an advocate of
[fascism](/fascism).)

If we reduce the entire Human History to a Gini coefficient, we will
*necessarily* conclude silly things. This is because the the quality of
life of, say, a forager of Paleolithic era cannot be equated to, or even
viewed through the lens from, our Information Age one. Foragers, to some
anthropologists, were even considered the OG affluent society.

On one hand, Hobbes believed that all our actions would inevitably be
intertwined with the entire Human History, all of which already
predetermined by God. On the other hand, Rousseau believed whatever we
humans do, we could undo, ot at least do differently, knowing it will be
difficult.

### Complex lives, then and now

David Graeber and David Wengrow (authors of *The Dawn of Everything*)
argues that Paleolithic lives of hunter-gatherers were far more complex
and interesting than modern-day state of nature theorists  would ever
guess.

Psychologist Steven Pinker, self-proclaimed "rational centrist," argues
that we should be optimistic, and that life has drastically improved
across the board. He talks about this in detail on his book
*Enlightenment Now*.[^pinker] But has it really, say, for the Black
peoples everywhere? How about for [Palestinians](/palestine)? How about
for the Indigenous Peoples? And don't get me started on
non-humans---farmed animals, sea creatures, all the flora and fauna
suffering from multiple
environment catastrophes caused and accelerated by human activity---have
their lives improved, too?

[^pinker]: He also talks about this in shorter formats, like talks and
interviews. As a start, I referred to this transcript of an interviiew:
[Steven Pinker: Can Numbers Show Us That Progress Is Inevitable?](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/639229357)

To be fair, Pinker claimed:

> We will never have a perfect world. And it would be dangerous to seek
> one. But there's no limit to the betterments we can attain if we
> continue to apply knowledge to enhance human flourishing. This heroic
> story is not just another myth... As we learn more, we can show which
> parts of the story continue to be true and which one's false, as any
> of them might be and any could become.

Reductive questions like "Are humans inherently evil or innately kind?"
will get answers bereft of nuance. Firstly, of course, because it's a
yes-no question that almost expects a simplistic binary answer. But
secondly, and more important, life is more interesting than the limits
of our imaginations of how humankind could/should/would behave based on
the specific context they are in at a point in life.

### Market economy

Graeber and Wengrow question whether market economy has always been
universal. But there have been
[people like those in Massim Islands](https://ioa.factsanddetails.com/article/entry-554.html) off in
Papua New Guinea who go on dangerous sea expeditions to trade heirlooms
and their histories. To them, the adventure in spreading of one's name
is itself its own reward. Knowing this, it does stretch our
understanding of what a "trade" is or should be. Eric Kjellgren further
explains in *Oceania: Art of the Pacific Islands in The Metropolitan
Museum of Art*:

> By far the most important trading activity in the Massim is the kula,
> a complex system of exchange relationships between individuals on
> different islands, through which ceremonial valuables in the form of
> necklaces and armbands continually circulate. Success in the kula,
> which remains vigorous today, is the primary means through which an
> individual achieves wealth and renown. The participants, valuables,
> and vessels involved in the kula are surrounded by rituals,
> restrictions, and magic intended to ensure a safe voyage and success
> in obtaining the most coveted examples of the valuables. The
> accumulation, exchange, and display of ceremonial valuables formed,
> and continues to form, one of the central themes in the arts and
> cultures of the Massim region. Many types of Massim valuables consist
> of exaggerated versions of ordinary objects---such as armbands or
> implements---which are too large, too small, too fragile, or too ornate
> for practical use.

### Disability care of the past

In a video by YouTube channel **fig tree** titled
"[Romito 2: Disability in Prehistory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VODwCoYukF8)"
the presenter
talks about [**bioarcheology of care**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/310771734_Tilley_L_2012_The_bioarchaeology_of_care)
(a contextualized approach for interpreting the experience of disability
and health-related care response in the past, based on evidence for
disease found in human remains; developed by Lorna Tilley) through
examples discovered in the field of archeology:

- [**Man Bac 9**](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna32318818): A paralyzed
  young man who suffered from [Klippel-Feil Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klippel%E2%80%93Feil_syndrome)
  was totally dependent on others for his daily survival including
  meeting his basic needs, but also intensive nursing to prevent or
  treat common complications like bed sores, urinary tract and
  gastrointestinal problems, etc.
- [**Shanidar 1**](https://source.washu.edu/2017/10/shanidar/): A
  Neanderthal experienced a crushing blow to his head, leaving him
  possibly blind on the right eye, deaf on right ear, and limp on right
  side of body. He must have relied on the care of his social group to
  survive up to 35 to 45 years old.
- [**Romito 2**](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1057635): A 10,000-year-old burial site revealed an adolescent man with severe
  dwarfism, and was taken care of his community despite being anomalous
  to participate in typical hunter-gatherer survival activities.

These three examples are anti-theses to Hobbesian thought that
prehistoric lives were "nasty, brutish, and short."

## Myth of progress

There is no such thing as a "noble savage." The term likely originated
from arrogant Western "intellectuals" who cannot imagine that other
complex societies were formed and have existed outside their sphere of
influence long before colonialists and conquistadors were beached on
their shores. The phrase "noble savage" did not mean nobility, but
French observers used this term on men who did the hunting and fishing,
which, in France, were things only noblemen did.

## Multifaceted human politics

Humans are very much alike, down to the DNA level. Even our
ancestry---Africa, from which modern humans first appeared---is the
same. But the slightest perceived difference has led to all sorts and
degrees of suffering and [violence](/violence).

It is true that we have the instinct to dominate or subjugate others,
like many other primates and animals. But what makes us human is our
ability *to choose NOT to*. Christopher Boehm further explains this idea
of [humans as political animals](/politics): "The ability
to [ruminate on possible futures](/prefiguration)
that a society can have, make explicit arguments why it should take one
path over another...[t]his makes us humans 'political animals.'
Extending that, we can say the the personal indeed is political.

If we do not underestimate what tens of thousands of years mean in
[Upper] Paleolithic Period, we could imagine that pockets of human
societies across time and global space, have been exploring different
social arrangements, and that we are not just stuck to being either
inherently hierarchical or innately egalitarian.
