Confronted with the [nihilism](/nihilism) inherent to life,
the obvious lack of meaning,
[the senseless cruelty and violence](/violence),
it's only natural to feel [hopeless](/hopelessness).

Even knowing this,
I try to make my own meaning in this life.
In fact, I make it with the friends and family.

But absurdly simultaneously embracing and rejecting life as-it-is gives
me a better ability to make meaningful change in the world, and make
myself happy, so why would I not do it?
