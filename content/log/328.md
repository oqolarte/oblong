In which I talk about my recent visit at a hair salon, but first...

## Agentic AI future?

The lead solutions architect at work is convinced that "the future is
agentic AI." We were in between virtual meetings when he said this, as
casual as one would say, "Tomorrow the sun will shine again."

I told my friends I didn't know how to react to that, but more
accurately, I kind of expected tech bros to laud odd stuff like this,
especially when said tech bros work at "AI-driven" startups. I just did
not know how to rebut at that moment.

## New hairdo

After more than nine months of growing it out, I recently had my hair
cut.

We were in the mood to try a new salon.

The non-binary hairdresser assigned me, after assessing the state of my
hair, felt compelled to roast me, all in good fun of course.

"Do you not know how to style your hair?"

Not a minute into cutting: "Wow, your hair is so thick, it's as if I
already cut the hair of seven human heads."

The hairdresser also shared a prediction: "When you're 50, your hair
will both go grey and fall off!"

"At the same time?" I asked.

"At the same time," they confirmed. "And you will remember me and this
day when that starts happening. If you won't remember, you better tell
your acquaintance that so they will remind you." And so here I am,
writing it here for posterity!
