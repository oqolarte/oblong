Privacy is a human right. I'm not doing anything illegal, and yet I have
curtains installed on our windows, and I close and lock the door of the
toilet and bath when I do *things* inside---because the public doesn't
need to know what I do at privacy of my own space.

With the convenience brought about by [technology](/technology), more
and more people are foregoing their privacy, both digital and physical.

When it comes to our data, we should be deliberate on how we handle it,
where and how we hand it over to people and/or services, where it's
stored, and that we understand where it's stored.

## Why privacy matters in security

[Security](/security) and privacy have a close relationship.

When companies and organizations with profit motives start collecting
and sharing your data to other businesses without your consent, like
they have been doing since the late 1990s, we should be concerned; the
more organizations collect data, the more vulnerable it is to being
abused, misused, and stolen.

## Legally protected information

Data is more than just a bunch of 1s and 0s being processed by a
[computer](/computer). Data can represent someone's personal thoughts,
actions, and choices. It can represent a purchase, a sensitive medical
decision, and everything in between. For this reason, data owners should
be the ones deciding whether or not to share their data.

Securing data can be challenging. In large part, that's because data
owners generate more data than they can manage. As a result, data
custodians and stewards sometimes lack direct, explicit instructions on
how they should handle specific types of data. Governments and other
regulatory agencies have bridged this gap by creating rules that specify
the types of information that organizations must protect by default:

- **PII** is any information used to infer an individual's identity.
  Personally identifiable information, or PII, refers to information
  that can be used to contact or locate someone.
- **PHI** stands for protected health information.  In the U.S., it is
  regulated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
  (HIPAA), which defines PHI as “information that relates to the past,
  present, or future physical or mental health or condition of an
  individual.” In the EU, PHI has a similar definition but it is
  regulated by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
- **SPII** is a specific type of PII that falls under stricter handling
  guidelines. The S stands for sensitive, meaning this is a type of
  personally identifiable information that should only be accessed on a
  need-to-know basis, such as a bank account number or login
  credentials.

## Quick tips

1. Encrypt your data as much as you can when it is being stored at rest.
2. When your data is transiting over the internet,
   [make sure it's also encrypted using TLS/SSL](/network-security).
3. Within your organization, you should think about who has access to
   that data. It should be almost no one if it's very sensitive. And in
   the rare cases where somebody does need to access that data, there
   should be a record of that access, who accessed it, and a
   justification as to why. And you should have a program to look at the
   audit records for that data.
