Of the ten books I have read this year, my top 3 are:

1. [EXPECT RESISTANCE](/208/#brief-review-of-expect-resistance) by [CrimethInc](https://crimethinc.com/)
2. [All About Love: New Visions](/love) by bell hooks
3. [Fermat's Enigma](/242/#brief-review-of-fermats-enigma) by Simon Singh

Hopefully, I would have more time and/or motivation to read more books
on 2025.
