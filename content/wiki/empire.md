**Empire** is "the name for the organized catastrophe in which we live today."

{{< toc >}}

## Intro

It's more of a collection of process, rather than a singular
mass/entity, that includes "the most brutal forms of domination to the
subtlest inculcation of anxiety and isolation."

Empire works hard to maintain itself by separating us from our
capacities, preventing us from fully realizing them. When it creates
shame and fear, it also makes the solutions, making us dependent on its
systems. Its machinations have sucked the life out of all things borne
out of 10,000 passionate and brave things and walled them within the
false promise of safety and security, in the name of Profit and the
Power it provides to a few people.

Empire reacts to modern rebellion by innovating new ways of *subjection*
(Dean Spade's more complex term for "oppression"):

- prisons as "evil containers"
- misogyny being eroticized
- opulence marketed as something we "deserve"
- etc.

### Subjection

We have [marketing](/mr) and advertising agencies to thank for selling
us commodified happiness in forms of priced experiences in which we must invest
before mentally/emotionally cashing them in. Empire uses this, along
with fear, to subject us.

Interestingly, Empire also manages to wiggle its way through
[simple living](/simple-living) and say that a simple life is enough for
one to be happy. What this does is put a cap  on the possibilities of
life, of experiencing a wider range of emotions, by saying, "You should
be happy you're here." If that sounds good to you, that's alright. But
I'm checking out.

### Rigid radicalism

Rigid radicalism, while not exactly the opposite of joyful militancy,
shapes our [activism](/activism) so that the spaces and relationships we
are in become toxic towards the people in it. It comes in many forms:
the need to be better than others; the way we self-censor lest we get
canceled; etc.

Since rigid radicalism borrows ideals from the Empire and "requires"
them for revolution, it demands self-sacrifice, not for profit (that's
[capitalism](/capitalism)) but for the movement. I don't get the need
for self-sacrifice; it's a net negative for everyone. On the other hand,
seeking compromises offer better learning experience. If there's no room
for nuance and no space to wiggle, then I cannot dance in it---it's NOT
my revolution.

Not sticking to a monolithic ideology is liberating, mind you, but has
the drawback of being less sure on what actions to do or not do. Which
is *fine*---we are not wired to be cold and efficient. And anyway,
lasting change requires time. Our warm bodies allow us to fail forward
to a future where we all have more freedoms.

Look no further: rigid ideology is what isolates CPP-NDF-NPA from the
masses they seek to liberate. To be fair, by offering an alternative way
of living during Marcos Sr. Dictatorship, theirs was a movement that
sought to topple the oppressive regime, and that activists at the time
felt it was right to join the cause. But now, they have very little
affect.

## US Empire

This meme is not necessarily limited to the US, but it's surely its
defining characteristic.


According to sociologist Walden Bello, the political economy of US is
built on two "original sins":
1. Genocide of Indigenous Peoples of Americas; and
2. Use of slavery of African Americans to prop up US capitalism.

The US empire might begin its path to obsolescence once we, especially
the American settlers acknowledge and repair these two sins.

## Focus on military

Focusing on improving and mainly utilizing military security, according
to history, would be to the detriment of economy and political and
diplomatic relations with other states and societies. Militarism is a
highly hierarchical, highly organized implementation of [violence](/violence)
as a tool of state to impose its authority.

Authoritarian regimes almost always have the military at their disposal.
Such regimes tend to have higher poverty rates.
