We were recently invited to watch two one-act plays combined in one
showing called *Emulsyon*, produced by [Apothecary Productions](https://www.instagram.com/apothecaryproductions/) (Instagram).
As said, it contains two different stories attempting to traverse a
narrative exploring the aftereffects of Martial Law to its families.

## *Loyalist Redux*

By Kanakan Balintagos---Mother and son comes into view quarelling over
the politics that they believe in, and it gets personal. And we have
seen this before, maybe even remembered ourselves in it---parents
sitting in the opposite site of their kids' beliefs. But if either side
would be open to the idea of unpacking the conflict together, a
compromise might be achieved in which no bridges are burned.

## *Indigo Child*

By Rody Vera---The direction of play, for me, is more symbolic than
real, yet more visceral in its execution as it tackles the trauma that
state violence have caused against those that oppose the people in
power. State's monopoly of violence not only harms its victims but also
the communities around them.

## Watch *Emulsyon*

If you are able, see *Emulsyon* showing from 08 - 23 NOV 2024. Tickets: https://ticket2me.net/event/21941
