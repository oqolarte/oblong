Tools help us create.
Early humans use rocks and sticks to shape their spaces,
to gather food, to survive.
Today, our tools no longer have a primitive side to it.
In fact, we have made them so modern the average person can't make their
own from raw materials.
This is, of course, understandable;
given the economics of scale,
we have outsourced everything elsewhere.
Now, there are devices that can help create cool drawings and paintings.
Technology provides tools like drawing software, digital cameras, and
even 3D printers that artists can use to make their [art](/art).

But if tools are scarce, expensive, and/or hard to maintain,
it doesn't mean we can't create, does it?
Sometimes, in certain places, access to tools like computers
or high-tech gadgets can be hard.
And yet, art can still happen, as it always have,
not in spite of, but especially because of constrains.
While inaccessible tools hinder us from creating more,
it can lead to innovative solutions.

I see it as a challenge, then:
these limits can push me to come up with new ideas that I might not have
discovered otherwise.

## Simpler Art with Simpler Tools

One can create a wide range of art with simpler tools.
Here are some ideas:

1. Drawing and Sketching: With paper and pencil or pen one can
   experiment with different shading techniques and styles in their
   drawings.
2. Painting: Watercolor paints, acrylics, or even finger painting with
    tempera paints can produce vibrant artwork. You don't need fancy
    brushes; you can use everyday items like sponges or even your
    fingers.
3. Collage: Collect magazines, newspapers, or colorful paper scraps,
    and create collages by cutting and arranging them into interesting
    compositions.
4. Found Object Art: Gather objects you find outdoors or around your
    home, like leaves, twigs, shells, or bottle caps. Arrange them into
    sculptures or use them in your artwork.
5. Street Art: If you have access to public spaces, you can create art
    with chalk on sidewalks or walls (where allowed), adding color and
    creativity to your community.
6. Digital Art with Basic Tools: If you have access to a basic computer
    or smartphone, you can use free drawing apps or software to create
    digital art. A simple stylus or your finger can serve as a digital
    pen.
7. Shadow Art: Use your hands and a light source to create captivating
    shadow puppets and scenes on a wall or screen.
8. Nature Art: Make art using elements from nature like sand, rocks, or
    even mud. Beaches and forests can be your canvas.
9. Origami: Transform a simple sheet of paper into
    intricate sculptures through the art of origami.
10. Body Art: Use washable body paints or even markers to create
    temporary body art or face painting designs.

## Complex Art with Simpler Tools

Simpler tools can be used to create intricate art.
The complexity depends more on the creativity, skill,
and vision of the artist rather than the tools they use. Here's why:

- Technique: Even with basic tools like a pencil and paper, an artist
    can employ advanced techniques such as cross-hatching, stippling, or
    layering to create intricate and detailed drawings.
- Layering: Artists can achieve complexity by layering colors,
    textures, or shapes. This can be done with basic painting supplies
    like watercolors or acrylics.
- Precision: Artists can use fine motor skills to create intricate
    details, regardless of the simplicity of the tools. A steady hand
    and attention to detail can go a long way.
- Creativity: The imagination of the artist plays a huge role. You can
    use simple tools to create complex, thought-provoking, or
    emotionally charged art by exploring new concepts and ideas.
- Experimentation: Artists can push the boundaries of what's possible
    with any tool by experimenting and trying new things. This can lead
    to innovative and complex art forms.

- Who defines what art is?
- Art's complexity can't be the function of tools' complexity that
  created it, right?

- Art begets art. It can reflect but not resolve.


In the Philippine context, there's no one reason why we create what we
create. The desire to create is a natural impulse. This innate drive
allows us to express emotions, tell stories, explore imagination,
reflect on life, [connect with others](/communication), and leave a
legacy. But art in the Philippines is mostly mass produced for
consumption. Its purpose: decoration.

## Absurdity and Humor

Technology has greatly expanded the possibilities for creating humorous
art and sharing it with a wide audience.

Memes are funny and can be used to bring something to the surface.
Humor magnifies social issues. It's also a coping mechanism.

Art is a great avenue for humor to deliver big issues with a light
touch, making them more accessible and engaging.

- Many comic artists make web comics to highlight the modern day
  [absurdities](/surrealism) in a funny way.
- I wonder what software and hardware they use to make those? iPads?
  Adobe Suite?
- Who controls the tools controls the art.
- Tools and [technology](/technology) should liberate us from, not cage
  into, walled gardens and silos.
- Bad tech is a class issue.
- I am learning FOSS and repair so I am free to (re)make the stuff I
  want, to (re)share them however I want.

## Why use tech for art?

For thousands of years, we have been using technology to make art.
The latter, dare I say, is the result of the improvement of the former.
From cave wall paintings to trash-worthy NFTs (thank gods the hype is
over).

For me, I try to master the use of technology when I can so I can be
more efficient in making art.
But thinking about it,
that's probably the wrong way of doing it.
Well, there's really no right or wrong way.
What I meant was, art is meant to enjoyed.
If its creation is rushed,
what are the chances that people would enjoy in experiencing it?
I'd assume that it would be different than when art is thoughtfully,
mindfully crafted over a period of time.
