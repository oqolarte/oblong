## Dedication (?)

ACROSS ALL TIMES AND ALL WORLDS:
To past me who could not have imagined them;
to Isya here and now;
and to the blooming flora and fauna that *will* rise from the ruins of
Empire in the distant future and dimensions

## One-sentence pitch

A radical cook uses his own flesh as an ingredient to end Hunger.

## One-paragraph pitch

A cook with super-regeneration decides bands with his friends to open a
small diner in an effort to feed as many people in his community at an
affordable price. His mad idea is to offer himself, literally, as an
ingredient in the food, by cutting the bone and flesh (since it will
grow back anyway), [preserving it](/meat-preservation) in a way, and
then preparing meals. To scale their operations, they try to secure
funding from investors from within their social circles. In succeeding
operations, he discovers it's harder to keep this unorthodox way a
secret from people. If they were to build a future they want, how could
he cultivate trust among them while keeping his secret? He also notices
that his regeneration rate is getting longer depending on how severe and
frequent his wounds are, until it reaches a point that it's taking years
for him to heal.

  just so he could be able to help others through charity. It is not
