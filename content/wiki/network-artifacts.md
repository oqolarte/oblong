Network artifacts also belong to the yellow zone in the [Pyramid of Pain](/pyramid-of-pain), which means it is annoying for an
[attacker](/threat-actor) to do harm in the network.

Network artifacts can be any of the following:
- user-agent string
- [C2 information](/c2)
- URI patterns, followed by HTTP POST request

Network artifacts can be detected [using network protocol analyzers](/network-protocol-analyzer).
