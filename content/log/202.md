*Meanwhile, in daydreamland...*

The room I am in bursts into flames. Can't say my sweat saves my sanity.
Lucky me finds the latch of the fire exit in time to escape the
hell...into the sea, roaring waves waiting as I now free-fall.

My pyrotechnic home above and behind me, while the waters in front and
below me, the latter fast approaching. The blueness alerts me of my
capacity to swim: nil.
