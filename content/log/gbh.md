I remembered the Grand Boulevard Hotel along Roxas Boulevard.

It was a cousin's birthday,
and her father wanted to celebrate in a hotel.
Back then, as an 8-9 year-old,
I thought it was an exciting venue to be in.
Looking back at it now,
I think it was a waste of money.

I remember still that the building had a brutalist facade,
although I didn't know then what a brutalist design is,
nor did I appreciate it.
The building looked stiff enough in its greyness and roughness,
and that was it.

I remember the swimming pool to be in the third floor.

At one point,
one of the elevators stopped working.
I vaguely remember that it was my cousin's fault,
her being unneccessarily playful with the buttons.

The time then spoke highly of Nokia mobile phones
that had the game Snake 2 on them.
What a time.
