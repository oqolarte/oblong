## Start with an example

Consider the fence described by G. K. Chesterton:

> There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say,
> for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The
> more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, “I don’t
> see the use of this; let us clear it away.” To which the more
> intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: “If you don’t see
> the use of it, I certainly won’t let you clear it away. Go away and
> think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the
> use of it, I may allow you to destroy it."

If a fence exists, there's a reason for it.
Not necessarily a good or logical one,
but a reason nonetheless.

## To effect or not to effect change?

Before trying [to change existing systems](/revolution),
it's helpful to think about why it was put up in the first place.
Also ask what would be the consequence of the consequence
(second order, you might say)
of our actions, [attempts of intervention](/iatrogenics).

If action is inevitable, consider taking small steps. Small steps done
consistently are easier to reverse in case there is an unforeseen,
unwanted effect or mistake; and they are more likely to be adopted by those
affected.

[Uncertainty being a function of time](/chaos), we must take this into
consideration when planning for any action that would cause change. We
cannot predict the future, but we know for sure that it is full of
surprises that we don't know we don't know. Put
simply, allot for the largest wiggle room possible.
