Permaculture, or permanent agriculture, includes a set of
[design](/design) principles in managing land that mimics the
relationships of plants and animals as they are in the wild. This is
practiced as an alternative to the traditional monoculture agriculture,
which is known to drain the nutrients from the topsoil, as well as both
destructive and expensive to maintain.

This article is a message from indigenous leaders and organizations,
mainly critiquing regenerative agriculture and permaculture as
narrow solutions to the climate crisis.

The following bullets are my own notes.
I highly recommend to (re)read the whole article in the link above for more details.

- We are connected to Nature and it to us on a deep level.
It's not an external place nor entity which we must mimic.
- All matter and energy is alive and conscious,
and nothing is dead as it is believed in Western ideologies.
- It's not up to us whether a practice (e.g., tilling, mulch) is good or bad.
We can only maintain relationships of balance.
- [The words we speak shape the worlds we inhabit](/communication).
English language can never fully encompass the breadth and depth
of indigenous words when describing what they've been tending to for many, many
generations.
- [Healing of land must include healing of people](/social-ecology) and vice versa.
This means [knowing the history](/second-order-thinking) of the previous caretakers of the land and how
colonizers have inflicted generational trauma on both the people and the earth.
- Recognizing and healing all our own traumas will heal the land,
because we are tied to it, and it to us.
