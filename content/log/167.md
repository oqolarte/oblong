I've always been an angry person despite the timid fleshy shell. Getting
this emotion under control remains a challenge daily that not even yoga,
meditation, or just plain zoning out could fix.

The bad idea behind unloading the negative energy on an adversary is in
thinking that violence---physical, emotional, or some other
form---however justified (what even is?) can be leveraged to "get even".
In reality, it burns anything it touches. If I'm always trying to
level the field, what collateral damage, if any, am I avoiding? Even
when I'm answering that question for myself, it's hard; I'm almost never
kind to the man in the mirror.

If this rage sometimes encourage me to pray for the unalive status, I
mean it as a value statement, not a factual one. What I could have meant
is, I want this life to have less of the things that trigger it, to
ironically distance me a forest-fire away from the unwanted, unnecessary
suffering. I accept, of course, that this is wishful thinking.

It will always be a work in progress.
