My dream house aims to incorporate different [design](/design)
principles including the following:

- Tropical design
- [Permaculture](/permaculture)
- Sustainable [engineering](/engineering)
- Low [technology](/technology)

{{< toc >}}

## Where?

Hopefully in a rural city closer to nature but not too far from
civilization.

More things to consider:

- Traffic and/or car-dependence
- Air pollution
- Possible modes of transportation
- Crime rate
- Proximity to a fault line
- Proximity to sea
- Closer to forest

## Civil Works

- Polished [concrete](/concrete) for floors, but if possible, limit its use to
  house parts responsible for structural integrity like foundation,
  (some?) ground-floor walls
- clay bricks
- Perimeter walls with double walling; use reclaimed pallette
- Chamfered corners and edges for walls
- If two story or more high: High ceiling with mezzanine and/or loft
- Roof: rainwater collection system, solar panels; roof deck (optional), plants;
  hip or gable; vent turbine for ventilation
- window, accordion screen, sliding
- Garage: optional
- Baked bricks with slats where the sun wall is
- If bungalow: [Solar house with passive cooling](https://www.builditsolar.com/Projects/Cooling/passive_cooling.htm)
- NOT directly above fault line, within at least 5 meters, or at least
  10 for good measure
    - Check https://hazardhunter.georisk.gov.ph/map# for more details

## Architectural

Possible reference:
[250 things an architect should know](https://www.readingdesign.org/250-things)

### General space

Main entrance gate has a trellis with [differently colored]
bougainvillea climbing on it.

Skylights with patterns that will project interesting geometric shadows.
Might also have stained glass.

Foyer, small receiving area like Japanese (Genkan),
with small wooden bench and gravel bed

loft with safety net as lounge

Bedroom/s on mezzanine

2 t&b: one for GF, one for mezzanine, vertical aligned for
cost-efficient plumbing

Furniture: Beach recliner, but bench

A plot where we can grow our own food via [permaculture](/permaculture).

### Design ideas

Actual measurements/dimensions as painting, including line and [typography](/typography)?

### Kitchen

- counter top: formica or quartz; no granite
- faucet, long bendable neck, gate valve controlled by foot
- stainless [steel](/steel) sink one big and wide and deep, or two tubs,
- Rocket stove (if possible?)
- Cabinet doors and drawers with soft-close hinges,
and/or open cupboards to discourage uk-ok
- Emeco (or similar) chairs, or industrial-looking or -grade chairs;
or cantilever chairs
- Murphy table

### Doors

- Consider which doors should have automatic door closer
- with peep holes
- Mortise locksets where practical, made of brass or copper
- Main doors swing out (check if ok with code); viewing panel made of shatter-proof acrylic, with one-way film
- Sliding doors with auto closer
- Double action spring hinges on some doors
- Doorways wide enough to accommodate a person on wheelchair.

### Windows

- las ventanas de concha, or Capiz shell as lattice material
- stained glass in one of the rooms!
- window heights = 1100mm for effective indoor air movement
- Wind deflectors (?)
- Rain screens over windows
- floor-to-ceiling jalousie

### Furniture

- Bamboo chair
- Rattan pieces

## Plumbing

Solar thermal coil water heater, with insulated water tank

### Sources of [water](/water)

Cistern/s where rain water is collected

Pumps to draw groundwater from earth:

1. hand pump
1. Electric pump (solar-powered on/off grid hybrid)
1. gas-powered pump
1. wind mill

Water tank to gravity-feed the house in case of water outage.

Another tank/cistern to collect gray water from kitchen and laundry.

### Toilet & Bath

- well ventilated with bamboo slats from head level up to ceiling
- cobalt blue (or dark maroon) tiles (small squares or small hexagon)
- toilet, with liquid and solid flush, bidet
- Compost toilet (ecosan toilet by Unicef)
- Shower curtain made of Hemp
- Grey water waste management system
- Waterless urinal

## Electrical

- convenience outlets (CO) and their rigid steel conduits (RSC) installed atop the surface;
- height at 750-900mm from finished floor level (FFL).
- all COs are suitable for three-pronged plugs (properly grounded, of
  course), eliminating the need for adapters.
- each CO within 500mm of the sink, if any, should
    - have flip-cover; and/or
    - is a GFCI [ground-fault circuit interrupter] outlet
- light switches to be placed 1100-1200mm from FFL
- main power panel should be visible at all times.
    - circuit branches are properly labelled.
- each lighting fixture and CO are labeled (weatherproof label for
  outdoor fixtures) to which homerun (circuit branch) they belong. for
  future maintenance.
- lights in main areas (living area, dining area) to have a combination
  of daylight and soft white LEDs (white and yellow lights, respectively)
