Sometimes, I wonder about the effectivity of such violent direct
actions. As of writing this on Week 50 of 2024, it has been days since
the Brian Thompson, *former* CEO of UnitedHealthcare, was gunned downed
by someone now dubbed "The Adjuster." People online have been sharing
jokes, anecdotes, and memes on how this could be one of the greatest
performance art of our lives. (Days later, police arrested Luigi
Mangione, supposedly the assassin.) But by writing, or even thinking, about
such a polarizing idea, I don't mean to glorify merciless
[destruction](/destruction), especially for a [social revolution](/revolution).
The caustic ways of extremism---really,
terrorism---do not have a place in ensuring a just and inclusive world
for all beings in the world.

When people with anarchistic tendencies take to terrorism, it puts to
question the entire philosophical and political movement for universal
freedom. Even now, when people hear the term "anarchists," they
associate it with overall unruly violence. This is likely because of the
aforementioned propaganda of the deed that spiraled out of control on
late 19th century Europe.

If, however, the propaganda instead has attacked the ideas on which our
current systems of oppression stand, I wonder what would happen then. [Capitalism](/capitalism), [patriarchy](/patriarchy),
militarism, [fascism](/fascism), sexism---each receiving a hypothetical bomb (a
truth bomb?) with hopes of obliterating them.
For when we, as a collective conscious set of living and thinking and
minding beings, finally destroy these systems---or obsolete them, if one
is not fond of destroying---can we begin building worlds anew.
Destruction, viewed this way, then is the most important work, and the
hardest one at that.

To nourish the wants and needs of an individual so that they may
flourish and contribute to their community, the [collective](/community)
must [ensure that all of these basic necessities are met](/mutual-aid).
As "payment" the individual could create beautiful things for the world
to see.
