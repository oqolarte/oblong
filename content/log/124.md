- Updated [CV](/cv)

Since my last update,
I've been thinking of a few things.

## Shower Game Idea

Instead of Drinking Game,
which may not be for everyone,
I propose Shower Game.

The mechanics are simple:
- Wash your face each time you say "*Ang init!*"
- Take a shower each time you say "*Ang init!*" followed by an expletive.
- Open a fire hydrant each time you include "*Ang init!*" in a paragraph full of
  expletives.
- Dance in the rain if your rain dance did make it rain.

## Jempoy

In a recent small talk with a co-worker,
we went over my preferred mode of transportation,
the humblest single-speed bike,
more specifically, [my fixed-gear bike](/50).

My read of our conversation is,
he's both fascinated and spooked by the thought
of traversing the urban hellscape of Metro Manila
using a simple yet effective machine.

The term *jempoy*---a slang for errant, reckless cyclists---was
also thrown in the air.
I don't think he's implied I'm one[^fixie]
although I can almost feel that he might have dealt first hand with one
in the wild.

I reassured him that despite riding fixed,
I'm not a jempoy:
I wear a helmet,
I have foot retention,
and I have a brake.
On top of all that,
I follow traffic rules...
most of the time.
I'm such a snob,
that I don't even subscribe to the niche culture
among local fixie riders.

[^fixie]: In local cycling scenes, fixie riders like myself are sometimes branded as jempoys.

### Ride to Work

Still on the orbit of bicycles,
I get little praises at work when people find out
that I just ride my bike to work,
to which I often respond with,
"I'm lucky to live (relatively) nearby to be able to do this,"
or
"It's just around 5 km one way anyway, or around 30 mins."

Cycling offers me so much freedom in terms of urban mobility,
and I can only wish that many more able-bodied people join in the fun.

I understand their amazement,
because five or so years ago,
I wouldn't dare do that.

But so many things have changed since the Pandemic,
and lots of people have been radicalized.
One of the good things that came out of it is,
we now have more bike lanes in the Metro,
thanks to those radical cyclists who had demanded dedicated lanes
for cyclists.
