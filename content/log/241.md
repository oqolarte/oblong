## Brief review of *Resist Everything...*

It should be no news that it took me months after receiving it as a gift
from a friend abroad to get to finishing this book.

[Oscar Wilde](/oscar-wilde)---thanks to the scholarship of the author
Kristian Williams in his book ***Resist Everything Except Temptation***---is
shown to be a complex character from the Victorian era, one who was born
wealthy, yes, but had evolved into someone who saw the society and state
for what each of them are.

Most of the time, Williams lets Wilde tells his own story, but for such
a colorful life, I can't blame the author for inserting his political
insights when necessary to explain something.

### More reflections

It is Christmas season when I finished reading this book. People echo
that it's the time for giving, but I don't think they mean that it's the
*only* time. Personally, I think of when will I have the
means---courage, really--- to give "big" things, in terms of money, good
food, clothing, to people in need without going bankrupt myself. I know
this is a limited way of thinking about how we can help one another, but
we all deserve indulgence sometimes. Right now, it means having the
resources.

Meanwhile, when I come across the lives of "extreme minimalists," I
can't help but notice that many of them come from a place of privilege
who have decided that a life of excess is not worth having. While I'm
fascinated by their attempt at ascetism to the point where I ask myself
if I could ever do that lifestyle, I know there is a right balance
between indulging in life's pleasures and [living simply](/simple-living).
I'm of the opinion that when we expropriate the excesses of the ruling
class, decadence can be distributed equally so that everyone can
experience it periodically.

On that note, I wonder whether giving people the luxury versions of
basic necessities for only a limited amount of times would pacify them
or agitate them to demand better living conditions. There is much
discontent among the masses, that much we know. But feeling it is just
first step in [turning everything out of order](/revolution) to favor,
ultimately, our desires and dreams.

Money on its own is not evil. The evil part comes from the accumulation
of wealth, the consolidation of power, and the monopoly of violence by
those who have succeeded in doing so. Crimes exist because of these
imbalances that cause people to be dishonest and wish to harm others.
