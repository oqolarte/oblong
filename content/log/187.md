LUNCH TIME---food came in great and piping hot, and everyone was at
their places wolfing down meats and talking about business.

After eating, the next most obvious thing was to wash the oil with
coffee. And the leader of the band facilitated the informal discussion
with a few spicy questions that we were supposed to answer one by one.

But it didn't feel right when she, the leader, had to look at my
direction and point out that I'm quiet with an undertone that somehow
it's an undesirable trait. Honestly, it caught me off guard.

What I could've done (non-exhaustive list):
- Say firmly, "I'm a quiet person" and leave it at that. Or quickly add,
  if I'm looking for a fight that day, "---around people I don't like."
- Just say, "Yes."

What I did:
- *Nothing.*

If silence amplifies the anxiety of loud talkers, then I didn't want to
cause any more discomfort by escalating it.

I've been around people who have been genuinely concerned, though, when
I'm abnormally quiet. I can imagine that they're only worried I might be
upset or something wrong happened. To diffuse any worries in that
situation, I respond with "I'm fine" which may or may not be
true, but getting into it at that moment wouldn't solve anything.
