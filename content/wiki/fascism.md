Merriam-Webster [defines it as](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fascism):
> a political philosophy, movement, or regime
> (such as that of the Fascisti)
> that exalts nation and often race above the individual
> and that stands for a centralized autocratic government
> headed by a dictatorial leader,
> severe economic and social regimentation,
> and forcible suppression of opposition.

In short, it's an ideology that says certain types of people are
inferior.

## Describing what it is

Fascism is caused by a belief that power comes from the position of
leadership itself. For example, if someone is able to use force and
intimidation to get elected president of a country, then they're a
legitimate leader and should have all the power and respect that
position entails, and their leadership should be followed.

In extreme examples we see people in positions of leadership who exempt
themselves from the laws or change the laws after the fact to make their
past crimes legal. This behavior only makes sense if we think that
having the position of "president" gives the person the powers and
rights of the leader of the executive office *regardless of how the
achieved that position.*

A belief that it's the position that matters, and not the support of the
people, or the democratic process, etc. that matters, then that means
two things:
- Corrupt and immoral people will try and gain the position of
  leadership. It's more attractive to be the leader if you can erase
  past crimes and enrich yourself without consequences.
- Fascist leaders will need to continue to convince people to continue
  to accept them. This is where nationalism, segregation, and fear of
  outsiders are extremely useful. Putting social structures in place
  that entrench the existing leadership will eventually be the only way
  to hold on to power in a fascist government.

## Characteristics

3. People are rallied against a single common enemy:
