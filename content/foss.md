## Special Mentions

- [Fedora Workstation](https://getfedora.org/en/workstation/) -- The
  first Linux distro I used. GNOME desktop environment was easy to
  learn. But i3 tiling window manager made more sense to use.
- [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org/) -- The one I used in [the Old
  Computer Challenge](/old-computer)
- [Devuan 5 "Daedalus"](https://www.devuan.org/os/announce/daedalus-release-announce-2023-08-14)
  -- is a Debian-fork OS without systemd that used to be in my main
  computer before distro-hopping[^distro-hopping] to Alpine.
- [LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net) -- For a while, I had used this
  Firefox fork, but it was giving mild inconveniences in my new Alpine
  setup. So, I switched back to Firefox.
- [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org) -- For when I need to be
  anonymous on the internet. I don't use this much, but I have it just
  in case.
- [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/) - GUI email client I had used
  and is just reliable, though can be bloated at times.

[^distro-hopping]: The act of frequently changing the OS of one's
computer to a different distribution of
[Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux), *usually* as a hobby.

## Why?

As much as possible, I want to use FOSS (i.e., free and open source
software) for all my software needs. I believe FOSS empowers me to
accomplish digital tasks that don't cage me in a paid walled garden
and/or surveil my every move.

{{< figure src="/image/foss-venn.png" alt="Venn Diagram showing the intersection of 3 characteristics of a software: good, fair, legal. All three is what FOSS represents. Good and legal is usually privacy-invasive. Good and fair is piracy. Fair and legal software: 'Why are you using it?'" caption="Venn Diagram generator by classtools.net" >}}

It can be hard, though, especially if Big Tech companies
are embedded in our digital lives now (e.g., at work),
whether we like it or not.

I try not to get obsessed, though, on picking the right tools.
There's no perfect tool, and even the great ones will not save you;
how you use them might.
