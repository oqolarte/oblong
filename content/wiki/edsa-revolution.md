In February 1986, the Marcos family was unceremoniously flown to Hawaii
by the US government which installed the dictatorship for the longest
time.

Friend 1 muses:

> Why do Filipino activists insist on ["celebrating" EDSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_Power_Revolution)?
> It is a nominal revolution, at best.
> I think it sends a wrong message about harking on a glorified past,
> especially when that past "glory" has not worked for the common people.
> It is counter-progressive.
> 
> Besides, people can just look farther into the past and glorify Marcos' time instead,
> however insidious that might be.
> 
> I think we must come to terms with our past
> and not divide our history in terms of what and how the ruling class defines it:
> pre- and post-Martial Law.
> All that is in the past has led us to where we are now:
> degradation of living conditions,
> severe inequality
> and massive immisseration of everyday life.
> 
> It is political imagination of the future,
> and not nostalgia,
> that is powerful enough to change the present state of things.

Friend 2 resonates with his thoughts:

> [Why] would I celebrate a regime change?
> A victory for neoliberalism is not my victory.
> I will not welcome a new ruler.

Malaginoo echoes this in their essay
[*Blossoms of an Aborted Revolution*](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/malaginoo-blossoms-of-an-aborted-revolution)
through the POV of critics,
no matter the political leaning:

> [D]etractors vilify its failure of replacing the prevailing order,
> instead replacing old oligarchs with new ones.
> 
> [...]
> 
> [A]s the leftists woke up from their political accommodation—perhaps
> after shots were fired in Mendiola—it soon became apparent
> that EDSA didn’t topple a system,
> it merely changed the king (or rather queen), on the throne.
> 
> [...]
> 
> Simply, what we should take from EDSA is that regime change
> and replacing our presidents cannot bring about liberation.
> Liberation is the task of the oppressed and dispossessed alone.
