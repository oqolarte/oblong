Different ways of existing together and living in relative harmony are
already present in many communities all around the world. To gain sight
of them, we must be open, and
[actively look for empowering ways](/joyful-militancy),
that despite our differences, we can live
together.

## Living together with differences

What are we capable of doing individually? Collectively? We won't know
until we try and try again.

Privatized patriarchal nuclear family is an expensive way to live.
Sharing resources with the community always has been the norm in many
societies around the world. Research by anthropologists and sociologists
indicates that privatized units (e.g., families) are unhealthy for
everyone.

Even if, for some reason, you "hate other people," you don't
have to like or love everyone to be in community with them. Neighbors
can work still work together in, say, calamaties for better survival,
but it's not necessary to have dinner with them regularly.
And if we want to be more pedantic, a community can be as small as two
people who deeply care for each other.

Atomizing of spaces such that being an individual, or worse, being
alone, is highly preferred over socializing leaves many people
susceptible to emotional pain.

Selfishness causes relationships (including romantic ones) fail.
It might also be the
cause why other relationships with communities fail. When we only think
of ourselves, society crumbles. One way to reverse this is
[to be generous in sharing what we have.](/mutual-aid)

It won't be easy, reintegrating "back to our communities."
People naturally have different experiences
that may clash with other perspectives. Working well within the
community means working with these differences, facing them head on
whenever possible instead of avoiding them altogether. This means a lot
meeting halfway, and a lot of making compromises between all parties
involved.

It's okay to not have good relationships with everyone. We are trying to
avoid the simplistic hegemony applied to us by Empire. It's important to
have conflict with others and possibly learn from all the ways we can
resolve them in the spaces we inhabit.

To make meaningful compromises that empower those affected,
it's helpful for oneself to be open to a myriad of experiences and
different perspectives. If it's in one's capacity to try everything at
least once, then one should do it. One of the main reasons why people
don't like compromises is because of fear. Perhaps, by living fully
might we slowly chip away at our fears, and/or use them as tools with
which we can strengthen our [relationships](/friendship).

### "But I don't need anyone!"

Yes, you do. I do.
**I** am already a crowd because my life already
depends on others.

No one really grows old alone. Whether we like it or not, our lives are interconnected. Not just in the familial sense, but also in the sociopolitical sense: we need, say, farmers, laborers, and workers who make this society functional daily.

Autonomy, though, is not to be confused with independence.

Can individuals make a difference? Together we can, in a way that
matters, in and for our communities---volunteer, [teach](/pedagogy), pick up
trash if it isn't in a bin, etc. While we must [gradually] accept that
these things might not be enough to stop or slow the broader
[collapse](/collapse), random acts of kindness matter for the person
(both humans and non-humans) and plants that you helped to overcome an
obstacle. In fact, kindness can be a form of disobedience, one that
subverts the ideals of [capitalism](/capitalism), of [nationalism](/nationalism), of [fascism](/fascism), of
militarism, and of sexism; and anyone can be kind!

Neoliberal individualism "empowers" a person to be responsible for their
own success, to keep themselves healthy mentally, physically, and
emotionally. In reality, Empire [markets](/mr) this individualism as
"empowering" and of course we latch onto this so-called powers granted
to us, because it only makes us dependent on its systems. It strips away
our ability to imagine for collective alternatives.

Always doubt anyone who thinks they don't need other people to live.
They might have anti-social and/or sociopathic tendencies. Living alone,
by oneself, is literally impossible.

## Past and future communities

Consider: we may have affected both our ancestors and our descendants by
existing now. On one hand, the former had thought about our welfare and
acter accordingly; on another, we could be doing the same for the
latter. Community work, then, like many [revolutionary](/revolution) acts, spans generations.

## A few things about far-right communities

On his book *Global Battlefields*, Walden Bello talks about how Marine
Le Pen led the French far-right National Front party by hijacking
deglobalization and mixing it with nationalist and Islamophobic---in
short, fascistic---spins. Bello pointed out that this is the wrong kind
of community-building, and wrote:

> For the right, community is determined by race, ethnicity, and blood.
> It is narrow in terms of who is included in it rather than expansive.
> For us, community is principally a matter of shared values that
> transcend differences in blood, gender, race, class, and [culture](/culture).
> Community tends toward continual expansion and incorporation of people
> that share the same values...
