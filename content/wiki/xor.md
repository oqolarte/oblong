XOR can be translated as toggle on/off, which will either exclude (if
exists) or include (if nonexistent) the specified bits.

A bitwise XOR(^) is a binary operation that takes 2 bit patterns of
equal length and performs logical exclusive OR on each pair of
corresponding bits.

E.g.:

```
    0101 (decimal 5)
XOR 0011 (decimal 3)
  = 0110 (decimal 6)
```
