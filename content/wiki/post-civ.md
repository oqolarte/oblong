Post-civilized thought[^tal-postciv] is based on three premises:

1. This civilization is, from its foundation, unsustainable. In this
   context, civilization means the entirety of the modern world's
   organizational structures, including legal and societal codes that
   determine what should and should not be existing, physically,
   emotionally, digitally, spiritually, etc. It probably cannot be
   salvaged, and, whatâ€™s more, it would be undesirable to do so.
2. It is neither possible nor desirable to return to a pre-civilized state of
   being. Post-civ is *not* [primitivism](/primitivism). While some
   forms of [technology](/technology) do cause harm, it would cause more
   damage to reject it as a whole. It's more helpful to reject the
   *inappropriate* use of tech.
3. It's therefore desirable to imagine and enact a post-civilized
   [culture](/culture). Think of it as [repair](/repair), but for everything,
   including ideas. It doesn't necessarily mean wishing for
   [collapse](/collapse), but when it comes, either in One Big Event or
   in a slow steady march, the skills we learned and the communities we
   build along the way will help us be more joyful than we could ever
   be.
