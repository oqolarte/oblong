**Because there's no creative way to title this post.**

- Added new sections in [Server]({{< ref "/project/server.md" >}}).
Yes, kids, it's happening.
Or at least, bit by bit, I'm getting into it---
my homebrewed server is coming along.
- Added some lines and a footnote in the [Site]({{< ref "/project/site.md" >}}) about Pandoc.
An image is also removed.

## And now, the news

After I changed the DNS for this site, something went off:
the site goes down every update, only to go back up in a few hours.
I'll be fiddling still with my DNS registrar, but it is what it is for the moment.

Some time this week, the news of 7,000+ new COVID cases got many people alarmed.
As of this writing, we are yet again, in a lockdown.
I think they are calling this either "soft MECQ" or a "hard GCQ."
One meme thinks this is "poor governance" and I tend to agree.

I try to limit my errands outdoors.
Honestly, it's not hard to stay put.
With both the pandemic and the sun still wreaking havoc, I'm inclined to not venture away from home.

Special thanks to the newly installed *Diablo 2: Lord of Destruction* game running atop Wine[^wine].
So much nostalgia.
Running through the game with a Fire Druid build, if that matters to anyone.
Free time made me install the game, but I'm only partly to blame.

As for my body, I'm fully recovered now[^pain].
I must remember to do warm-ups and cool-downs before and after workout respectively.

[^pain]: Muscle pains had afflicted my thighs for days when I attempted to do pistol squats without properly learning the technique.

During the recovery, though, I did have breakouts.
It's a spell, I think, activated at the time of lethargy.
My body reminds me that it didn't evolve through millenia of struggle just to slouch indoors.
But I'm only partly to blame.


[^wine]: Wine ("Wine Is Not an Emulator") is a compatibility layer capable of running Windows applications on several POSIX-compliant operating systems, such as Debian, the one in my machine right now.
