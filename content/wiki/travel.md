We know there is much to see and experience with all our senses. The
places with interesting things are usually not Here. Sometimes, they are
not even in the Now.

This search for novelty and escape from the
[mundane activities of daily life](/simple-living) compel people to travel to
(relatively) distant places.

Traveling nowadays comes with a cost: financial, social, environmental.
If I want to go somewhere, I need to plan how my [in]actions might
affect the destination.

Fernando Pessoa writes in one of his entries in *The Book of Disquiet*:

> Travel is for those who cannot feel. That's why travel books are
> always so unsatisfying as books of experience.

A bold claim!

Pessoa explores why we do need to travel when there are infinite worlds
within us. I would agree, if it weren't for the fact that not all people
can have healthy imaginations with which to construct virtual places to
visit.
