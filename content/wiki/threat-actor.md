A **threat actor** is any person or group who presents a
[security risk](/security).
This broad definition refers to people inside and
outside an organization. It also includes individuals who intentionally
pose a threat, and those that accidentally put assets at risk.
They use attack vectors, which are pathways to penetrate security
defenses, to exploit vulnerabilities and exposures.

## Categories

Threat actors are normally divided into five categories based on their
motivations:

- Competitors refers to rival companies who pose a threat because they
  might benefit from leaked information.
- State actors are government intelligence agencies.
- Criminal syndicates refer to organized groups of people who make money
  from criminal activity.
- Insider threats can be any individual who has or had authorized access
  to an organization’s resources. This includes employees who
  accidentally compromise assets or individuals who purposefully put
  them at risk for their own benefit.
- Shadow IT refers to individuals who use technologies that lack IT
  governance. A common example is when an employee uses their personal
  email to send work-related communications.

## Advanced persistent threats

An advanced persistent threat (APT) refers to instances when a threat
actor maintains unauthorized access to (or "sticks around") a system for
an extended period of time. The term is mostly associated with nation
states and state-sponsored actors. Typically, an APT is concerned with
surveilling a target to gather information. They then use the intel to
manipulate government, defense, financial, and telecom services.

Just because the term is associated with state actors does not mean that
private businesses are safe from APTs. These kinds of threat actors are
stealthy because hacking into another government agency or utility is
costly and time consuming. APTs will often target private organizations
first as a step towards gaining access to larger entities.

## Access points

Each threat actor has a unique motivation for targeting an
organization's assets. Keeping them out takes more than knowing their
intentions and capabilities. It’s also important to recognize the types
of attack vectors they’ll use:

- Direct access, referring to instances when they have physical access
  to a system
- Removable media, which includes portable hardware, like USB flash
  drives
- Social media platforms that are used for communication and content
  sharing
- Email, including both personal and business accounts
- Wireless networks on premises
- [Cloud services](/cloud-computing) usually provided by third-party
  organizations
- Supply chains like third-party vendors that can present a backdoor
  into systems
- [IMSI-catchers](/imsi-catcher) to eavesdrop on nearby mobile phone
  traffic.

help you determine which access points they might target and what
ultimate goals they could have.
