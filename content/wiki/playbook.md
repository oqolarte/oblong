A playbook, in the context of [cybersecurity](/cybersecurity), is a
manual that provides details about any operational action, such as how
to respond to a [security](/security) incident.

## Forensic Case

When working on a forensic case, there are two playbooks you might follow:
1. **Chain of custody** playbook outlines the processes needed to
   document evidence possession and control during an incident
   lifecycle. This allows all parties involved to know exactly where the
   evidence is at all times.
2. **Protecting and preserving evidence** playbook outlines the processf
   properly working with fragile and volatile digital evidence. It
   likely has **order of volatility**, which is a sequence outlining the
   order of data that must be preserved from first to last. It
   prioritizes volatile data, which is data that may be lost if the
   device in question powers off, regardless of the reason.
