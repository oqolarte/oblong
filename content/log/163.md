## Apple Vision Pro

Apparently, Apple Vision Pro is out now, but I'm not sure if it's
already available here in the country as of writing this. Tech Youtuber
Marques Brownlee (AKA MKBHD) recently release a series of videos
reviewing Apple's overpriced version of a virtual reality headset.

My bias against Apple has me asking, "How [repairable](/repair) is it?"

iFixit [published an article](https://www.ifixit.com/News/89360/apples-vision-pro-will-almost-certainly-not-be-repairable-or-even-openable) back in Jan 2024
about the device's repairability, and to summarize, the author was very
skeptical about it.

## Words I looked up

This is inspired by [Tracy Durnell's Weeknotes](https://tracydurnell.com/2024/02/02/weeknotes-jan-27-feb-2-2024/) in which she has a section with the same name.

In my version, I'll try to use each word in a sentence (*o pangungusap
kung Tagalog*).

**temerity**
: excessive boldness

Use in a sentence (UIAS): "I blame our State's temerity to make no
effort in keeping you well-fed here, Mr. and Mrs. P, so much so for you
to uproot your life here in search for a better one there; it won't be
easy, so might as well give them hell as soon you've found your
footing."

**repudiated**
: disowned

UIAS: "The choice to live is rather anti-climactic; for some, it's
repudiated the moment something in them clicks, an idea that now makes
perfect sense."

**nadadalumat**
: kinakayang mag-isip nang malalim

Gamitin sa pangungusap: "Sa kakaibang panaginip ko lang nadadalumat ang
posibilidad na kaya ni Moo na upakan ang maitim na budhi ni Zed-zed."

**obdurate**
: hardhearted

UIAS: "Zed-zed remains obdurate on keeping Moo unbothered for at least
one whole hour!"

**effrontery**
: shameless audacity

UIAS: "My effrontery thus far has had you invested sans thy consent
about my spiels on Moo and Zed-zed, but deep inside, you *do* care,
because they are cats."
