## Party!

I've been thinking of---sadly, not being in---parties. Partying hard is
ultimately subjective. To me, partying should be jovial and inclusive,
and is in itself a resistance to opulence and materialism. If you cannot
make your party happen without consuming excessive amounts of resources,
*and* if the unused resources would be wasted away after the event, then
I don't want to be in it. Please don't invite me!

## *The Legend of Korra: Change*

Just finished watching the whole series, and honestly it leaves a lot to
be desired. But this is not a review of the series as a whole, but
rather a comment on *Book 3: Change*, specifically on the character of
Zaheer, the season's protagonist. Spoilers ahead.

Zaheer and his merry band of Red Lotus claim that they are anarchists,
in that they are anti-authority and dream of liberation for all. They
are the direct-action, non-consensus, [violent](/violence) kind, and
they are not my comrades. His revolution could never succeed because he
forced the Earth Kingdom into a state for which the people haven't
really prepared. "Removing [the Earth Queen] from office" (i.e., killing
her) only created a power vacuum, and power-hungry folks rushed in
to fill the void. Genuine anarchists would have understood that power
vacuums are a thing.

That doesn't mean Zaheer isn't relatable, *ofc* he is! I'd be lying if I
say I didn't dream of deposing a tyrant via violent vehicles. But the freedom
he desires for all cannot be achieved in an instant, not even in one
lifetime. In the universe of *Avatar*, even the Avatars have trouble "keeping
balance" for thousands of years.
It takes time to build [communities](/community) that would no
longer be dependent on [Empire](/empire).
