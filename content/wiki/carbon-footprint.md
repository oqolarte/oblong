Don't get obsessed with keeping your carbon footprint as low as possible
as doing so won't be good for your mental and physical health. Companies
invented the personal carbon footprint as a propaganda tool.

['Carbon Footprint was coined by Big Oil to blame you for climate change,](https://interestingengineering.com/culture/carbon-footprint-coined-by-big-oil-to-blame-you-for-climate-change),
putting the onus on you as an individual to change, instead of them.
