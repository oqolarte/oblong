- Added BPI QR code as a means to [Support](/support) me if you're from
  around here.
- Added six new entries and one new one-liner to [Imbentori](/imbentori).
- Added new project: [Daily Photos - Feb 2022](/feb2022-photos). It's my attempt
  to be more visually creative, at least for a month.

After a few months of semi-regular viewing,
we've finished watching *Mr. Robot* series.

It's a lot to take in.
As with most series we consume,
we try not to binge-watch it,
and try to process each episode.

Personally, I also try to watch one series at any given time.
This is especially a good thing to do, in my opinion, for *Mr. Robot*,
because it deals with heavy topics.
And I don't want to muddy my thinking by watching other series
alongside it.

All in all, it's a great series---mind-bending as a
techno-thriller should!
