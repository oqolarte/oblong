Privacy is a human right. I'm not doing anything illegal, and yet I have
curtains installed on our windows, and I close and lock the door of the
toilet and bath when I do *things* inside---because the public doesn't
need to know what I do at privacy of my own space.

With the convenience brought about by [technology](/technology), more
and more people are foregoing their privacy, both digital and physical.

When it comes to our data, we should be deliberate on how we handle it,
where and how we hand it over to people and/or services, where it's
stored, and that we understand where it's stored.
