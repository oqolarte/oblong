[People have been expressing themselves](/communication) through the clothes they wear
for many, many millenia now.

I hope I'm not too late to this,
so I'm compiling any fit inspos that I find.

## Yemeni Fashion

Women in Hadramaut, Yemen wear an all black abaya
and a conical straw sunhat called *madhalla*
when working in the fields.
What they're wearing is old yet effective solarpunk solution to the hot
weather.

A madhalla is made from plaited strips of date palm leaves,
and the high peak promotes air circulation inside the hat.

The black color of the abaya actually keeps them cooler
by absorbing heat before it reaches the skin.
The thickness of the fabric helps:
the outer layer does get hotter,
but the heat doesn't get transmitted to the skin.
