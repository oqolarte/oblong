Shitposting and nightblogging are terms whose meaning I first found in Tumblr.
Specifically in this [post](https://uppercasesmileyface.com/post/126760632305/honeywaspkittenbaby-upthawolfs/amp).
In summary:
Nightblogging is Surrealism[^surreal];
Shitposting is Dada[^dada].

[^surreal]: [Surrealism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealism) "[depicts]
  unnerving, illogical scenes [...] to allow the unconscious mind to express
  itself", to "resolve the previously contradictory conditions of dream and
  reality into an absolute reality,
  a super-reality."
[^dada]: [Dada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dada) "[rejects] the logic, reason,
  and aestheticism of modern capitalist society,
  instead expressing nonsense, irrationality, and anti-bourgeois protest."


For years, I did shitpost, because at the time it made sense.
Not making sense made sense, I mean, in the current crises that we're in.

For years, I also nightblogged, sharing pseudo-intellectual musings to strangers
of similar wavelength.

In fact, I'll do both here in this post:

**Shitpost**
: *A void is a must try at all cost.*

**Nightblog**
: *It's odd that I like some skin more so than others.*

The title of this post is inspired by a browser extension for Tumblr from wayback when.
Power users would have [Missing e](https://missing-e.tumblr.com),
because Tumblr had---and, I think,
still has---been making poor UI/UX design choices.
Missing e put back the features that the @staff removed,
and/or placed something that would drastically improve the blogging experience.

For years, I had been on that site,
more than any other social networking platforms.
I didn't like the shortness and urgency of Twitter,
although people leveraged the 140-char limit at the time
to produce witty and digestible sound bites.
Nor did I like Facebook,
for the sole reason that people there know me.
I couldn't have them not care about my shitposts and nightblogs.

I saw the balance I needed in Tumblr.

Anyway, below are "reblogs" from a few Tumblr users.
Which one is a shitpost?
Which one is a nightblog?
Can either be both?
Or is each neither?

From [vernon](https://post-wars.tumblr.com/post/680303963701149696):
> The Filipino word *papak* is very specific, ano?
> I don’t know if other languages also have a term for eating without rice.
> The Japanese has the synecdoche 御飯 (gohan)
> while Korean and Bahasa have 밥 (bap) and *nasi* respectively,
> but how do we say we eat a meal without the essential component of it that makes it a meal in our cultures?
> The invite-question 밥 먹었 니?
> (have you eaten?)
> may mean different if we take out the 밥 component,
> implying either a snacktime or that, perhaps, they are what we would say, *pumapapak*.
> “A meal is not a meal without rice”
> is something a person from Maritime Southeast Asia would say.
> What will you *goreng* if there’s no *nasi* in nasi goreng?
> Maybe *mie*?
> But is *mie* goreng a *meal* meal?
> Put in a cup of rice.
> Indonesians and Filipinos would gladly eat carbs with carbs.
> 
> Makan.

From [jncos](http://jncos.tumblr.com/post/169958561206/three-men-met-upon-the-luncheon-table-and):

> Three men met upon the luncheon table and discussed what they were going to eat for their meal.
> 
> The youth said “*I will use some money to order an avocado using an app on my phone, for although it is pricey I find this to be both efficient and delicious.*"
> 
> The scientist said “*I will order some Soylent using my cryptocurrency, for although this is even more pricey and disgusting from both a taste and conceptual standpoint I believe you will find this to be even more efficient that ordering an avocado.*”
> 
> The master clapped his hands and recited: “*My jaws are now open/ my gullet is red. From the wise mother owl/ I shall always stay fed.*” and opened his mouth towards the sky. The others beheld this and understood the true way.
