- Added a finished book in the [list](/books)

## Brief review of *Filipino Value System*

*Filipino Value System* is a dense research book by Filipino
anthropologist F. Landa Jocano. In my opinion, it's a good
anthropological report on [Filipino values](/filipino-values) and how
the research examines each positively, while still being grounded by
real life examples. It also includes insights from respondents that the
author has interviewed in this decades-long study. With topics
synthesized clearly and concisely, it becomes, like I said, a dense book
that in my opinion is a must-read of Filipinos and Filipinx diaspora who
might be questioning their identity.

## Embrace the barbell

When taking in information from the world, why not "embrace the
barbell"? That is, choose the very short or very long formats.

This was an idea proposed by Millie Tran in [her entry for Predictions for Journalism 2025](https://www.niemanlab.org/2024/12/embrace-the-barbell/). She said, "It's time to abandon middling stories..."

I'd like to explore this proposition but I want to go outside of
journalism and to the wider arena of...information.

I'm thinking memes for the very short format, and books (both fiction
and non-fiction, preferably printed ones) for the very long. I guess
articles, essays, and blog posts would fall somewhere in the middle...
but I won't---can't---abandon them; just *maybe* deprioritized.

We already started a meme group chat in which we would drop only memes.

As for the books, my personal target is to just read more than I did
last year (10 books for 2024). I already finished two this month of Jan
2025.

## Music

For the month of Jan 2025, I managed to only listen to one album,
because like I said, I'm giving more time to reading books. That means
listening to muzak has been put on the side.

| Album Name           | Artist        |
|----------------------|---------------|
| HIT ME HARD AND SOFT | Billie Eilish |

A good album to start the year, nonetheless.
