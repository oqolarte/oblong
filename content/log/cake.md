- Added a way for readers (are there any?) to support me, found in this page: [Support](/support/) (via Liberapay).
To be as less obnoxious about it as possible, this link will only be at the end of each Project page.
- Changed my email address in the Index.
After getting a domain from [Epik's](https://www.epik.com) registrar and setting up an email server with [Migadu](https://www.migadu.com), I now have a custom email address.
In the future, I will also set one up for Isya.
In the meantime, please send your mails to my new address.
- Also in Index, edited a few lines.

Today, our neighbors gifted us with plenty of food. 

One gave a tofu-version of sisig.
This lady was delighted to know that too I'm a tofu fan.

Another neighbor brought us *two* different servings of food:
chocolate cake and macaroni fruit salad.
The latter we found weird---who adds macaroni in fruit salads?

The cake---the cake is a lie.
Good thing that Isya first inspected it before eating a slice.
The cake is full of maggots.

We had to throw it out, and by that I mean send it to the compost bin.
Give it one last purpose, at least.

Now, that we've been primed to desire a chocolate cake, ordering one, maggot-free, was the next most logical step.
