September's tail end was packed, and a non-trivial
part of it was spent helping victims of police brutality and steering as
much people as we could away from copaganda.

## Direct action despite state propaganda

As might be expected of major media, there has been almost no coverage of what
happened in asymmetric [violence](/violence) that police agents deployed against
the Mendiola crowd last 21 SEP 2025---some of whom were merely passing by
and not "rioting."

You would not believe it, but Rolling Stone Philippines published a decent
coverage on the incident---I know I did not, not right away at least. Read: "[Why the ‘Mendiola 216’ Police Detention is Fueling Anger Over Human Rights Violations](https://rollingstonephilippines.com/state-of-affairs/philippine-politics/mendiola-detainees-police-abuse-lawyer/)"

You would not believe that Vera Files published a copjacketing
article---I did not expect that either. Read: "[Thugs disrupt anti-corruption protest in Mendiola](https://verafiles.org/articles/thugs-disrupt-anti-corruption-protest-in-mendiola)"
[Archived version](https://web.archive.org/web/20250922113546/https://verafiles.org/articles/thugs-disrupt-anti-corruption-protest-in-mendiola),
in case they changed their mind)

This burst of busyness nudged me out of my chill-osophizing and
funemployment into the grueling work of non-prophet with a tight-knit
of friends. We are slowly making progress.
