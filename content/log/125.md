## "How Are You Doing?"

I've read some interesting possible responses to this question that's
not necessarily mechanical, and still encapsulates my honest feeling
most days these days.

- "Same soup, reheated."
- "Rearranging deck chairs of the Titanic."
- "Hanging in there."
- "I'm out of bed and not crying."
- "Just like this."
- "I'm doing."
- "I don't know yet, it's still early."

That's to say,
I'm teetering between a spectrum of emotions,
as many of us are now.
I think it happens because the mind is much tethered to the flesh.
And the flesh---well, it's hard to keep it in check
when it decides to seek something it doesn't have.

## Music

Like I promised,
in terms of music album-consuming,
I am now focusing on one album per week.
Despite this significant reduction from [March](/122),
it did make me appreciate each of them more.

A week, indeed, is enough of a window to assess my feelings toward a particular a
body of work.

Last April, these albums were:

| Album Name                   | Artist      |
|------------------------------|-------------|
| Everything Was Forever       | Sea Power   |
| 平庸之上 = Beyond Mediocrity | 9m88        |
| Reinventing Axl Rose         | Against Me! |
| Dedicated to Bobby Jameson   | Ariel Pink  |


You know a song is great when one sings the riffs.
Unfortunately, I haven't found such a song in any of these albums,
but that's not to say I didn't find them good.
They all are, by the way, in their own quirky, gritty ways.
I'd definitely recommend them to those looking for new music to add to
their playlists.
