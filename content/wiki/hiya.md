*Hiya* is a dominant norm that guides how a person must behave in
relation with others to prevent unwanted conflict or shame. It's common
wisdom to [gut-feel](/damdamin) a situationer with hiya.

The notion of hiya includes different levels of emotions in
relationships:
- *atubili* (reluctance, unwillingness) - is holding back to assess first
  whether or acting (or not) is the right course.
- *alinlangan* (doubt, hesitation) - more than hesitation, implies subtle
  consideration of other people's feelings before doing anything.
- *alapaap ng kalooban* (uncertainty, vagueness) - is the etiquette of
  indirect communication, usually employed as courtesy of not being
  frank.
- *ngimi/pangingimi* (shyness) - is similar to stage-fright in terms of
  how this feeling can make a person numb and not act.
