- Changed one minor detail where our north is, in [Here](/here).

As cringey as it sounds,
never think blogging as complete without a blogger's review of
an out-of-town destination.

In this post,
I'm going to give my thoughts on
Las Casas Filipinas de Acuzar in Bagac, Bataan.
All expenses paid by my employer in the guise of company outing.

## First Impressions
For a tourist destination with a hefty price,
it's not looking good.
Literally.

The unpaved road leading to the compound lends for a bumpy ride.
It isn't too farfetched to think that this becomes worse with puddles if/when
it's raining.
Definitely not for most people.
Maybe this, too, is intended as part of
the 19th century feel of Old Manila?

Check-in is meh.
Many of the reviews in the internet seem
to think it's bad, though.
Maybe we're just lucky that day,
or maybe I had already lowered my expectations at that point.

## Facilities
When we reach our rooms,
we're promised to have our own toiletries,
pairs of slippers,
and at least one bottle of water per person.

When we got in,
we discovered there were no towels,
no slippers,
and no bottles of water.
We had to call the reception for towels and water multiple times.
The split-type aircon unit leaked,
creating an unpleasant puddle.
Supposedly there's a water heater,
but all we got was cold shower.
There's an electric kettle,
but I'm sure they don't expect us to use that
as our water heater, right?
Right??

All roads are made of cobblestone.
Depending on one's preference,
it may or may not be okay to walk on.

Some modes of getting around include:
- tram that runs as fast a walking person;
- calesa
- jeepney

To my knowledge, only the tram is free of charge.

There's a mythical bike rental shop,
but I never got around to locating it,
nor did I have the energy to even cycle around knowing I would
roll on uneven roads.

## Food

Buffet food, not good.
Most were bland:
pieces of meat with uneventful releases unsavory liquid when bitten.

It's like seasoning was never part of the menu.
Only the speculative feeling of taste that I had to imagine,
just so I could finish the food,
and honor the lives that were sacrificed to feed me.

## Beach

The sea did look inviting,
in spite of the grey sand one has to cross first
before reaching the saltwater.
This one definitely felt better than the shores
of [Calatagan](/calatagan)---smooth sand sans jagged stones.

Naturally, we played the waves,
even dared chasing them.
The waves were game.
It was only when the sun was setting when the waves were getting
larger and increasingly frequent---as
if to push us back to the shore.

## Miscellaneous

There's a pool area,
which I don't recommend,
simply because the beach must be the obvious choice
of body of water for one to swim in.

They offered a walking tour
where the guide would invite the guests to go inside
at least three of the old houses,
which I had no interest in participating,
because they timed it during the hottest part of the day.

## Verdict

Only go there someone who's net worth
is at least five times as much as yours sponsors your trip.
Don't spend your own hard-earned money
to spend even a day there.
There are better places to be in!
