Recently, I was an audience in a hearing. It was my first time being in
an actual courtroom. Let's just say that lawyering definitely is not for
me. As someone trained in STEM with a knack for [writing](/writing) as a
creative outlet, it's interesting to witness how lawyers present
arguments "formally" but with a dash of sleaze that I can't explain. It's
like the lawyering revolves around searching for inventive ways to skirt
around the truth. And, I guess, the trick is in knowing what truth is
there around which needs skirting.

I feel like there are too many wasteful motions, verbal circus, and
other ceremonies that can be omitted to expedite legal proceedings, but
that's my naive take on it.

Obviously, I can't share much details, except the courtroom looks and
feels large and intimidating. Wooden, polished slats line the walls, and
on them, the portraits of previous justices, their presence intentional.
The wooden oval emblem of the court reminds us of where the case is
currently at. The curtains that drape around it seems to have not been
taken down and washed for a while, and underneath the layers of
accumulated dust, they would have been pristine white and fresh fish
flesh pink.

Around the courthouse, more injustices---not necessarily in the form of
physical violence, but they do exist as such, especially when no one is
looking or squinting hard enough. It's in the way the sidewalks are jagged and
unwelcoming to pedestrians, possibly looking for work; how respect and
basic human decency can be demanded by people in black robes but not by
everyone else. I dropped a few coins in the rack of a saxophone player
I found busking on the way there and wondered if I should have given
more.
