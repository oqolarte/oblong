It took me three decades to get my first tattoo, and I'm proud to have
waited that long before getting one. I feel like this was the right time
to have it. I may or may not post a picture of it online, but I can
describe it for you:

It's a black cat, patterned to our very own resident black cat,
wearing the petals of rafflesia leonardi around its
neck. A decorative oval frames the feline with the forelegs
stretching outside the frame.

Now, I don't know if I'll get more tattoos... but I do have a spread in
my journal dedicated to some ideas.
