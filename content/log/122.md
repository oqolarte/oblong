March 2023 was an okay month for me.
The first half I spent alone and in the coziness of bold, cold bedroom.
The second half I have spent with the warm body that is my partner.

## Music Albums

Below is a list of albums I completed this month.
A lot of them is *meh*, which to be honest, is an unfair judgment,
knowing that I only listened to each once,
and only in the background while I'm doing something,
usually Work.

Will this be a monthly tradition? I don't know.

## How to Listen to an Album

A friend found it odd when I told them that I go through,
on current average,
one album a day.
They said (non-verbatim) that shit isn't sustainable.
No one could possibly process and/or enjoy an album on that rate.
And they have a point.

Part of my coping mechanism while at work
is to have music playing in the background.
This tactic, while it softens the impact of dread of work,
sacrifices the aesthetics imbued by the artist
when they compiled their music into an album.
I have reduced their work to ambience instead of it being my main focus.

To atone for my sins,
I will try to limit my rate of consumption to one album per week,
but I could listen to it daily, capped at once per day.
I will try to be present in at least one of the sittings
to enjoy the textures of sounds, the nuances of harmony,
and all that good (and bad)shite.
