Dada “[rejects] the logic, reason, and aestheticism
of modern capitalist society,
instead expressing nonsense, irrationality,
and anti-bourgeois protest,”
compared to [surrealism](/surrealism),
which has more real elements, but still incorporates
dream-like aesthetics.

I personally don't know the whole Reality, but with the lens of
[neo]Dadaism, some parts of it I can wade through without having to rely
on what is the objective truth. Sometimes, not making sense make sense
in this world full of absurd possibilities. To make sense, it's clear
that one must choose discomfort.
