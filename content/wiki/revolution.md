Feudalism didn't transform into capitalism one day.
We're not waiting for someone to start a revolution, but
the transformation out of capitalism is already underway.[^revolution]

There are people still living today
who were born before the rise of nationalism
and the creation of immigration controls.[^home]

From an anthropological perspective,
we're living in a historically rare period
where people are convinced that government exists for the good of people,
when in fact humans have always found [joy](/joyful-militancy)
in overthrowing authorities,
like what they did to Marcos on [EDSA revolution](/edsa-revolution)
or run away from states at every opportunity.[^power]

We can rethink success to be something much smaller in scale.
It's extremely local, sometimes on a personal level.
It's being able to grow my own food
or spend more time around the people that I love.
It's those moments where you do feel free and autonomous,
even if they're fleeting.
Take a good long look at what an actual success
that can happen in your life is and go out and try for it.
And try to remember that in between all the moments
of righteous struggle and class war you do have to live at one point.

Do what you can now:
[plant trees](/social-ecology);
[eat less meat](/veganism);
go out and spend time with loved ones;
take walks and observe.
[Nature has not stopped](/solarpunk),
and it won't for a very, very long time.

[Start also with the self](/health).
What a person thinks and how they treat themselves
follows the same template as their relationships
with family and friends,
rippling out to immediate communities and the larger society.

The goal is to [abolish](/abolition) all kinds of oppression.
Anyone who wants to
become the oppressor does not want a lasting liberation for all.
It is difficult, knowing we will be fighting it on two fronts:
neoliberalism and [fascism](/fascism).

As for me, I feel the need to stick these ideals, because learning more
about them helps me undo what needs to be undone, and unlearn what needs
to be unlearned, both in service to make space for something I have
failed to imagine.
