- Reworked the color of blockquotes on a dark-themed system.
- Added background color to footnote (back) reference links, so they can be easily distinguished.

I have long since acknowledged my terri(ble/fic) demeanor.
I am (im)patient, it goes without saying, and I have to check myself constantly before doing something or opening my mouth.

Lately, I have become more irritable towards myself, because of the petty mistakes that most likely go into flames, which I would then fan.  
No one should sustain this habit of self-depracating.
I know it's unhealthy, and yet I do it, like eating fried meat.

Society as a whole likes to drone over the shoulder to peek at the things I *should* be doing but don't. 
Sometimes, it seems disappointed, but mostly, it doesn't care.  
They don't care in the sense that they can't; 
they don't know me at all, so there's really no big reason to.
