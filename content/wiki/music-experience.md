How music is experienced will be different for each person, so I cannot
possibly cover everything here. But I am merely writing down my thoughts
and observations on the matter.

{{< toc >}}

## Familiar things

I am what people would call a Millenial coming from a lower-middle class
(if we are to believe that "middle" class exists). Music has always been
accessible to me through many organic ways:

- family playing guitar and singing songs from their time;
- same family playing CDs of their preferred genre;
- a perennial FM radio somewhere in the neighborhood blasting love songs
  all day and all night;
- videoke hits that are perpetually distorted by distance, odd audio
  mixing, or, usually, both, splitting airwaves on special occasions.

Of course, as I grew older, I got into more sophisticated stuff: 

- MP3 players meant I could personally bring my (or someone else's)
  music library with me;
- I learned to play guitar;
- then, smartphones became the all-in-one
  device that happens to also play audio files; and
- Spotify boomed to popularity with its streaming service on demand.

Music is delivered from the device to our ears via a number of
implements: wired earphones, wired headphones, each of their wireless
counterparts, including bluetooth speakers. Each of which meets a
demand, from a casual listener to an audiophile. I am sure I am leaving
a lot out of this incomplete set.

## Random thoughts

Nothing wrong with singing out loud when I am alone. I *could* go to a
videoke bar, rent a small stall for myself, and sing my heart out, but
that all of that entails spending money on a hit-and-miss sound system,
when I could have just [breath fire](/178) on my own for free.
Obligatory [quoting of myself](/285):

> By no means am I a good singer. But I grew up in a household that
> prioritized music and singing, so that was instilled in me early on.

## Time traveling

Hearing a particular music, for me, connects me to the last instance
that I heard it. It's not quite as strong as the reliving memories
triggered by smell, but it *is* quite an experience. When artist
Jean-Michel Basquiat said "music is how we decorate time," it is no
stretch to imagine it as a time-traveling device that can be
personalized to our life.
