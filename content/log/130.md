Six months of 2023---gone.
I wonder if my prime years are flying over me,
and whether in the vertigo of possibilities I am spun out of control.
But wondering can only help me when I try to put them down to writing.

## Triangular Description in Writing

I don't know if there's a literary term for this,
but I'll try to describe a writing technique I discovered somewhere:

Triangle is the simplest geometric plane enclosed in three non-linear points.
In writing, we can think of each of these points as any random object in
a place that can be highlighted to describe the setting or set the tone
of the scene. For example, one could could mention
"dusty glass, fake plants, printer paper"
to mean one is in an office.

## Origin Story of My Name

I hope it's obvious by now that I have a unique given name
(see Index page).
Naturally, people are drawn to ask the most obvious question,
so much so that I'm thinking of getting the answer to it
tattooed on me because it's FAQ:

"Why is your name Ohio?"

*Ofc*, the usual follow up questions would be:
- "Did your parents 'make' you there?" (from people who know where
  Ohio, USA, is)
- "Isn't that Japanese for 'good morning'?" (from people who [barely]
  know Japanese greetings)

My stock answer is not interesting to warrant more questions,
but it's the one I got from my parents,
so that would have to do.

That is, until, a family friend suggested a better narrative.

They speculated that my parents might be the progressive type
because, in this friend's mind, my name was inspired by
the protest song
[*Ohio* by Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_(Crosby,_Stills,_Nash_%26_Young_song)).

I doubt that my parents thought of that,
but it's definitely better,
and with my partner's blessing,
it's the story that I'm okay to tell people from now on
when they ask the origin of my name.

## Music

For the month of June 2023, I managed to go through the following
albums, one-half of which comes from the same artist.

| Album Name                     | Artist            |
|--------------------------------|-------------------|
| Desire, I Want To Get Into You | Caroline Polachek |
| Pang                           | Caroline Polachek |
| Losers/Lovers EP               | Orchards          |
| Pollen                         | Tennis            |

As always, muzak has helped me survive this month.
The concoction of esoteric and upbeat tunes held my hand and walked me
away from the awful feelings I acquired from things and events beyond my
control.

I'm not an adept weaver, at least not yet, but if I had to,
I'd say the overarching theme across these four projects is
that weird can feel good, and at times that it does,
one should embrace it.
