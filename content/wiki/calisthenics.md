Calisthenics is a form of strength training consisting of a variety of movements
that exercise large muscle groups,
often performed rhytmically and with minimal movement.

A good starting point is: [Hampton's suggested routine](https://hybridcalisthenics.com/routine).

## Current exercises

I only do one group of exercises a day (e.g., today I might do PUSH;
tomorrow CORE), and I don't necessarily do all of the exercises in each
group.

Since I'm no expert, I'll spare the details in the number of reps
and sets.

**PUSH** exercises:
- Ring push-ups ➔ Diamond push-ups ➔ regular push-ups ➔ knee push-ups ➔
  advanced incline push-ups
- [Ring, or most likely, bench] Dips
- Wall-assisted hand stands

**CORE** exercises:
- Hanging leg raises ➔ Advanced hanging knee Raises ➔ Hanging knee
  raises ➔ Full leg raises ➔ knee raises
- Hollow body hold
- L-sit
- Full Bridges
- Dragon flag

**PULL** exercises:
- Full pullups ➔ Negative pullups
    - **Cue**: Imagine bending the bar into a rainbow shape

**LEGS** exercises:
- Hindu squats
- Wall sit
