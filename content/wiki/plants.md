As someone lacking green thumb, I had given up on learning about plants.
Until now.

## Why learn about plants?

One of the great tragedies of my life is not having the right
environment to learn more about plants.

We have lived in highly urbanized areas where plants could only grown in
pots and boxes, if at all, to be controlled and monitored and protected
from external harm. My parents were not into botany.

The closest thing to learning about plants was in highschool biology
class, which was sadly stripped of beauty and curiosity... only rote
memorization.

I still live in a highly urbanized area (as of writing this), but I have
become more open to the teachings of plants. For instance, I pay special
attention to those that [grow between the cracks in concrete and pavement](/revolution).

I also think that we have no choice but have our lives be intertwined
with plants---are they not one of the major reasons why we breathe
oxygen? I suppose in learning more about them, I move away from wanting
to building a fortress world in which everyone protects what they have
instead of [sharing it](/mutual-aid). In reality, we should be rewilding
our spaces to become a forest world, as environmental lawyer Tony La
ViÃ±a said in an interview, where we work with other plants and animals
so that all of us can thrive.

## Native plants

Joy Santore introduces the concept of native plants in his post
[Why 'NATIVE' Plants?](https://www.crimepaysbutbotanydoesnt.com/blog/why-native-plants)":

> A native plant is a plant that existed in a place before humans could
> transport plant species across the globe, mixing key elements of
> ecosystems that had been separated for milliions of years by oceans, the
> equator, and the polar zones.

I used to believe that all plants are good for the environment, and that
we should start planting them as quickly and as widely as possible. Of
course, there's a lot more nuance to that, including asking things like,
are the plants be native to the area? Otherwise, planting non-native
and/or invasive plants can do more harm than good.

## Plants talk?

Western science had argued for a long time that plants cannot
communicate with other plants because "they lack the mechanisms that
animals use to speak."

But plants are not animals; [communication](/communication) must be done
through mechanisms that plants use. Robin Wall Kimmerer, botanist and author of
*Braiding Sweetgrass*, writes (emphasis mine):

> They communicate via pheromones, hormonelike compounds that are wafted
> on the breeze, laden with meaning. Scientists have identified specific
> compounds that one tree will release when it is under the stress of

> molecules of alarm, the whiff of danger. This gives them time to
> manufacture defensive chemicals... There is so much we cannot yet
> sense with our limited human capacity. **Tree conversations are still
> far above our heads.**

### Indigenous wisdom on plants

It is common among Indigenous Peoples to talk to plants and consider
them non-human persons. "Elevating" their status, thus, affords them the
same respect that humans give to other humans.

Kimmerer talks about basket weavers doing this. Before harvesting the
log of a Black Ash, traditional harvesters of Potawatomi basket weavers
asks permission and "explains his purpose" in felling the tree. Here we
recognize how Native Americans treat other non-human lives with dignity
and respect.

This also means not wasting the life matter which is akin to honoring
the life before. So, reuse scrap wood and saw dust; compost food waste.
"Take only what you need, and use what you take."

Going back to Black Ash, Kimmerer also talks about the decline of Black
Ash sapling, the age between seedling and full-grown, which according to
their investigation is the result of *under*harvesting. Black Ash needs
space to grow and develop. Crowded forests does not let light reach
through seedlings, hindering their growth. When basket makers fell trees
for basket-making, they also make room for Black Ash seedlings to grow.
Here we see an example of the harmony between humans and plants.

## The Three Sisters

Robin Wall Kimmerer, botanist and author of *Braiding Sweetgrass*, talks
about the "Three Sisters" whom the Native Americans have cultivated:
corn, beans, and squash, all working together. Incidentally, they sprout
from the ground in that order.

Firstly, corn makes light available and provides the structure for when
the vines of the beans start climbing up via circumnutation. Secondly,
beans transform the nitrogen from the atmosphere into usuable plant food
in ground, and share it among the sisters (and other creatures). This is
done with the help of *rhizobium* bacteris in the beans' roots. Finally,
the squash will stay low, and its broad leaves will shelter the base of
corn and beans, keeping moisture in, and other plants and weeds out.

As food, the three sisters also work well, nutrition-wise. Corns are
great starches and carbohydrates. Beans are high in protein. Squash
provide the vitamins.

Kimmerer provides a great analogy for Three Sisters, in terms of what
each sister could symbolize in our life:

- The corn represents [traditional ecological knowledge](/social-ecology). It has risen first and provided a structure to our social arrangements.
- The bean represents science and [technology](/technology), always
  developing and innovating to improve our ways of living.
- The squash represents ethics that provides for mutual flourishing.
