## Questioning nationalism

Robin Wall Kimmerer on her book *Braiding Sweetgrass*, she rightfully
questions the essence of so-called Pledge of Allegiance and how it it
might just be lip service to the supposed meaning behind its text. Like
many other pledges of allegiance (like Philippines'
"[*Panatang Makabayan*](https://qnas.edu.ph/panatang-makabayan-revised-2023/)"
that has been revised many times),
it is supposed to be patriotic in a time when nationalism has never been
a gateway to solving our society's ills. Nationalist text, I dare say,
like Pledge, even reveals the hypocricies of those in power.
