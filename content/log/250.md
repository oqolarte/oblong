- Finished NNT's *Skin in the Game* and added it to the [list](/books).

## Brief review of *Skin in the Game*

Taleb has many interesting ideas which may have likely come from
synthesizing different ancient and contemporary wisdoms with his own
personal life changing experiences. He offers, per usual, many insights
in this book, on which I gave [my own reflections](/skin-in-the-game).
He remains philosophical and sharp, especially against people and
institutions that need to be culled by such sharpness. While
self-professed "libertarian" I wonder if he's on the *right* side of the
political spectrum... not that it matters. It got a bit boring for me
towards the end. I *might* reread this again in the future, though.
