Access to internet is important in this age of information,
but do we have the necessary infra for it to be accessible to everyone,
no matter the social status?

Consider this: students without internet access are at
[risk of educational lag](/pedagogy),
especially when [educational institutions](/academy) embed more of
learning resources online, usually behind paywall.
It doesn't help that our physical public libraries are not well-funded
to keep up with the learning demand.

Internet access should be universal, equitable, and non-discriminatory,
not a commodity to be bought and sold for profit.

Now, internet, at its core, means a [network of computers](/network) on a global
scale, which uses the internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to communicate
between networks and devices.

Traditional networks are called on-premise networks, which means that
all of the devices used for network operations are kept at a physical
location owned by the company, like in an office building, for example.

In the recent years, "somebody else's computer" that one can access via
the internet can be referred to as the "[cloud](/cloud-computing)".
