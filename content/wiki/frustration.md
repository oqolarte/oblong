> "If someone can satisfy you then they can frustrate you. Only someone
> who gives you frustration can give you satisfaction...You know someone
> matters to you if they can frustrate you. It was because [King]
> Lear, as he says so poignantly, 'loved her most' (I.i.) that Cordelia
> most distressed him; and by the end of the play is his most fully
> realized loss...Lear can't live without the love of women, and he
> can't live with the way in which he demands love from them. The demand
> for love is always a doubt about love; and all doubt begins as a doubt
> about love. All love stories are frustration stories...To fall in love
> is to be reminded of a frustration that you didn't know you had: you
> wanted someone, you felt deprived of something, and then it seems to
> be there. And what is renewed in that experience is an intensity of
> frustration, and an intensity of satisfaction. It is as if, oddly, you
> were waiting for someone but you didn't know who they were until they
> arrived. Whether or not you were aware that there was something
> missing in your life, you will be when you meet the person you want.
> What psychoanalysis will add to this love story is that the person you
> fall in love with is really the man or woman of your dreams; that you
> have dreamed them up before you met them; not out of nothing--nothing
> comes of nothing--but out of prior experience, both real and wished
> for.You recognize them with such certainty because you already, in a
> certain sense, know them; and because you have quite literally been
> expecting them, you feel as though you have known them forever, and
> yet at the same time they are quite foreign to you. They are familiar
> foreign bodies.
>
> But there is a world of difference between erotic and romantic
> daydream and actually getting together with someone; getting together
> is a lot more work, and is never exactly what one was hoping for. So
> there are three consecutive frustrations: the frustration of need, the
> frustration of fetishized satisfaction not working, and the
> frustration of satisfaction in the real world being at odds with the
> wished-for, fantasized satisfaction. Three frustrations, three
> disturbances, and two disillusionments. It is, what has been called in
> a different context, a cumulative trauma of desire. And this is when
> it works.
>
> Thought is what makes frustration bearable, and frustration makes
> thought possible. Thinking modifies frustration, rather than evading
> it, by being a means by which we can go from feeling frustrated to
> figuring out what to do about it, and doing it--what might be called
> imagination--leading to real action in reality. And the ability to
> think also means, and depends upon, the ability to have a
> conversation. It is, we should note, the gulf between wanting and
> actually doing something about it...For Freud and Wilfred Bion,
> satisfaction takes thought."
