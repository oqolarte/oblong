Tarsius, the synth-drum duo behind this album, is okay, maybe even
great, to hear perform live, say, in a street party in Escolta, when you
are sweating and getting smog-rained on, the crowd politely etching
their bodies into spacetime with as little movement as possible. It is
NOT okay as a background muzak when cleaning the house after floodwater
had come and gone.
