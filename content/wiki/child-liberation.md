Children are one of the most overlooked group of people who are denied
any semblance of autonomy or dignity.

It's in youth that we are taught to obey authority. Those who are
liberated in youth are less likely to accept oppressive structures later
in life. And without that acceptance, those structures would struggle to
perpetuate themselves.

Child liberation looks to abolish systems that dominate and abuse
children systemically. Think about how children are often viewed as the
property of their parents.

An example of when children's liberation is needed: Look at kids who
run away from abusive homes with authoritarian parents/guardians.
And the police's role is to simply return
them to their parents. Pursuit of child liberation could look like
communal resources such as housing, food, and "parental" care being
offered communally, so that children have the ability to leave abusive
households if needed and also have the ability to return or slowly
reconnect as they think is best.
