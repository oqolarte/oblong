In radical spaces, well-versed hot takes might indicate the sayer has
good [politics](/politics). But surely, that's not the only way to
participate in daily politics, right?

## Toxic activism

Misplaced wokeness has toxified activism.
It becomes a performance,
rather than the Thing that should be done.
Bigger, more mainstream movements,
with charismatic people at the helm,
often tokenize marginalized people to further the agenda.

In reality, there are many forms of activism,
and it doesn't have to burn anyone out.
It doesn't necessarily have to put oneself on public display,
especially when one doesn't want a large target on their back.

It can be [a secret act that sabotages](/sabotage) the flow of profit
from workers' labor into the elites' pockets.

But all the same,
living the [revolution](/revolution) is actively practicing
the beliefs in the here and now.

[Activism can and should at times make us feel alive](/joyful-militancy),
physically,
emotionally, socially, spiritually. Otherwise, what's the point?

## Mindfulness in radical spaces

When one does finally take to action, one must also consider the degree
of involvement. Robin Wall Kimmerer, ecologist and author of *Braiding Sweetgrass*,
when she had decided to clean a pond for swimming, observes, "Transformation
is not accomplished by tentative wading at the edge."

As a cishet male, I must be mindful whether I am taking up valuable
space and time from those I share them with. Some points to consider:

- Am I making the space safer for neurodivergent people? If not, what
  are the ways that I can actively make that happen?
- Am I advocating for [violence](/violence) when it comes to dealing with those who
  do not share similar politics? If so, how does that affect
  the people I'm sharing the space with who may not be as eager?
- Am I or someone in the space is a serial rambler? If so, how can we
  moderate this as a group? Can we as a group ensure that participants
  have an equal amount of air time when voicing their thoughts?
- In wanting to provide a safer space for those I hold dear, do I
  stop and check if I am destroying other people's safe spaces?

## Learning from the past

When we look back to our collective past and history, are we remembering
the stories for all the lessons we hope might (re)teach us, or are we
re-traumatizing ourselves, opening again not-yet healed wounds?

Remembering is more productive, especially when we are able to convert
the emotions to actions of solidarity.

Re-traumatizing might just want us to react in anger, might even pave
the way to [fascist thought](/fascism).

### "Never again"

In many activist circles in the [so-called Philippines](/pilipinas), we
chant "Never again" to mean "Never again to Marcos dictatorship" and "never again to the atrocities and human rights violations." And in
1986, this energy [mobilized people to occupy EDSA](/edsa-revolution)
that eventually lead to the ousting of the dictator Marcos Sr.

But do we also mean "never again to any form of authoritarian rule, no
matter who it is or what Party is at the top"?

Do we mean "never again to any form of [violence](/violence), from the
brutal to the invisible, to all life forms"?

Do we mean "never again to any form of hierarchy, because it undoubtedly
breeds many forms of oppression"?

## Activists' commitment

"The activist's commitment must be to get at the truth, even at the
price of breaking the law," advises Walden Bello in his book *Global
Battlefields*. Laws are written by well-off, privileged
people who claim to represent us, but almost always the masses do not
have a say on this. We have to ask for whom these laws really apply to.
As activists, we need to highlight the many ways this asymmetry affects
our lives.
