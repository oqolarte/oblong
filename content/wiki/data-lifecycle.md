The data lifecycle is an important model that [security](/security)
teams consider when [protecting information](/infosec). It influences
how they set policies that align with business objectives. It also plays
an important role in the [technologies](/technology) security teams use
to make information accessible.

In general, the data lifecycle has five stages:

- Collect
- Store
- Use
- Archive
- Destroy

## Data governance

Organizations and businesses handle massive amounts of data every day.
New information is constantly being collected from internal and external
sources. A structured approach to managing all of this data is the best
way to [keep it private](/privacy) and secure.

Data governance is a set of processes that define how an organization
manages information. Governance often includes policies that specify how
to keep data private, accurate, available, and secure throughout its
lifecycle.

Effective data governance is a collaborative activity that relies on
people. Data governance policies commonly categorize individuals into a
specific role:

- **Data owner**: the person that decides who can access, edit, use, or
  destroy their information. Data owners have administrative control
  over specific information hardware or software and are accountable for
  the classification, protection, access, and use of organization's
  data.
- **Data custodian**: anyone or anything that's responsible for the safe
  handling, transport, and storage of information. Custodians are
  responsible for implementing [security controls](/security-controls)
  for the data they are responsible for, granting and revoking access to
  that data.
- **Data steward**: the person or group that maintains and implements
  data governance policies set by an organization.

Data governance policies often assign accountability to data owners,
custodians, and stewards.

## Protecting data at every stage

Most security plans include a specific policy that outlines how
information will be managed across an organization. This is known as a
data governance policy. These documents clearly define procedures that
should be followed to participate in keeping data safe. They place
limits on who or what can access data. Security professionals are
important participants in data governance.
