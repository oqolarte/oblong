A **vulnerability scanner** is software that automatically compares
known vulnerabilities and exposures against the technologies on the
[network](/network). In general, these tools scan systems to find
misconfigurations or programming flaws.

[Scanning tools](https://owasp.org/www-community/Vulnerability_Scanning_Tools) are used to analyze the five attack surfaces discussed in
[defense in depth strategy](/defense-in-depth): perimieter, network,
endpoint, application, and data.

When a scan of any layer begins, the scanning tool compares the findings
against databases of security threats. At the end of the scan, the tool
flags any vulnerabilities that it finds and adds them to its reference
database. Each scan adds more information to the database, helping the
tool be more accurate in its analysis.

**Note**: Vulnerability databases are also routinely updated by the company
that designed the scanning software.

## Performing scans

Vulnerability scanners are meant to be non-intrusive. Meaning, they
donâ€™t break or take advantage of a system like an attacker would.
Instead, they simply scan a surface and alert you to any potentially
unlocked doors in your systems.

**Note**: While vulnerability scanners are non-intrusive, there are
instances when a scan can inadvertently cause issues, like crash a
system.

There are a few different ways that these tools are used to scan a surface.

### External vs. internal

External and internal scans simulate an attacker's approach.

*External scans* test the perimeter layer outside of the internal
network. They analyze outward facing systems, like websites and
[firewalls](/firewall). These kinds of scans can uncover vulnerable
things like vulnerable network ports or servers.

*Internal scans* start from the opposite end by examining an
organization's internal systems. For example, this type of scan might
analyze application software for weaknesses in how it handles user
input.

### Authenticated vs. unauthenticated

Authenticated and unauthenticated scans simulate whether or not a user
has access to a system.

*Authenticated scans* might test a system by logging in with a real user
account or even with an admin account. These service accounts are used
to check for vulnerabilities, like
[broken access controls](/owasp/#broken-access-control).

Unauthenticated scans simulate external threat actors that do not have
access to your business resources. For example, a scan might analyze
file shares within the organization that are used to house internal-only
documents. Unauthenticated users should receive "access denied" results
if they tried opening these files. However, a vulnerability would be
identified if you were able to access a file.

### Limited vs. comprehensive

Limited and comprehensive scans focus on particular devices that are
accessed by internal and external users.

*Limited scans* analyze particular devices on a network, like searching for misconfigurations on a firewall.

*Comprehensive scans* analyze all devices connected to a network. This includes operating systems, user databases, and more.

**Pro tip**: Discovery scanning should be done prior to limited or comprehensive scans. Discovery scanning is used to get an idea of the computers, devices, and open ports that are on a network.
