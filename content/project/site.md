This site is itself a personal project, a documentation of other projects that I log here. 
If we are to use modern internet terms, this is also a wiki.

## Front-end

As you are well aware, this site has a very simple design.

By foregoing intricate UI/UX design, I can focus on what matters most: *content*. 
Let me explain.

By simplifying the design, I'm making this site less bloated.
This means that:
- old computers with slow and outdated software can visit without hassle on their end;
- locations with slow internet connectivity can still browse the content;
- I can also improve this site's accessibility by improving some functions;
- no distractions 

## Back-end

I use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a static site generator to build this site.
There are many other big names out there, like Jekyll, Gatsby, Pelican, and Hexo, but I have no experience using them.
I have no particular reason why I chose Hugo, except maybe that it's written in Go.
And some experts say that most software developed using a compiled language (which Go is) can be "blazing fast."

## Inspiration

Back in high school, I'm not the brightest pupil in our computer lab, and I'm okay with that.
One of our "lab works" was to create our own website.
I don't remember how mine looked, but I'm sure it's basic, with broken links hither and thither.

More than a decade later, here I am, building one again.
At least I retained the important bits on how HTML works, and I'm not starting from zero.

I'd like to say that I dedicate this to my former self, who couldn't seem to grasp the importance of web design.

Here are some other sites from which I got inspiration:
- Low-tech Magazine, the [solar-powered one](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com). Their article on [how to build a low-tech website](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2018/09/how-to-build-a-lowtech-website.html) is eye-opening.
- [1MB Club](https://1mb.club), and it's contemporaries, [512KB Club](https://512kb.club), and [250KB Club](https://250kb.club)
- The "[Best Motherfucking Website](https://bestmotherfucking.website)"

## Digital Garden

If you've been looking around for personal websites like I have, "digital garden" is a phrase that gets used often.

Webmasters, the owners, consider the websites as their digital garden, in which they plant seeds of ideas, and hope to grow them sustainably.
It's a more endearing term, I believe, than, say, a public-facing journal or simply blog.
They all function the same.

This site, then, is my digital garden.
Expect that things will be edited, deleted, updated, *grown*, depending on my disposition.
People change (they need to, lest they stagnate) and their beliefs, their knowledge change with them.
