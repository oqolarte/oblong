## Family, lately

Family is scary because they are made up of people one is bound to grow
apart from, and during this time of growing distance, people change
towards multiple directions the effects to the familial ties one can't
even begin to imagine.

And so, we embrace change. At least, we try.

For those times that I think I can't face an impending change, I study
the term "devil" as it may be useful when describing the part of self
that attempts to court its own ruin as well as the potential effects to
those near [and/or dear ("family")].

Family is spooky, because it is willing to implode when it starts
discussing inheritance. So when I refer to the devil playing a part in
this, ask: am I really hinting at the religious concepts, or something
more human?

## Dream last night

It was a snowy night. Everything covered in white seemed to be glowing
softly despite having no street lamps outside. I looked out the window
and saw two columns of mushroom clouds: the farthest was already at its
peak formation; the nearest was about 30 meters away, still climbing its
way up to its zenith. Then came the shockwaves, better late than never,
shattering glass and teeth. Finally entered the terror that our house
would probably be bombed next. The body heat was increasing because of
anxiety.

"This is my end," I said. "I thought I wouldn't be afraid to die, but
everyday I learn new things about myself."
