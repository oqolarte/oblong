Today, I got a new haircut, care of Isya.
We've been planning this for a while,
but certain predicaments kept getting in the way of my having a new look.

Having a curtain as a makeshift apron over my torso as shield against falling hair,
under the 30-degree-something-Celsius weather,
only made me sweat more than usual.
A small sacrifice to make.

It should be said that this isn't the first time that Isya has cut my hair.
I liked the result of the last time,
and I like the one now.

*Sulit!*

*This is Day 2 of [Old Computer Challenge](/old-computer).*
