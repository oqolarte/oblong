*Staring into the distance is the on-going side quest that I'm
meant to do so long as at least one of my eyes work.*

## Skipping Muzak

Since the beginning of this year, I was listening to albums in their
entirety, going in order from track 1 to the last.
A habit that I had foregone when I entered college,
which was around the time when my siblong gifted me my first and only
iPod Shuffle.

As my friend told me back then,
"You're life is already chaotic as it is;
why would you want your playlist to be on shuffle?"
We both chuckled at his remark,
but I knew he was right.
It probably it's not the brightest idea to throw randomness in one's
listening habits, but there we were.

Lately, it got me thinking:
I inherited this habit from the people closest to me!
My parents would often skip songs in albums,
and/or just jump right into the one or two songs that they like
before changing to the next CD.
My sibling was no different.
And then I was no different.

Now, we're in the age of music when we're becoming less interested in
song titles and tend to skip them completely. Access to information,
blazing fast, could not have egged listeners (like me) to pause and look
at the metadata, know the artist, know the song. In randomized
playlists, only parts of lyrics and their melodies are recognizable. At
least, that's what's happening to me.

## Cycling as commute to and from Work

I need to be honest.
I like riding bicycles,
and it's likely it will be the case for a long while.
Bikes give me freedom---I'm able to traverse long distances
if I only let myself be the master of my own metaphorical flight.

What I don't like about cycling is the bike infrastructure that lacks
(or isn't there, really) in cities I frequent to.
I don't like how the few narrow bike lanes not only are tokenized by LGU
but is also eventually physically coopted by motorists
(except the lanes with barriers),
like how they coopted sidewalks.
This isn't flight, but urban plight.
And it's draining.

At night, when the lights are out and the fur babies have settled
to their nests, my brain reminds of the close calls of the day.
If I hadn't felt fear on the moment it happened,
now is the time shudder.
Overall, not a good feeling.

But I feel like I must continue riding to work,
in solidarity with other cyclists, and even pedestrians.
To signal that, indeed, it's possible, if hard,
to move around cities in two wheels.
