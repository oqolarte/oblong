## Concept of Dangal

Dangal refers to social honor and dignity. The concept of dangal
includes knowing what is morally right ("what is right?"), feeling what
is morally good ("how much do we care about others?"), and acting in a
way that is morally desirable ("am I doing things right?").

The dominant norms of dangal are:
- *pagkabahala* (concern) - means to have responsibility over the
  welfare of other people. Showing no concern, and necessarily awa, is
  to be inhuman.
- *paggalang* (respect) - is an important norm about respecting one's
  and others' honor, dignity, status, and feelings.
- *utang na loob* (debt of gratitude, moral obligation) is a sense of
  reciprocal social obligation. One is expected to pay back/forward the help
  they received, which when abused leads to graft
  and corruption. *Utang na loob* is precursor to [mutual aid](/mutual-aid), a radical act of expressing gratitude that creates solidarity among interacting
  people.
