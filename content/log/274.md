Tiny projects and experiments that have little to no risk of failing or
leaving one in ruins could be seen as practices for both one's
creativity and will to move away from convenient pull of consumerism.
For example, I am [using](/tools) an origami coin purse because all the
last leather one was too bulky. This is fine for regular use as it
forces me to only bring *enough* coins for errands.
