And by messenger, I mean the one, who picks up a package from point A
and delivers it to point B on a fixed-gear bike. Definitely NOT the
Facebook messaging app.

Anyway, my partner and I have decided to sell some of the
physical books that we won't be reading anymore. Instead of just
collecting dust here, it's for the best to rid the space of them with
the bonus of earning small cash.

Since setting up the virtual shop at
[Carousell](https://www.carousell.ph), we have made a few successful
sales of our pre-loved books. I'd just like to record this particular
run of making several trips around the district, [riding on my (t)rusty bike](/50).
I was essentially our own e-shop's bike messenger for the morning.

## 1st stop: Residential

First drop of the morning was at a residence within 2-km radius of our
house. I offered to personally deliver the book to this client, who I'd
wager works in a creative industry, for
free to save on shipping fee. Traffic was light. I felt safe.

## 2nd stop: Bank

Needed to drop by the bank to withdraw cash from ATM. Still, traffic was
relatively calm, because it's already past rush hour. But the sun was
getting higher, and the day hotter. Not banking on the forecast that
weather would be cold until March 2025 at this rate.

## 3rd stop: LBC

Next stop was at a local [LBC](https://www.lbcexpress.com/) branch to
drop books bound for Cebu. I might have been an early customer because
they had no change for my payment. I had to go back to the bank that I
had just been to (which is just across the adjacent intersection, so
it's not far; inconvenient, though) to withdraw more cash, but this
time in lower denomination. After completing the transaction at the LBC,
I overheard some of the employees talking about how LBC is
closing some of their branches, likely including this one, as a "business
decision."

## 4th stop: J&T Express

Fourth and final stop was a bit circuitous to get to from my last point.
It doesn't help that I tend to not have a robust mental cartography. But
I got at this [J&T Express](https://www.jtexpress.ph/) branch to drop
the last book bound for Pampanga.

I must say, their customer service is NOT good at all, to put it mildly.
They weren't rude to me or anything like that; but it's as if interacting with me was not prioritized for some reason despite being the only customer there.
Also, I had to install their app,
which as of writing is [rated by many only 2.7 stars out of 5 in Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jtexpress.PhClient&hl=en),
just to avail their service. I had to confirm this with the clerk in front
of me to make sure I got that right.

"Why do I have to do that when I'm already
physically here at the store?" I thought. It's like those restaurants
whose menu one can only access by scanning their QR code.
Contrary to the trend among business owners, forcing people to interact
with smartphones to avail the products/services doesn't necessarily
improve the customer experience.

## Lessons learned today

- Personally delivering books is fun and worth the ride. Apart from
  walking the dog, it's a nice way to get out of the house and get into
  neighborhoods that I won't normally find myself in. I would likely
  offer personal delivery to other buyers if they're within 3-4 kms our
  home.
- J&T Express is not even in my list of options for mode of delivery.
  Today, I am reminded why.
- Reviewing the options for mode of delivery, I delisted
  [Grab](https://www.grab.com/ph/) (and would likely not use it anymore
  for personal errands) because "[Grab, JoyRide, GET Express admit to making their drivers absorb passenger discounts](https://pcij.org/2025/01/19/grab-joyride-get-express-admit-making-drivers-absorb-passenger-discounts/),"
  according to a recent investigative report by PCIJ.
