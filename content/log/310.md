I did not realize that NNN, within the context of this blog, meant No
News November. But here I am, popping in last minute to write a
"November dump", like what the cooler kids in major socmeds do.

## Bangkok, Thailand

It may seem like we had planned to escape the typhoons that ravaged the
archipelago the first week of NOV 2025, but this first and only
out-of-the country trip of 2025 (the so-called "bounce-back" year) was
really a vacation from the humdrum of our Quezon City lives.

Some travel is prerequisite to some growth.

But was it really a vacation when Bangkok has a lot of similarities with
our hometown? When the thick humid air reminds you of the place you just
left?

The answer is: yes. Yes, it is.

In transportation alone, Bangkok beats the whole of Metro Manila
(Manila) by several train lines, and by having cooler-headed motorists.

I also read somewhere that Bangkok is a non-government organization
(NGO) hub. True enough, some family and friends we met this month
reminisced their good memories traveling to the city for NGO work.
Listening to their stories teleported me back to a specific work meeting
I was in a few years ago, in which former colleagues were talking about
the different golf courses they had played in. My brain works oddly
sometimes, and I didn't know why it connected these instances that could
not be farther apart. Was it because of the NGO-ization of social
movements on one hand, and the corporatization of human experiences in
the other?

I had to remind myself that while I hate the effects of
neoliberal globalization, people are allowed to find joyful moments in
their lives; and that for Greater Good (whatever that means) to
eventually happen, I must avoid policing the agency of those who
actively steer society to that direction.

## Work

While co-working, a friend recently told me that they are now
"officially unemployed." I did not think they were asking for any
advice, nor do I have any wise words to tell them---as I myself am
unemployed for a little over a year now---other than "Welcome to the
club!"

With prolonged unemployment comes the uneasy feeling of seeing your
savings dwindle, no matter how frugal you have lived the past 12 months.

## Movies watched

Film reviews in short burst

### *Train to Busan* (2016)

Rewatching this took me back to a time when filmmakers were innovating
zombie films. I don't know whether they've stopped doing that, but this
film was a second wind to a dying genre (pun intended). Horror films
need not be *just* scary and creepy; they can also be funny,
hyperbolic, somewhat political, and bittersweet.
**Rating: 7 out of 10**

### *A Girl And A Guy* (2021)

A mid movie about coming-of-age people as they explore relationships
before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic era. I think the film
tried to pack a lot of things and did too many gimmicks, but none of
which were delivered great. *Lahat, sakto lang.*
**Rating: 6 out of 10**

### *Frankenstein* (2025)

[DNF the book](/books/#did-not-finish) but from what I heard, it's as good as this movie
adaptation. Guillermo del Toro's interpretation is great at what he
does: romanticizing the macabre in visually stunning ways. Victor
Frankenstein was flawed, but there were glimpses of his humanity.
**Rating: 8 out of 10**

### *The Substance* (2024)

Do not bank on your looks, or else aging not only will be disgraceful
but also self-destructive.
**Rating: 7 out of 10**

### *Wicked: For Good* (2025)

This one is less impactful than the first movie. Rushed, it feels like.
Only a few scenes are well-executed. It seems to me that filmmakers poured
all their effort into the first movie and propped it as an elaborate,
expensive hook to ensure revenue for when people must inevitably watch
this second (and last) one.
**Rating: 6 out of 10**

## Musings

Weird interactions with the self

### On catastrophes

Sometimes, I imagine myself in catastrophes.

I did it during our flight to and from Bangkok---the plane succumbing to
engine failure and the whole thing going up in flames, everything and
everyone roaring in unison.

I sometimes do it when I remember the times I almost drowned---what if
the water did immobilize me and I sunk?

I often do it whenever I am surrounded by motorists---a freewheeling
ten-wheeler truck losing brake and then barrel-rolling all over innocent
pedestrians and cyclists, including myself.

None of these help me get out of funks.

### On walking after Leg Day

Walking around the city with legs aching (and recovering) from a recent
workout felt like trekking through dangerous fields. It is hard to go on
with measured steps because all motorists are impatient. And in many
ways, the city *is* already dangerous for many vulnerable road users:
people with disabilities, senior citizens, even animals.

### On rat poison

In another life in another parallel universe, I will be an ineffective
rat poison, so impotent that I would actually do the reverse: I, as a
product of statistically improbable accidental mix in a dilapidated
laboratory, would instead be a salve for the urban rodents. Any rats
consuming me would become stronger. But more importantly, they would be
equipped by the wisdom I have had in *this* universe, in *this* life.
Each of them will, too, have weird interactions with themselves.
