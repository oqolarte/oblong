## New work

Onboarding a new employee like me at New Work means ingesting a deluge
of new information previously irrelevant to my past lives, while staring
for at a computer screen for at least 8 hours. Exhaustion hit me like a
familiar foe. I am already reminded of my stance on both
[work](/anti-work) and [AI](/ai).

The term "productivity" is finding its way again in my orbit. It started
when I was trying to set up
[VimWiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki) in Windows 11. I needed a
note-taking system that felt familiar and is reliable. For others, it is
the form of [Fathom](https://www.fathom.ai/) ("Never Take Notes Again"
is their tagline as of writing). For me, it is VimWiki.

## Early morning walks

In anticipation of New Work, I have scheduled walking the dog early in the
morning.

Early La Niña mornings in January paint the sky ashen and set the air
cool. Already I am recognizing some characters consistently showing up.
Some of them are jogging. Some of them are young people going to school,
sipping soft drinks in a plastic bag (not a good way to start the day,
in my opinion). We wonder how adults in the community could guide the
kids away from these and other harmful substances.

## Summary

(*This last section is partly a joke. I am in the middle of a lot of
training materials, and they all have to have a nice little wrap-up.*)

I now have a New Work, because of which I walk the dog way early in the
morning.
