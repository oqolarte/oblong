Like so many people,
I'm not fond of hearing a recording of my voice.
How I sound when heard from a digital---and I suspect, analog, too---is
very different in terms of its impact to me.

Some people say it has something to do with the resonance of the skull
that makes one's own voice sound different to an external body.
