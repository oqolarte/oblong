In and out of work, I'm a researcher,
but more importantly,
I'm a generalist who has always longed to learn and make something.
These days, that thing skews abstract,
but if life improves,
I hope to create more tangible things that would sometimes be useful.
When I have time, I also read all kinds of [books](/books).
