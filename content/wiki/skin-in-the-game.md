*Mostly raw notes from Nassim Nicholas Taleb's book of the same title.
Each paragraph can be considered a self-contained note.*

## Intro

"Never ask anyone for their opinion, forecast, or recommendation. Just
ask them what they have---or don't have---in their portfolio," the
author advises. Further, "Never ask a doctor what you should do. Ask him
what he would do if were in your place."

The oligarchy who runs the world doesn't necessarily impose their taste
on us. We also try to emulate what they do, to attain what they
have, or to reach their status by, uh, pirating some of the stuff they
own. In doing so, we fool ourselves that we have reached a new
elevation, something supposed to be granted only to exclusive people.

## Notes on as/symmetry

Tails
: In terms of probabilities, tails are an extreme event of low frequency.

"Better" than the golden rule, author recommends the **silver rule**:

> *Do not treat others the way you would not like them to treat you.*

Which, growing up, is what the golden rule is for me...? Anyway, the
silver rule applies to every level of social relations, not just the
individual level. Reasonable, I say, but not always obvious to a lot of
people, especially when one starts scaling up in numbers, involving more
and more people.

For the most part of human history, we have been doing things without
necessarily knowing everything about *how* each component of the system
works, or even *why* we do them. Experience teaches better than theory.

**Scientism**, which the author puts as a "naive interpretation of
science as complication rather than science as a process and a skeptical
enterprise," persists because science depends on the current social
relationships in which it exists. In a [capitalistic society](/capitalism),
science can be "peer-reviewed" to promote innovations that would
ultimately direct more profit to the ruling class. Few examples of such
innovations:
- personalized and targeted ads
- cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens
- planned obsolescence of consumer electronics

The author offers a rule for skepticism:

> *Those who talk should do and only those who do should talk*.

So, applying this to my current life, I must first live *the* meaningful
life that I want to have enough experience to [write something worth reading](/writing).

As much as possible, don't use products that even their developers,
founders, and/or makers do not use. Few examples:

- [Social media bosses never got high on their own supply](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/23/never-get-high-on-your-own-supply-why-social-media-bosses-dont-use-social-media)
- Bill Gates and Steve Jobs were reported to have "[banned their kids from iPads and other devices they created](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hidden-side-steve-jobs-bill-165424007.html)."
- Of course, some drug pushers choose not to get high on their own supply.

On choosing citizenship, the author shares his choice to pledge
allegiance with the USA, and how being an American "became [his]
identity, good or bad, tax or no tax." I can't help but compare this
with a friend of a friend, whom I will just call here Dong. Dong is an
American who has lived here in the [so-called Philippines](/pilipinas) for many
decades now. To be fair with him, he speaks conversational Tagalog and
Cebuano, his own commitment to being with the local peoples. But when
finally asked about his passport, Dong admits that he doesn't want to
take the Philippine passport because it would "severely limit the number
of countries [he] could go to."

When traveling abroad, people would prefer familiar places like
McDonald's rather than "risk" uncertainty. I know this, because we
sometimes do this on our travels, too.

Funnily (but maybe rightfully too), the author places fundamentalist
atheism in the same bucket as Protestant Christianity and Salafi Islam
in terms of dumb people unwilling to see ambiguity.

**Be intolerant of those who are intolerant** for [they will rise to power](/fascism)
and enforce their beliefs, or destroy those who oppose them.

## Agency

Food-prep anecdote: When I am hungry, I look for and prepare food for
myself, which I will of course share with the household. More
importantly, I will make sure that I would finish the food myself if,
say, I cooked it poorly that others might not want to eat it anymore.

"Selling cannot be deemed advice." This reminds me of the 99% of
financial advisers in the Philippines who are unfortunately trained
*not* to follow any [fiduciary duty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiduciary),
but are programmed to peddle products that would get them the fattest
commissions.

[Communities](/community) cannot be effective when they grow [too] large
in number; and American-style federalism isn't the answer either. Maybe
federalism alone sans Americanization; maybe a global network of
decentralized of grassroots communities; but each doesn't need to be
spun into a western flavor, contrary to what the author argues. And
"just put[ting] some markers somewhere" won't certainly make groups of
people friendlier. Borders, especially drawn arbitrarily by the ruling
class---and let's not kid ourselves, even in the hypothetical scenario,
it's always the ruling class who would race to the maps to draw
lines---have only caused harm to people who are near and around them.

The author mentioned the [Green Lumber Fallacy](https://fs.blog/green-lumber-fallacy/), which, to sum, talks
about how theory is very different from real world practice or, as Shane
Parrish distills it, "the real causative factors of success are often
hidden from us." As for me,
I would relate this idea to
[Sherlock Holmes's knowledge and skills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes#Knowledge_and_skills),
who *only* had mastered some relevant to his being "consulting
detective" but nothing more or less. In a way,
[many engineers are like this](/engineering): knowing mostly the practical side of physics to be
applied to real world uses.

**Reminder to self**: *Try* to avoid [over]intellectualizing things and
phenomenons, especially at the expense of physical and/or mental health.
Many things are not worth stressing about; many things are not worth
understanding.

Rich people are the most obvious targets of phony
sophistications---nouveau riche, more so---because bullshit keeps them
and the carrion around them alive. For example: "[AI Brad Pitt dupes French woman out of €830,000](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgnz8rw1xgo)."
Many simple things in life they would shun in exchange for more
unnecessarily complex things, all because they have the resources for
it.

[Avoid debating with strangers](/debate), especially online.
No verbal threats. *Maybe* a warning, as a last attempt at good will,
but no more.
Escalate only when necessary, and [act on it](/direct-action).

It's hard to correct a structural defect.
It will correct itself [by collapsing](/collapse).

The idea of having skin in the game is congruous with
[prefiguration](/prefiguration), in that we must live the life we want
now.

Virtue signaling is not a new concept, and we need to remind our zealous
Christian friends with the [words on Matthew 6: 1-4 on how to give](https://www.biblestudytools.com/csb/matthew/6.html):

> "Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of people, to
> be seen by them. Otherwise, you will have no reward from your Father
> in heaven. So whenever you give to the poor, don't sound a trumpet
> before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets,
> to be applauded by people. I assure you: They've got their reward! But
> when you give to the poor, don't let your left hand know what your
> right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret. And your
> Father who sees in secret will reward you."

In short, show don't tell.

Never engage in [rent-seeking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking).

[Never start a business](/no-business), contrary to what the author
suggests. One could take risks *and* help others by starting a [mutual aid](/mutual-aid).

"Real people are interested in commonalities and peace, not conflicts
and wars," Taleb argues. Because even in the language of
[economics](/economics), the latter is more expensive. In the language
of humanity/ies, we would thrivemore on the former.

Absence of Black Swans in history doesn't mean they weren't there. It
just means the record hasn't been long enough.

## Praxis over theory, in terms of freedom

Freedom entails risk that, in many cases, is worth taking because the
upside, if freedom is shared generously with others, is bigger than the
downside. This way of ensuring the my freedom directly ties with your
freedom makes it more robust, if not [antifragile](/antifragile) completely.

As the author keeps repeating, freedom is never free. He explains that
detractors, if they cannot harm you or your freedom, they might come
after your friends, family, or peers who are associated with you. Such
detractors are necessarily unethical, to say the least,a for putting
other people's skin in their game.

## Taking certain risks

In the Philippines, the norm for many [has-been] celebrities is to run
for public office for their enrichment. This is unethical, according to
Taleb, and many Filipinos who are still fond of [critical thinking](/critical-thinking) would
agree with him.

> *Who watches the watchmen?*  
> -- [Politically] The Watched.  
> -- [Universally] Time.  

Time is the ultimate filter. Anything exposed to reality will be exposed
to Time. For something to be regarded as significant among society, it
must first be exposed to reality, i.e., be in the real world and have
skin in the game. Ideas need to be tested in the field. Collaborations
will have to have a physical component to it.
