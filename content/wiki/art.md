Remember, art is all about self-expression and creativity.
You don't always need fancy tools;
your [imagination](/surrealism) is your most valuable asset.

## Art begets art

Art has the power to reflect the complexities of the human
experience, to capture emotions, tell stories, and provoke thought.
It can serve as a mirror to society, highlighting issues, values, and
beliefs. But, art often doesn't provide clear (re)solutions to these issues.

Art can inspire change, raise awareness, and ignite conversations, but
it's usually up to individuals, communities, and societies to take
action and find resolutions to the challenges they face. Art can be a
catalyst for [change](/revolution),
but it's not a substitute for the practical steps
needed to address complex problems.

Being a snob, instead of actually making the effort to find ways to
enjoy and benefit from art, removes the joy in those pieces, all in the
name of a "refined" status. Be snob? BS!

### Art under Capitalism

However, art could never flourish under [capitalism](/capitalism).
In [a system that doesn't compel you to labor for basic needs](/anti-work),
everyone's artistic potential could be unlocked.

All humans are artists, but under capitalism we don't have the time to
cultivate our artistic senses. Moreover, while the myth of tortured
genius surely predates capitalism, it lingers in these modern times. I
wouldn't be shocked if many believers of capitalism might argue that
without the suffering it naturally causes, beautiful works might never
have come to life. What a twisted idea.

In Hazel Weakly's blog post *[The Trap of Soulless Productivity](https://hazelweakly.me/blog/soulless-productivity/)*, she puts it succinctly, "Fear and abuse and spreadsheet hacking doesn't help people be creative and share ideas[.]"

Greater art would come if most of us aren't so desparate to get by nor
meeting some impossible metric. To me, though, great art gets around
money---it just can't be bought. It can only be copied, transformed, or
transmuted to influence other creations, to start a movement maybe.

On that note, the greatest performance art, perhaps, is communities of
*artists* [coming together to help each other](/mutual-aid) out of this
cultural, systemic mess we find ourselves in.

## Why or How to Art?

I don't know exactly, except maybe it's a human thing to express oneself
in ways alleviate the daily struggles...?

Maybe, my art does not necessarily reside in th visual aspect, but more
on the acceptance of [chaos](/chaos) and impermanence, both of which are inherent
in this universe. I get my inspiration from each. I imagine some street
artists do the same. They have accepted these factors play into their
art. And yet, they will still go to great lengths to place their work
somewhere that the general public can see and experience.
