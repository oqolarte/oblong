Like most of our personal belongings,
bikes can be an [expression of oneself](/communication).
And that expressions change.

## Maintenance Tips

Heavily influenced by https://www.bicycling.com/repair/a20012653/bike-repair-tips/

2. If it's threaded, grease it.
3. Clean bike before adjusting it.
4. Know how to change a flat.
5. Nylon tire levers are better than metal ones.
6. Measure twice, then cut. This goes for steerer tubes and integrated
   seatposts.
7. When disassembling something, keep track of the order in which you
   remove parts. It takes the mystery out of putting it back together.
8. Check tire pressure before every ride, especially if you’re running
   tubeless.
9. The three most important tools to have on a ride: a multitool with a
   chain breaker, a mini pump or CO2, and a patch kit or tube.
10. Periodically check for bearing play in your headset, hubs, and
    cranks. To check your headset, squeeze the front brake and rock your
    bike fore and aft. For wheel and crank bearings, pull the wheel or
    crank side to side. If you feel a wiggle, your component needs an
    adjustment. Don’t ignore it, or the problem will get bigger and more
    expensive.
12. Using a torque wrench, check the tightness of your crank bolts every
    month. If you just bought a new bike, check them after every ride
    for the first week.
13. Loctite Threadlocker­ Blue 242 is a must-have­ accessory for bolts
    that assemble using standard hand tools. It seals threaded fasteners
    and keeps them from rattling loose due to vibration.
14. Don't ignore the noise your bike is making.
15. A creaky crank is likely loose on the spindle. Remove the crank
    bolts, lubricate the threads, and reinstall. Tighten everything
    using a torque wrench.
16. If your saddle creaks, clean the area. Drip a few drops of oil on
    the rail where it connects to your saddle and into the clamp where
    it grips the rails.
1. Accept that you are not capable of every repair. Sometimes you have
   to take your problem to a professional.
1. Don't lie to your bike mechanic on how you broke your bike.
2. Never roll your bike into the shop and expect an on-the-spot repair.
   Bike mechanics have varying workloads per day.
1. Three signs your brake pads are worn: You hear a gritty scraping
   sound, the grooves in the pad have all but disappeared, or you feel
   stickiness when you brake.
2. Don’t touch disc-brake pads with your fingers. The oil from your skin
   can decrease their braking power.
3. Work on one brake at a time so you always have an intact brake to
   reference.
4. If you’ve been running bolt-on brake pads and it’s time to replace
   them, now is the time to switch to the cartridge-style type. The next
   time your pads need replacement, you can simply slip them into the
   holder, no alignment needed.
5. When replacing a brake cable, initially adjust it so the pads are
   fully against the rim, then squeeze the brake lever as hard as you
   can a few times to release slack in the cable and compress the
   housing. Repeat these steps until you don’t feel the cable and
   housing give anymore. Now adjust your brakes the way you want them to
   feel.
6. Use sandpaper to roughen up glazed brake pads.
7. Do not use a solvent to lube your chain.
8. Schrader valves are similar to the ones found on your car; Presta
   valves are thinner, with a small nut that has to be opened prior to
   inflation.
9. Places where grit hides: in brake pads, between tubes and tires, in
   cleats and pedals.
10. If a carbon part moves when it’s not supposed to, it can get
    scratched or trashed.
11. If you pinch-flat often, the PSI (air volume) in your tires is
    almost certainly too low.
12. If you store your tools in a toolbox, color-code them with their
    corresponding drawers or slots. If you have a pegboard in your shop,
    trace each tool in the spot where it hangs. Everything will be
    easier to find.
13. When you disassemble something complicated, use your smartphone or
    digital camera to document the process. If you end up with an extra
    part after reassembly is complete, you can look back at your pics to
    figure out when and where things went wrong.
14. Never turn your bike upside down to work on it. You could ruin
    cables, accessories, even your saddle. If you don’t have a repair
    stand, find a way to suspend it.
15. Blasting your bike with a high-pressure hose forces in unwanted grit
    and dirt and blows out much-needed grease and lube. Use a bucket of
    water and a sponge instead.
16. Use rubbing alcohol to remove black grime from your rims.
17. When your chainring teeth start to look like shark fins, it’s time
    to replace your chainrings.
18. Chains and cogs wear together.
19. To tighten a loose headset, loosen the stem, tighten the top cap,
    and retighten the stem.
20. Installing new pedals? Make sure you thread your left pedal into the
    left crankarm and your right into the right (they should be marked).
    If you inadvertently interchange them, you will likely have to buy
    new crankarms. The good news is that your pedals will probably
    survive the mistake.
21. To remove your ­pedals, set the driveside crankarm at 9 o’clock for
    better leverage. Then turn your wrench clockwise to loosen your
    non-driveside pedal and counterclockwise to loosen the one on the
    driveside.
22. Don’t adhere a patch to a tube until the glue you applied goes from
    clear to cloudy.
23. For fewer broken valves, inflate your tire with the valve stem
    facing down, between 10 and 2 o’clock.
24. Hang hooks in your garage to keep your bike ­vertical. Resting it on
    its side can knock your derailleurs out of whack.
25. Regularly inspect your carbon-fiber frame for cracks, and touch up
    scratches with a couple coats of clear nail polish.
