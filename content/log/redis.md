- Added new sections to the [Server]({{< ref "/project/server.md" >}}) project.
Still haven't gotten around to it, but I will soon.
I have to, now that I have a domain.
- Added Paypal link in my [Support]({{< ref "/support.md" >}}) page.
Also inserted a better pitch in there.
- Edited a footnote in the [Site](/site) project.
- Minor edit of the footer.

In a society much better than this one, many things are readily available to everyone.
People meet their basic needs.
I imagine they are freer in their actions, in that they don't (need/feel the need to) limit others' freedoms.
But this isn't that society.

In the meantime, support the people you want and can, in any method, legal and/or moral, you know how.
*Redistribute* everything else accordingly.
