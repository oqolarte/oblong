In radical spaces, well-versed hot takes might indicate the sayer has
good [politics](/politics). But surely, that's not the only way to
participate in daily politics, right?

## Toxic activism

Misplaced wokeness has toxified activism.
It becomes a performance,
rather than the Thing that should be done.
Bigger, more mainstream movements,
with charismatic people at the helm,
often tokenize marginalized people to further the agenda.

In reality, there are many forms of activism,
and it doesn't have to burn anyone out.
It doesn't necessarily have to put oneself on public display,
especially when one doesn't want a large target on their back.

It can be [a secret act that sabotages](/sabotage) the flow of profit
from workers' labor into the elites' pockets.

But all the same,
living the [revolution](/revolution) is actively practicing
the beliefs in the here and now.

[Activism can and should at times make us feel alive](/joyful-militancy),
physically,
emotionally, socially, spiritually. Otherwise, what's the point?

## Mindfulness in radical spaces

As a cishet male, I must be mindful whether I am taking up valuable
space and time from those I share them with. Some points to consider:

- Am I making the space safer for neurodivergent people? If not, what
  are the ways that I can actively make that happen?
- Am I advocating for violence when it comes to dealing with those who
  do not share similar politics? If so, how does that affect
  the people I'm sharing the space with who may not be as eager?
- Am I or someone in the space is a serial rambler? If so, how can we
  moderate this as a group? Can we as a group ensure that participants
  have an equal amount of air time when voicing their thoughts?
