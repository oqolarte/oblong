Today, I finished my first run of the game *Disco Elysium*,
a detective RPG designed and written by an Estonian novelist,
[Robert Kurvitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kurvitz),
with art direction by [Aleksander Rostov](https://rostovjanka.artstation.com/),
and music by [British Sea Power](https://seapowerband.com/).

And it's great!

I'm sure there are more coherent, well-written reviews out there.
Below is list of my own takes (with mild spoilers?)
on the game so far.[^review]

## Review of the game

### Music

As with all media,
music helps set the atmosphere.
DE ensures that each location has its own ambient music.
This matters because when done correctly---and
the devs have done it correctly---it
amplifies the emotions in important moments.

### Prose

The game is rich in prose.
It's so purple, I chew it with my mouth,
*and* listen to its wine-poisoned melody.
Too rich for some, maybe,
but I find it refreshing
in that it's unlikely a modern gamer has experienced anything like this.

The weaving of multiple languages,
including some new fantastic combination of syllables,
with English as its skeleton,
will stimulate any linguists in the crowd.

DE is a dialog-based choose-your-own-adventure book-turned-video-game,
so the most action that the player would see is the running around.

In fact, if you'd say,
"I'd rather read a novel than play this 'video game'"
I wouldn't blame you.
I might even nod in agreement.

So, go ahead and read.
I hope your novel has great visual art that goes with it.

Read---*along* with the narrator.

### Voice Acting

I could be wrong,
but it certainly *feels* like a big chunk of the budget went into VA.
Such speculation makes sense---how
else can storytelling be more compelling if not told
by someone with a deep voice?

[Lenval Brown did most of the narration](https://www.pcgamer.com/we-talk-to-disco-elysiums-incredible-narrator-who-recorded-350000-words-of-dialogue-and-has-never-acted-before/),
and to be that defining voice of the game
gave the purple-prose narrative a melancholic yet soothing vibe.

It's nice to listen to different textures in the dialog,
to pick up the subtle differences in the voices,
but some exchange can get boring, for me at least,
especially those info dumps that let you in on the world
through the protagonist's perspective.

Still, if your type of adventure is an interactive podcast,
you'll love DE!

### World Building

DE builds the world of Elysium with believable realism.
It even includes complex socio-economic and -political themes,
drawing from real-world philosophies and ideologies.

[From Kurvitz in an interview](https://web.archive.org/web/20201202012348/https://zaumstudio.com/2017/03/31/the-hungarian-interview/):

> It has geopolitical credibility.
> In this world there are states, nations, boring political parties, NGOs,
> and defunct monarchies hanging on to tabloid media to maintain the final threads of relevance.

In this work of fiction,
absurdity is tastefully blended in,
so the player really has to pay attention,
lest the plot confuses them quickly.

When that happens,
it helps to step back and let it simmer for a while.
It can get pretty heavy on details so no one is advised to speedrun this thing.
It's a long game that won't unfold on the first few hours of gameplay.

Take your time.

Get some rest and internalize.

### UI/UX

User interface does not get in the way of storytelling
with it's clean yet oil-painting based design.
When coupled with interesting mechanics,
it offers the player a billion and one ways
to explore this D&D.
That's *death & decay* for you, dungeons & dragons fans.
Or *drama & deduction*.

If I were to nitpick, though,
it can be awkward 0.1% of the time.

### Heavy Themes

DE confronts the player with notions like self-destruction,
alcoholism, and drug abuse,
and---no joke---may actually be triggering for some who might be going through a
similar phase in their life.
More than just plot devices, these themes are there to explore
how one's actions and decisions affect oneself as much as the people around.
Choosing one's annihilation is a personal verdict, yes,
but it's a choice that cannot happen in a vacuum.[^nil]
I remind myself this during those times when the Void pops in my orbit
for no reason.

There are more heavy themes, including,
but not limited to,
failed revolutions,
poverty, etc.
I won't discuss them further lest I spoil the experience.

## When Capitalism, *ofc*, shows who's Boss

TL;DR: ZA/UM Studio kicked out the original creators of the DE,
as outlined in this [Reddit post](https://old.reddit.com/r/DiscoElysium/comments/11tvv9f/whats_the_big_deal_its_just_a_photo_mode_a_short/).

I just finished this game today,
and now I'm met with this sad news,
which isn't even new at this point.
These happened months ago already.

Yeah, we still live in *that* reality, sadly.
One where a body of work that criticizes capitalism in an engaging way
is itself bastardized by that very system.
One that practically motivates rich people to steal works of art.
Not disco, those lot.

[^review]: These notes are based on my first run of the game.
I'm sure I'll uncover more good bits as I replay it one or a few more times in
the future.
