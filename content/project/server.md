## Status: Open {.statusOpen}

I want to host my site in a server that I own.
The server will actually be an old laptop that's just lying around here.
And it's not actually mine.
The [MSI Wind Netbook](https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/laptops/msi-wind) belongs to Isya, and I got her permission to use it for this project.
