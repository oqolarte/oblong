## Challenges in local DRRM planning and implemmentation

### Attitude towards disaster

Many of us think that so long as calamity far out there and does not
directly impact us, it is neither our problem nor our concern. This is a
dangerous behavior. We don't need to experience catastrophes before we
can take action and participate in risk prevention and/or reduction.

This procrastination is a major challenge because it involves changing
behaviors through education and information drives.

It's important to let the communities know that climate change is real,
and with it comes extreme effects.

### Institutionalizing DRRM

Incorporating DRRM in a community's daily life is another layer of labor
that not many is geared yet to undertake. There is no one solution to
this. It will take everyone's collective effort and participation to
ensure that when the time comes, each member of the community can help
others to the best of their abilities.
