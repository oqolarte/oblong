- Started a new project, [iPod with Alpine Linux](/alpod), an attempt to
  sync music between iPod and an Alpine Linux machine, if possible.
- Added entry to [EDP](/edp/#day-3).
- Edited [FOSS](/foss) to add a music player.

*Hideous towns* is a song that I really like from The Sundays. It
captures the alarming feeling of current state of affairs, while still
feeling overtly jolly, because isn't that a proper way to cope with
life's lemons?

My gaze from within the old house stretches to the street level, into
the neighborhood that seems tight-knit but quite literally feels and
smells foul. I hate to think that the only saving grace are the trees,
ever so majestic and wise. The foulness, however, has crept in, the
hatred of which is focused on chopping down our tree friends in the name
of "safety" and/or "progress".

As I sign off for the night, the air feels more like
*The Pecan Tree* by Deafhaven.
