A brute force attack is a trial-and-error process of discovering
[private information](/privacy).
There are different types of brute force attacks that
malicious actors use to guess passwords, including:

- **Simple brute force attacks**. When attackers try to guess a user's login
  credentials, it’s considered a simple brute force attack. They might
  do this by entering any combination of usernames and passwords that
  they can think of until they find the one that works.
- **Dictionary attacks** use a list of commonly used passwords and
  stolen credentials from previous breaches to access a system. These
  are called “dictionary” attacks because attackers originally used a
  list of words from the dictionary to guess the passwords, before
  complex password rules became a common security practice.

Using brute force to access a system can be a tedious and time consuming
process, especially when it’s done manually. There are a range of tools
attackers use to conduct their attacks.
