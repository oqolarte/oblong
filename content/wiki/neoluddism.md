## Themes:
- Inclusivity and accessibilty in [tech](/technology)
- Luddism
- [Privacy](/privacy) and surveillance
- scaling down technology's climate impact

## Abstract:

In this article, I aim to talk about my personal experience using neat
tools in FOSS, how it affects my regular choices when obtaining a new
piece of technology, when going about my daily life, and how it might
(or might not) affect the society at large, especially if it is to be
pitted against the "convenience" delivered by Big Tech products and
services, all within the context of where I live in, the so-called
Philippines.

## Talking points?

Free and open source software (FOSS), especially when I don't have a
background in software engineer, is a niche of a niche in a developing
country like the so-called Philippines, kind of like riding a
singlespeed fixed-gear bike with at least one brake (I have two, front and back, "just to be safe").
And that tiny space is not
claustrophobic (both in FOSS and in my fixie example) because it is more of a rabbit hole
leading to other interesting fields, which I
might not have reached otherwise.

In the so-called Philippines, if one could even afford a personal
computer (PC), one would expect Microsoft Windows is the operating
system, unless they are rich enough to opt for a Macbook, in which case
they have macOS. But with the wider accessibilty and more affordabilty
of smartphones, many people are content with just these mobile devices
for their computing needs. And who would not love having their own
portable PCs in their pockets that, for as cheap as a *very* light
snack, can have mobile data to connect it to the internet?

Sadly, smartphones, and most of the applications in them that has
internet-access, have little to no incentive to respect the
owner's privacy, defaulting to collecting as much personal data as it
can send it to companies for further analysis. They analyze these
aggregated data to serve their users with personalized ads, which in
turn would retain them on the platform, so they could gather more
data, and the cycle continues. At one point in this
country's electoral history, Cambridge Analytica helped elect Rodrigo
Duterte, our Trump homebrew but laced with more Chinese
Communist Party spice than Trump himself would have liked.

I am not saying that smartphones are bad; they are merely high tech
tools that can do many things at once, like connect people across huge
distances without having to sell kidney. And for many things, they are
great! I, for one, need a smartphone if I were to continue having
private and secure communication with end-to-end encryption with friends
and family, which, to wit, cannot happen on basic and feature phones.
What I'm saying is, Big Tech companies have had the incentive to use
smartphones as direct point to extract resources from the working class,
be it in the form of time, attention, data, or all of the above, with
which to concoct more profit-making and power-consolidating schemes.

Interestingly, both the proprietary software and hardware, especially
in the realm of smartphones, are designed to be that shiny object that
is increasingly hard to put down, easy to pick up. I know the feeling
since day 1 of me having a smartphone.

I inherited my first smartphone, a cheap one with no-name running
Android, from our [engineering] undergraduate
thesis titled, "Microcontroller-based Bluetooth Surveillance Robot Using
Machine Vision System" that my groupmates and I envisioned to "modernize
surveillance robots" with the assistance of the latest smartphone models
(serving as control and monitoring device) via Bluetooth, WLAN, and/or
Internet. And looking back on it now, kind of dystopic. But if you're an
engineering student, more so in a developing country, more so in a state
university, nothing is driven unto thee as hard as having ambition.
Without it, "Who are you?" And so the thesis projects from our batch,
and the ones that came before and after us, were nothing but ambitious
attempts: mainly to please the ambitions of our instructors and
professors who did the same with theirs, but also to have some
grand-sounding mouthful string of text to put to our CVs when we would
finally apply for jobs.

Ambition is nice, one would think, but to prop it up requires a solid
foundation. Take our aforementioned thesis, for example.
The knowledge we should have had to
make it all possible---including, but not limited to, working grasp
on *and* access to microcontrollers, some computer programming, computer
networking, basic welding for metalwork---was not even taught to us
because of lack of resources: university funding for necessary lab
equipment; more engineering instructors with the technical know-how;
personal computers and/or smartphones for students to access materials
from the internet; etc. Yet, to graduate from college, i.e., be
finally "free" and start working, we were forced to participate in this
culture of ambition---a common theme in Silicon Valley tech startups, I would find out later---instead of maybe looking into the intersting ways appropriate
technology or permacomputing can affect our lives using existing tech.
And to particiapte,
many of us, our team included, had to outsource the technical aspects of
our theses that we knew nothing of to an enterprising group of
tech-savvy people whose business is/was to design and build college students'
"vision" to life. It was not affordable *at all*. Side note: I don't know if
that particular business is still operating, though I suspect that if
you ask any graduating engineering student from a relatively reputable
engineering school, they would point you to at least one such shop.
Also, before you call
me out on violating academic integrity, please check your privilege;
"cheating" is nasty and I don't condone it, but it has been a way of
students to escape the unfairness and injustice that's innate to our
current education system.

I briefly talked with such enterprising tech-savvy people, and at the time, they
were visibly unexcited with the work even if it were for, I think,
decent money.
Much, much later, I would realize under
different circumstances why: *work* is flipping work, an elaborate fuckery
compounded by misuse of tech, that I would rather not engage in. But I digress.

I digress.

My first smartphone was so cheap it was a hard tap away from being a
glorified potato. But for all its unremarkability, it did okay. It had
four-inch capacitive touchscreen, had Bluetooth, connected to wifi, and
had a headphone jack. And most important of all, it worked---our whole
thesis project worked---during thesis defense. I inherited it because at
the time, all my groupmates already had a smartphone of their own, and
definitely better than this one.

Most enterprising tech-savvy people would not want to extend software
and hardware support for it, let alone bring it back to life. I can't
blame them. Such endeavor requires effort, resources, and time,
something that many of us, myself included, would rather spend on
shinier, newer, and probably objectively better things. And tech
workers, you know, have been conditioned to follow where the obscene
amount of money is. I say that last sentence not to slight them, but to
remind myself also why I am trying to shift into a tech-adjacent career
for the supposed non-trivial pay. I do wonder if I still had that potato
phone today *and* am able to do normal things like offline map
navigation or, I don't know, private and secure communications.

- Tech life after that first phone was as boring as it gets. I could
  only vaguely remember what got me into FOSS, if I'm being honest. It;s
  likely because of some random comment someone on the internet made
  about something cool, like the Tor project or, more likely, TAILS.
  Whatever it was, it was my rabbit hole into FOSS, a path that gets
  narrower as I proceed and branch off.

Many years into my FOSS journey, as niche as it is already, I have
found my friends who share the same sentiments. Unsurprisngly, we
share similar political leanings, which, let's just say, is mostly
anti-establishment. Believe it or not, one's personal politics may
contribute to how easy or hard it is to transition to using FOSS. As
an anecdotal example, I heard that authoritarian leftists  in the
country (whos politics I denounce, for the record) working underground
use a mish-mash of Linux and FOSS apps to operate, while I have yet to
hear the same thing from the State's military and police. In fact, the
latter, from I what limited info I know, scour big social media apps
like Facebook, because, to their credit, these platforms are treasure
troves for personal and/or incriminating data. All anecdotes, of
course.

- Deciding to use Linux as my main OS was a major turning point in my
  FOSS journey. And it was not done overnight. It took many months of
  [research](research): what Linux distribution (or "distro") would be the best
  starting point for those switching from Windows; what hardware would
  be best for such distro; what apps to use; etc. From what I could
  glean from those who have been here before me, the Linux landscape is
  more forgiving now compared to ten or so years ago. That means even
  when operating from a framework different than the traditional ones
  with profit incentives, FOSS (and most likely free culture) can be
  fertile ground for innovation and development. The fruits of labors of
  all developers and designers *will* reach the masses, if they have not
  already, and everyone will be able to use them for their daily
  computing needs, no matter the complexity.
- Getting into FOSS has made me see that beneath the software, is a
  bunch of semiconductors and metal that does the computation.
- This has intensified my support for the our right to [repair](/repair)
  the devices we own. Software depends on the hardware, and maintaining
  the latter is just as important as that of the former. Repairing stuff
  is not a radical concept for me. Not because I have a degree in
  engineering, although that helped; but because the overall climate in
  which I have lived in. In developing countries, repair is just a way
  to extend an object's life; repair is not necessarily seen as a
  political act, just another service that someone might offer that's
  less expensive than buying a new object. Here, technicians for all
  kinds of tech are abundant, at least in major city centers; and so
  having one's broken stuff will not break bank.
- Still, when I read about how Big Tech overseas design their products
  with planned obsolescence, I wonder what kind of world do the top
  stakeholders of, say, Apple, imagine when they ship AirPods, which,
  according to [iFixit's Airpods Repair](https://www.ifixit.com/Device/AirPods) page, scores *zero* out
  of ten in terms of repairability.
- The wastefulness of Global North negatively impacts the overall
  quality of life for those in Global South. Yet, while the pressure
  should be applied more on the former, it is in all our best interest
  to keep things functional for as long as we can maintain it that way.
  The least we can do is to wear them down until they can longer be
  fixed. Not only that, it's also in the best interest of our
  environment, to not just throw away broken things without even trying
  to repair them. That way, we would not have to be digging up earth for
  precious metals or cutting down trees for wood, or pull crude oil for
  plastics, or you know, extract and exploit labor from the Global South
  for all the other things that make a tech product exist. Here I say
  "we" and "our" because of course it is a collective, global effort.
- STEM makes great strides forward. People continue to make better
  technologies to improve our quality of life. It affords us a degree of
  convenience. But there can be such thing as too much convenience.
  Having this, we risk losing our ability, our love even, for problem
  solving which we would leave to those who know how, lest we think
  critically. And thinking critically is inconvenient, no? We place too
  much value on convenience at the expence of other lives, even of our
  lives; we just do not know that yet. I know there are a lot of boring
  and menial work that we would rather outsource to the machines, but it
  is easier said than done. For example, recall the humanoid bots at the
  Tesla event last October 2024, after which TechCrunch reports: "[Tesla Optimus bots were controlled by humans during the ‘We, Robot’ event](https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/14/tesla-optimus-bots-were-controlled-by-humans-during-the-we-robot-event/)."
- Can we look beneath the UI or UX design and possibly determine the
  intention of its creators?
- How does FOSS stack up to these?
- Currently, I am *trying* to pivot into a career path that ensures
  privacy and security of people, with the hopes of
  one day giving back to my communities. The technological landscape of
  the future is too murky to be left alone to the surveillance of states
  and corporations. And I'd rather be the tech worker that sides with
  the working class, not as another pawn of the capital to further
  enrich them. In reality, though, it would take more effort to sustain
  that.
- If Luddites smashed the looms as a protest against their working
  conditions, what does it mean to be a neo-Luddite? To me, it means
  using a wide range of tech---from the simpler Unix command line tools
  to the more complex self-hosted open source large language
  models---NOT to serve the already huge conglomerates whose state
  agents' boots are upon our necks. The proverbial smashing part might
  mean using FOSS and/or pirating corporations' proprietary tools to
  undo their machineries. In any case, I see Neo-Luddism as their
  planned obsolescence, the planned part executed through riotous
  collective bargaining, a two-prong approach of offense and defense
  that will render the ruling class no more. While smashing the
  proverbial looms is a cathartic option, an alternative for the
  neo-Luddites would be to instead repurpose them into something that
  may or may not have an inherent Productive Value.
