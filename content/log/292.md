## On some restless nights

Wandering mind thinks molding thoughts it randomly finds and latches
onto is pottery sublime, when it actually looks and feels and reads like
poor poetry peppered with peer-refused promises. Human mind, while not
an accurate recorder of experience, is a creative one.

## LLMs are neither psychiatrists nor friends

I recently learned some peers in my orbit are using LLMs, particularly
ChatGPT, to "exchange ideas with," and not in a healthy way.

One was (is?) using it to [psycho]analyze whether they were being
gaslit. They would copy sections of their chat with people and paste it
as input to ChatGPT, and would order the LLM to, I don't know, look for
patterns of abuse? I reached out to this specific person and politely
nudged them to talk to their friends instead of ChatGPT. But since I
don't know their whole context, I did not press on. To this day, it
bothers me that such is already happening in real time.

There is a lot to unpack here, which I admit is out of scope of this
post. But off the top of my head, mental healthcare is expensive, and
people are feeling more isolated despite being more connected. LLMs like
ChatGPT have working free tiers that mimic human conversation in a
believable enough way that people would rather talk to it. It might be
more convenient, but is it worth it at cost of a golden path to
psychosis?

## Ankle-deep floodwater in the house

{{< figure src="/image/baha.jpeg" alt="Image of a living room that has about ankle-deep of floodwater from a torrential rainfall. Books are piled up above two different tables. A few debris are floating on the water." caption="Save the books!" >}}

And so it was when we experienced 141mm worth of rainfall within an
hour that the floodwater came in our house, not to deal major damage
(thankfully), but to be *gentle* reminder of the things we need to do as
the climate crisis is becoming more apparent in our communities.
