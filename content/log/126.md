When I started working remotely at the onset of COVID Pandemic 2020,
it enabled me to do my job at my own pace,
no longer anxious whether someone is watching me.
But the worry of surveillance was replaced with the worry of getting
sick.
Then and now,
I can't afford to get COVID,
and I'm relatively healthy.
The effects of long COVID are nothing to laugh at.

I often question the relevance of both public and private sectors
pushing people to go back to the office (on-site) when,
for a few years now, it's possible to deliver outputs from home,
not despite of, but especially because of,
this non-traditional work setup.
And I often reflect on whether I'm looking at it
from pessimistic angle.

It doesn't help that people, mainstream media included,
get it wrong when they misinterpret World Health Organization's
declaration (WHO), [last 5 May](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1654477334139863041), that COVID19 is over *as a global health emergency*.
That last part is important.
What WHO meant is that, they're now shifting to long term strategies
to mitigate the harmful effects COVID as it goes on,
because the developed countries failed to contain it.
We can't celebrate when everyone collectively failed to care enough.

This log offers no solution,
and merely is a rant.
