## So-called sustainable mining

How do proponents of so-called "sustainable mining" claim that the
entire process is actually sustainable? Does the phrase even mean
anything outside of [greenwashing](/greenwashing)?

When natural habitats are destroyed, communities displaced, and
activists are threatened with harm and [violence](/violence), can we
trust the State and/or Corporations to keep us safe?

I would be more interested if, in the spirit of having their [skin in the game](/skin-in-the-game),
believers would be physically on site where so-called sustainable mining is on-going,
live there for at least a year, and report back to me.

I would want them to explain to me
in plain, everyday language---devoid of marketing and corpo
bullshit---that what they would be seeing, smelling, hearing, feeling,
and even tasting (in the air, in the food they would eat, in the water
they would drink) during their stay there are the result of first-hand
experience.

I want the laborers from the mining companies to believe it
to be true.

I need to hear the communities that still live there that
the mining is indeed a "green transition", however they understand that,
if at all.

I must see the plants and animals thriving, not despite but
*because of* this sustainable mining.

## Cynical towards mining

I have yet to hear or know of a mining company that gives back to the
community more than what they have taken from it. In
[Congo](/cobalt-in-congo), there are countless of deaths that go
unreported in cobalt mines.

I'm cynical about
[Maharlika fund](https://www.mic.gov.ph/) loaning around US$ 76.4 million to Makilala Mining in
Kalinga Province (here in the so-called Philippines). The latter, in
doublespeak, claims that the loan would fund "responsible mining." See
these news articles:
