In a dream one night, I found myself in a knife fight with a tall
white British loser-back-home vacationing here where I live. He was
harassing the girl I was with. Not sure who "won" the fight, but it is
these moments of martial arts-induced haze that I look inward for a
motivation to get out of my rut and maybe sign up for a crash course in
Muay Thai.

It is becoming harder to describe the flow of days, except it is a
constant fight for life, against the necropolitics.

Work continues to be just out of reach. As a consequence, I am hounded
by things I have yet to unlearn, one of which is the need to be
productive by being in the workforce.
