Math is beyond just studying numbers.
It's applications are everywhere,
including data science and [cryptography](/cryptography) and
[machine learning](/ml).
Although many mathematicians just study and research pure math just for
the sake of it.

It's also a field filled with "drama."

People's aptitude for mathematics can be influenced by a combination of
factors such as inherent cognitive abilities, early exposure and
education, motivation, and problem-solving skills. Some individuals may
have a natural affinity for logical thinking and abstraction, making
mathematical concepts more intuitive for them. Additionally, early
positive experiences with math and [effective teaching methods](/pedagogy) can play a
crucial role in shaping one's mathematical abilities.

## Beautiful Formulas

More than numerals and symbols,
these are art works in their own right.
There are many of them,
as curated by mathematicians all over the world.
Below is a list of what I like but don't necessarily understand.

- [Pythagorean theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem)
