[Transformative justice](https://transformharm.org/tj_resource/transformative-justice-a-brief-description/)
(TJ) is a political framework and approach
for responding to violence, harm, and abuse
that's very different from the current carceral systems in place.
TJ aims to not reproduce the [violence](/violence).

## Apologies, Reparations

When you make an apology, it doesn't belong to you anymore. It's up to
the party you've wronged whether to forgive you, and you have to be
prepared for whatever response.

Don't apologize to get forgiveness. That's not an apology but a
transaction. Recognize the mistake you made and the damage you did, try
to lessen the damage, and make sure you don't make that mistake again.
Expect nothing in return for this work you must do.

## Facing discomfort

To realize the impact of your own harmful actions can be heavy and
uncomfortable; and owning up to it is only the first step.

If, let's say, you violated someone's [consent](/consent) and you the
harm-doer are the one feeling worse, the least you can do is to
apologize (see previous section).

If you have ever hurt or harmed anyone, healing cannot begin by escaping
accountability just because you don't like the uneasy feeling of facing
the consequences of your action.
