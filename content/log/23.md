- Edited some sections in the [Site](/site/).
Also, I just learned that when writing in Markdown, I didn't have to put the footnotes at the end of the document!
When Hugo converts `.md` to `.html`, it automatically places them at the end...?!
- Edited a line in [Imbentori](/imbentori/).

In Recent Years, I always dreamed of having a vague title for myself, like Designer or Consultant.
Something that I can claim.
Or something that I can only hope to be, depending on who's asking.

But never Influencer, yuck!
Although, when you think of it, one (in)directly *influences* people, places, and/or things when one *designs*, or when one is *consulted* for their expertise.
In reality, my dislike is more directed towards self-branded Influencers who flock social media like Instagram and/or Tiktok.

Now, that's not to say I like having a title. 
Filipinos, especially, like to have so many titles affixed to their legal names.
Who can blame them when doing so gives the illusion of having more opportunities?
