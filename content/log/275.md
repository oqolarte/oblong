I have been waking up early to warm mornings.

Some days, I manually grind coffee beans for breakfast. This is the only
"grind" I abscribe to. *Pero sa Tagalog, siyempre gumigiling pa rin
ako.*

When I am able to resist to pick up
the phone first thing, I "talk" to authors (i.e., read,
reflect, and make notes) as I glean from their theories and
praxes, and [share what I learn](/wiki) to [friends and family](/friendship).

I find that engaging in this spiritual conversations with authors, near
or far, living or dead, are more fulfilling than loading my mind with
rage in vivid colors from the internet so early in the day.

(Nothing wrong with being mad in a world where there are so many legitimate
things to be mad about, but it is unhealthy to be in that state all the
time.)
