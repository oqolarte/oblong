Abstract:

In this article, I aim to talk about my personal experience using neat
tools in FOSS, how it affects my choices when obtaining a new piece of
technology, and how it might (or might not) affect the society at large,
especially if it is to be pitted against the "convenience" delivered by
Big Tech products and services, all within the context of where I live
in, the so-called Philippines.

Talking points?
- Use of FOSS is a niche of a niche in a developing country, I would
  say. Windows is expected as a computer's operating system, unless
  you're rich enough to have Macbooks, then you have MacOS. Weirdly enough, though, I have found my friends who share the
  same sentiments. Unsurprisngly, we share similar political leanings.
- Deciding to use Linux as my main OS was a major turning point in my
  FOSS journey. And it was not done overnight.
- Using FOSS intensified my support for the right to repair the devices
  you own. Before FOSS, having my devices repaired when they break down
  is just a normal thing for people in developing countries. Here,
  technicians of all kinds of stripes are mostly accessible and are abundant. Getting into FOSS has made me realized that beneath the software, is the metal, the hardware that does the computation, and that Big Tech are lobbying for its obsolesecence.
- What is the drawback for using convenient products? Can we look
  beneath the UI or UX design and possibly determine the intention of
  its creators? How does FOSS stack up to these?
