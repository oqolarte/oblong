- Updated [list of future projects](/di-why).
- Updated the Preface  of [Imbentori](/imbentori).
FKA as Foreword, which I recently found out that I misused;
Preface is more apt since it's written by the author (me).
- Updated [Blogroll](/blogroll).

Jidoka (自働化), or automation with human touch,
is typically associated with lean manufacturing.
It allows the machine operator to stop the flow line
so that defective pieces will not move to the next station
until the problem is fixed.

Can this principle be used within the confines of human mind,
as in when one imagines new infinities out of boredom?

I imagine; therefore, it's possible.

So much can be said about automating stuff nowadays.
When it comes to machines, it means speeding up the task
while producing consistent output.
Applied to the fleshy psyche, though... now, *that* can be interesting.

You don't see me succumbing to the less obvious disintegration
of internal pipes as they burst with rising pressure.
The implosion is contained,
and most likely, has no lasting dread.
That's to say,
I will continue curating ideas as they come to me,
and I to them.
