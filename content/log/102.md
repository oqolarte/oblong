- Edited [the project incubation list](/di-why).

Almost as if clockwork,
I got my annual flu some time last week,
which lasted a few days and rendered me almost useless.

There's no official diagnosis,
sad to say, because I didn't have the luxury of strength nor resources.
But it felt like common flu.

It's also because of the rain.
Southwest monsoon, locally known as *habagat*,
partnered with a low-pressure area
has been triggering heavy downpour,
causing floods all over the cities.
