- Added two [new](/edp/#day-7) [entries](/edp/#day-8) to EDP.

I can almost pinpoint with great accuracy and precision the root cause
of what I have been feeling recently, and it has something to do with
the conditions I am finding myself in on an everyday basis; the
environments that shape the spaces that I have to choose not to reshape
back, because reasons.

My recent bike rides have been liberating me from this... terrible
feeling. The most recent ride is through a torrential downpour, and
despite all that hazardous wetness, I felt free and, with my index
fingers feathering the brake levers, safe.
