Humans are naturally trusting and emotional, nothing wrong with that.
The current systems in place also have made sure that are conditioned to
respect authority. Bad actors use social engineering to get what they
want, usually a piece of information like a password, by manipulating
your emotions through [communication](/communication) to gain something:
a private information, access, or valuables.

Attackers also exploit the fact that more and more people are choosing
convenience over privacy and/or [security](/security).
This shift in preference may lead to increased vulnerability,
if people do not examine the tools or services they are using well
enough.

Social engineering can be done in a number of ways,
and the list below is non-exhaustive:

1. Emails containing links to malicious sites mimicking the look and
   feel of it, like banking sites.
2. Phone calls in which the caller would pretend to be a legitimate
   employee (e.g., a technician or service agent) of a well-known company.
3. SMS (text messages) containing links to malicious sites
4. Shoulder-surfing, or someone looking over the shoulder of another
   when the latter is doing important stuff on their device, like
   inputting a password or PIN
5. Social media phishing: A threat actor collects detailed information
   about their target from social media sites. Then, they initiate an
   attack.
6. Watering hole attack: A threat actor attacks a website frequently
   visited by a specific group of users.
7. USB baiting: A threat actor strategically leaves a malware USB stick
   for an employee to find and install, to unknowingly infect a network.
8. Physical social engineering: A threat actor impersonates an employee,
   customer, or vendor to obtain unauthorized access to a physical
   location.
