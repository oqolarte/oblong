Religion, itself, is not bad.

## Leaders and Organizations

People use religion to maintain their self-image, or at least the idea
of themselves as "good." Often, they too use it to believe that their
actions are "good" even though they are objectively causing harm.
Religious leaders and organizations who use religion as a cudgel and/or
carrot, weaponizing it against the vulnerable and using it to further
their own personal agendas Used this way, religion becomes a barrier to
[accountability](/transformative-justice).

## Religion or cult?

Our society primes us for cult abuse through everyday institutions. Any
institution that relies on us submitting to authority, dismissing our
feelings and observations, isolating us, does this. It's no
wonder there are cults across the political spectrum.
