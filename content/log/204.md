... as in, worship the good times it brings back from memories. We all
could use some happy thoughts, and if raving (sans unlisted drugs) could
help, I'm all for it. I'm sure there are songs today that could evoke
the same feeling, but no one is pulling me to the orbit where I can get
those fresh new muzak...

Of course, conjuring happy thoughts could never have dispelled the
[panic and trauma brought about by Typhoon Carina](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1965762/21-dead-after-typhoon-carina-pounds-ph-pnp).

The lines like these on the building were still in tact when we reached
the innards of that city for a long overdue appointment. This was after
eating cold soba, which wasn't so bad, filling and tasty in its own way.
This was even after the super strong coffee that we had, supposedly as a
reward for not getting caffeine into our bodies. This is even after
getting the matching tattoos in solidarity with the people of Palestine.


The lines, no matter the brute, once again I found in the underrated
streets of Makati. The city has become only familiar now through the
shape of its skyline and ways. The details can be stretched and plied
again, where it truly matters, but they have
long since been foreign to my senses.
[It's even shedding its EMBO places to Taguig](https://mb.com.ph/2024/2/8/lra-transfers-embo-barangay-property-transactions-to-taguig).

My last main anchor in that city was Lola Mila. Now that
[she's gone](/173/#farewell-lola-mila),
I'm not sure if there's any good reason
left to travel through the horrible traffic to get to that city.

Now, I can't leave this post on a dark note. So here's a quick
transition to something that's bothering me.

The persistence of mosquitoes leaves itchy points on my body, phantom
dots more like. When I swat my skin, I see no speck of blood, no dead
bug. Sometimes, I sway my limb to shoo them away; sometimes it works.
The illusion of proboscis pricking my skin is imprinted on me, no thanks
to the mind games of these bloodsuckers. Complacency on my end---where
has it ever gotten me? Whether it be via sleep or just ignorance, they
will have gotten their fix before I even realize what is happening. Like
most miracles of nature, they go unnoticed. Mostly, that is, until my
palms land squarely on them.
