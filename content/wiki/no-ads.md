People, most of us anyway, don't go out of their way and say, "Please,
give us more ads!" No, everyone (except marketers) hates ads, especially
when they are obtrusive, distracting, and nonsensical---and all of them
are. We don't care if tomorrow they would cease to exist. They belong
nowhere. São Paulo, Brazil believes in it so much, that they decided to
remove all billboards in their city through their Lei Cidade Limpa
(Clean City Law).[^sp1][^sp2]

The essence of advertising is the combination of the worst parts of
[arts](/art) and science
to "influence" a person's decision.
That's a weird way to spell *manipulate*, but okay.
If [sales and profit motivate Capitalists](/capitalism),
then advertising (or marketing,
depending on terms and conditions that apply)
becomes their tool to achieve that.

## Adverse effects ad hominem

No one is immune to propaganda. Tell the same story over and over again,
and it will become believable at one point without you realizing it. Ads
will affect *you* if/when you're constantly exposed to it.

In this interconnected society, we know that ads are everywhere we look
and listen.

To be effective, it must affect sinew and flesh. It must appeal to the
carnal, because external forces controlling the body seems to be the
trend still. And it will go on like that, so long as the desired effects
favors only the few that do the controlling.

Good: "Sex sells."

Better: Go deeper. To do that, companies pay a lot of money for
science-backed research and analytics to know how best they can sell a
*lifestyle*.[^ad1] One company even bought an entire issue of scientific
journal to do just that.[^ad2]

### All ads pollute.

We waste resources---human hours (including attention),
materials, physical and digital real estate,
tons of energy, etc.---to build an industry
of convincing consumers to buy,
to let people know that so-and-so products and services exist,
and that you can avail them for [what amounts to only] 5% discount on your first purchase.[^fine-print]

[^fine-print]: But you *have to* look for the fine print.
It says there that you must first shell out an obscene minimum amount of money.
Or that some other fees are included.
Or that the discount only applies in certain regions.
Or that there are hoops that you have to jump through,
which aren't really worth the hassle.

### All ads are fantastic

... in that all of them are out of sync of reality.
A growing number of them even *are* surreal,
an attempt to stand out from the noise
while simulatenously being it.
Fantasy, when it successfully reaches the mind,
lets us escape from our current state,
even if for a brief moment.
Ads are conveniently designed to be short and succinct.
It's the drop of poison that can still corrupt the well.

### SEO makes internet increasingly useless

The advertising industry has been burying useful content under garbage
and bad services. Take search engines for example. Search engine
optimization (SEO) has gamed algorithms, so that finding good ideas is
hard. Marketers use SEO to increase site visits which in turn increases
ad revenue. Nastier actors use it to sway public opinion!

With online advertising, they even subtract from the overall
user-experience of the internet. Embedded scripts and trackers in a lot
of modern websites drastically slow the loading time. A lot of them
collects your data, with or without your permission. Companies store
these data alongside the unique IP addresses that are used to profile
visitors.[^ad3] And let's not forget the intrusive pop-ups that are part
of the site's design, because those are never not annoying.

In our modern society, people who work in advertising, marketing, finance, and other bullshit jobs
exist for the sole purpose of manufacturing consent[^chomsky] and inventing reality,[^parenti]
and producing and selling stuff we don't need to make the rich richer.
If YOU belong in any of these fields,
please consider this:
your work enables the elite, directly or indirectly,
to keep the structures that feed off of the excess labor of the working class,
just the way they are now.
But, YOU, unlike the bosses higher up in the corporate ladder,
you're human:
air goes in and out of you.
You feel a slight discomfort in knowing the fruits of your labor.

[^chomsky]: Watch the almost-three-hour documentary version of Noam Chomsky's book: https://archive.org/details/manufacturing_consent
[^parenti]: Download the e-book (pdf) from https://pdfdrive.com.
Look up Michael Parenti's *Inventing Reality*.

Living under capitalism,
you and I are eventually coerced to cooperate,
to participate in maintaining the status quo,
lest we die of hunger or illness or despair,
or a concoction of the three.
It doesn't mean, though,
that we'll blindly accept this fate without putting up a fight.

### Trendjacking

**Trendjacking** is when a marketing team takes a trending event, likely
appropriated from social media, and spins it into a vehicle for
advertising their products. Not even events and social occourences like
*chismis* (gossip) are safe from the wits of marketing.

I don't like it, because even our collective attention, when aligned at
looking, ogling, and/or pondering at something or someone, becomes an ad
space. This means that companies are [even more incentivized to listen in](/privacy)
on us 24/7 for the latest viral eureka, to be transmuted into a
money-making tool in their already invasive toolset.

## What to do (or not do)

As mentioned, (m)ad agents pour ridiculous amounts of resources
into crafting the perfect ad material.
So don't you dare think you're immune to marketing.
Those that appeal to you,
when they reach you,
will work on you.  *Parang budol.* Targeting ads (*ha!*) and eliminating them, thus, is a necessary move against the capitalist agenda.

What follows are some recommendations that you can work with when
removing as much of it in your life.
If you have more suggestions, feel free to send them to me.

1. Secure your web browser.[^browser]
Installing ad blockers[^brave] is a low-effort, high-reward that anyone can do.
We highly recommend [ublock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/).
1. Don't use Google Chrome.
If possible, avoid Google products whenever you can.[^google][^google2]
1. If possible, [buy only second-hand products](/refuse).
Not buying new things circumvents marketing.
It also has the added benefit of being more eco-friendly.
1. Vandalism is not for everyone,
so instead, answer this as best as you can:
how can print ads, fliers, posters, billboards, and other ad materials,
be *repurposed* so that they become more useful than a waste of space?
1. The only acceptable advertisement is anti-ableism, anti-racism, anti-sexism, anti-homophobia, anti-transphobia, anti-speciesism,[^specism] anti-militarism, and anti-capitalism.
Promote these ideas whenever and wherever,
in physical and digital spaces.[^anarchy]

[^specism]: Here's an interesting thought:
why is it that "food animals,"
when used as an icon/logo/mascot to advertise their own meat,
are always smiling?

### Advanced Tips

This subsection discusses what other things you could do to remove ads,
but they're not for everyone.
It tiptoes on the line between usability and quality of experience.
Or: The tightrope oscillates between adventurism and paranoia.
Decide for yourself whether you're willing to take extra steps and make compromises, before proceeding.

6. The default operating system of your computer is a spyware.
Consider switching to Linux.
1. In Linux, use a terminal-based browser like `w3m` or `lynx`.[^tui-browser]
1. Disable JavaScript completely,
since most of ads and trackers rely on this.
The specifics vary from browser to browser,
so you may have to look up on how to do it on yours.
Note that doing this will break a lot of sites.

Sites that are neither accessible from a terminal browser
nor work with JavaScript disabled need to be heavily scrutinized as to
what they actually contribute.
There are a few exceptions, like bank-, school-, or work-related sites.

9. Set up a Pi-Hole at your home and block all ads in all of the devices connected to the network. [^pi-hole]
1. Back in the real world, install artwork that doesn't try to sell a product or service.
Conversely, uninstall/vandalize art that only tries to sell you
something.
After all, "All art is quite useless."
(Wilde, *The Picture of Dorian Gray*, 2).

that offers network-wide protection,
blocks in-app ads,
improves network performance, etc.

## APPENDIX: Art according Oscar Wilde

If ads are a perverted version of art,
then they are useless.
Oscar Wilde had had some strong opinions about art being quite useless.
This appendix contains two of them.

### Preface to *The Picture of Dorian Gray*[^dg]

The artist is the creator of beautiful things. To reveal art and
conceal the artist is art’s aim. The critic is he who can translate
into another manner or a new material his impression of beautiful
things.

The highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of autobiography.
Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without
being charming. This is a fault.

Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the
cultivated. For these there is hope. They are the elect to whom
beautiful things mean only beauty.

There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well
written, or badly written. That is all.

The nineteenth century dislike of realism is the rage of Caliban seeing
his own face in a glass.

The nineteenth century dislike of romanticism is the rage of Caliban
not seeing his own face in a glass. The moral life of man forms part of
the subject-matter of the artist, but the morality of art consists in
the perfect use of an imperfect medium. No artist desires to prove
anything. Even things that are true can be proved. No artist has
ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable
mannerism of style. No artist is ever morbid. The artist can express
everything. Thought and language are to the artist instruments of an
art. Vice and virtue are to the artist materials for an art. From the
point of view of form, the type of all the arts is the art of the
musician. From the point of view of feeling, the actor’s craft is the
type. All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the
surface do so at their peril. Those who read the symbol do so at their
peril. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors.
Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new,
complex, and vital. When critics disagree, the artist is in accord with
himself. We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he
does not admire it. The only excuse for making a useless thing is that
one admires it intensely.

All art is quite useless.

### Wilde's Letter to Bernulf Clegg[^clegg]

> My dear Sir
> 
> Art is useless because its aim is simply to create a mood. It is not
> meant to instruct, or to influence action in any way. It is superbly
> sterile, and the note of its pleasure is sterility. If the contemplation
> of a work of art is followed by activity of any kind, the work is either
> of a very second-rate order, or the spectator has failed to realise the
> complete artistic impression.
> 
> A work of art is useless as a flower is useless. A flower blossoms for
> its own joy. We gain a moment of joy by looking at it. That is all that
> is to be said about our relations to flowers. Of course man may sell the
> flower, and so make it useful to him, but this has nothing to do with
> the flower. It is not part of its essence. It is accidental. It is a
> misuse. All this is I fear very obscure. But the subject is a long one.
