- Added a site logo.
It's actually just scaled vector graphics (SVG) coded with HTML.
Experimental at the moment.
I'll likely change that into something more artsy in the future.
- Edited a few lines in the [Encoding](/encode/) project.
- Edited some parts in [This Site](/site)/ project.
I added some notes about my new found tool, [imgp](https://github.com/jarun/imgp), with the help of which I
- redid an image in [iPod Upgrade](/mercipod/) project.
- Removed the @tuta.io email from Index.
I don't know why I can't access Tutanota servers.
Something to do with my location?
In the meantime, @live.com.ph shall receive any emails. 

A day like any other.
An okay day so far for a cat named Ming to look for love (or escape from hate) beyond the walls.
A perfect time to be hounded by pressing questions like:

> What is the realistic thing to do to not go hungry and be kicked out in the streets?

The modern answer: Get a job.
I prefer "At least be useful to people," but to be honest, consistently doing that takes effort and leads to burnout.

Not at all a bad day, in my opinion.

Make a non-exhaustive list of what a bad day looks likes.
I like making lists.
Creating lists has a calming effect.
Anyway, specify a number of items in the list, that when met, will constitute a bad day.

Today is also a great day to go against the grain, to have the guts to think independently of what's *uso*.
Some might suspect its edginess, but as long as hate isn't promoted, it's fine.

Choose a simple set of tunes to spaghettify to *en plein air*, even if it's unnecessary.
