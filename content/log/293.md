## Brief review of *Candido's Apocalypse*

This short story by Nick Joaquin could not even save me from my whacked
attention span. Rich yet complex writing voice of NJ did not help either
to be honest. The first 10-20 pages might be written "overacting"
because it took me a relatively long time to go through, but again that
could just be me. Things started picking up when the POV switched to the
titular main character. Candido/Bobby's unraveling felt like Holden
Caulfield's if the latter were Pinoy and the setting were in the humid
70s Manila.[^phony]

[^phony]: Apparently, at least one other person out there share the same
sentiment. See this [Goodreads review by Julian Inah Anunciacion](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9947552-c-ndido-s-apocalypse).

NJ, when exploring questions like "Who gets to gatekeep authenticity?"
and "Who gets to gatecrash through the walls built around it?", did not
use too many big words, thankfully, unlike F. Sionil Jose who made his
prose as purple as possible, in my opinion. NJ created depth by weaving
simpler words into complex imageries.

## Attended workshop this weekend

I participated in
[MISMO](https://www.instagram.com/makeitsafermovement/)-led paralegal
workshop. The discussion included exploring different institutional
strategies for the community when responding to different types of
violence that commuters, especially pedestrians and cylists, face on a
daily basis.

In one of my presentations, I half-joked (which the audience received
well haha!) that the group I represented were just trauma-dumping apart
from sharing our frustrations with our public transportation.

One of my main takeaways: people who supposedly have been "authorized"
to help will *not* help, because it's just too much work for them.
(*cough* ACAB *cough*)
