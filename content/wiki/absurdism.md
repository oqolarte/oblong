Confronted with the [nihilism](/nihilism) inherent to life,
the obvious lack of meaning,
[the senseless cruelty and violence](/violence),
It's only natural to feel [hopeless](/hopelessness).

Even knowing this,
I try to make my own meaning in this life.
Well, in fact, I make it with the friends and family.

But absurdly embracing my life as-it-is gives me a better ability
to make meaningful change in the world,
and make myself happy, so why would I not do it?
