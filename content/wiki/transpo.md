A city should be **devoted to the pedestrians**, first and foremost.
If you see no sidewalk, claim a space for it.

{{< toc >}}

## We, the PedXing

We begin and end all of our travels as pedestrians. One would think that
it only makes sense to [design](/design) a safe communal space around
that central idea. But one need not to have lived a long life in a city
to know that pedestrians are not the priority. Somehow in the
so-called urban planning, decision-makers have thought that pedestrians
are less valuable than cars.

This is evident in the lack of proper
sidewalks. By *proper*, I mean:

- wide enough to fit at least four people standing next to each other;
- has ramps with *reasonable* slopes on curbs' endpoints for people in
  wheelchair;
- not blocked by any parked vehicle at any time; and
- not the de facto highway of skateboarders, cyclists, motorbikers,
  e-scooters, and the like.

But apart from that, pedestrians suffer the most from the [inequalities](/inequal-labor-transpo)
and injustices that cars-first culture cultivates.

## Cars-first Culture

Thanks to our friends in developed nations---special mention to you,
USA---we've developed a knack for cars. And to an extent, it's
understandable. Once a person has learned how to drive it, a car can take them
to places with relative ease, as long as there is paved road on which the
wheels shall roll. Perhaps, we have the Western [culture](/culture) to
thank for this inevitable outcome.

Many people think that having your own car symbolizes success, but does
it? I wonder whether the existence of parking lots and buildings whose
lots could have been used for greeneries and carbon sinks in urban
centers is actually a metric of success for current city planners? I
wonder if losing entire ecosystems just to pave the rich ground with
asphalt and concrete where cars could be left unproductive for long
periods of time is worth their [destruction](/destruction).

Those who can afford it will invariably use cars for their errands,
regardless of travel distance and/or purpose. To them, it's only
practical to travel in a car. But is it?

The cost of having a car cannot pay for itself,
with all the parking fees, fuel costs, maintenance cost,
time lost in traffic jams, environmental cost of burning fuel,
let alone the manufacturing of one single unit.

### What about electric vehicles (EV)?

Don't believe it when capitalists shill for EVs. They're not any better
than their combustion counterparts, in that they still require obscene
amounts of energy in order to be manufactured and operated.

Where will we get the lithium, [cobalt](/cobalt-in-congo), and other rare earth metals for
the battery if not by [mining](/mining) them from the ground, sourced most likely
through slavery in Congo?

We don't transition to clean energy by jumping into electric cars.
If anything, we only threaten our forests,[^palawan] or outsource the
pollution (and misery along with it) to some place else.

## Inclusive travel

The focus should not be in adding more roads, but in lessening (private)
cars. The former induces demand: as lanes and highways get added, so do
the number of people who want to drive on them. The latter,
unsurprisingly, has an inversely proportional effect: it makes road
conditions more desireable. Less cars also means less traffic-related
accidents.

Sure, we can rely on computing and internet to avoid traffic and/or find
the shortest route possible, but if you've driven and used Waze or
Google Maps (or some similar real-time navigation app), you'd know that
software can only do so much. An important side note: computing power
needed to operate real-time navigation apps adds to the carbon
emissions, too! Data centers that enable online GPS navigation, among
other things, still use massive amounts of computational energy, and
therefore electricty from the power grid.

## This includes rethinking air and sea travels

For many of us, our [travel](/travel) usually happens on land.
However, we face more challenges when dealing with the effects of both air and
sea travels.

### Air travel

If you can, please fly less, because aviation---including all of its
facilities---use more carbon per passenger than other modes of
transport.[^air1] That means reconsider that trip abroad: if it's for a
conference, can it be done through video call instead? If it's for
vacation, why not consider exploring our archipelago first? I'm sure
there are lots of beautiful places here that are more than just tourist
traps.

of Flying?* Treehugger. Retrieved December 28, 2021, from

Helicopters must only be used during emergencies,
when saving lives and/or preventing (more) casualties.

### Sea travel

Don't go on cruise ships. Not only is their very existence an
environmental destruction, they are dangerous places, too, where people
get food-poisoned, and possibly where a disease might infect trapped
passengers, making it a hotbed for a would-be pandemic.[^sea1]

## *Ligaw* notes:

- Cars are several layers of barrier from the outdoor elements. In order
  to achieve this individualized comfort, what have we had to sacrifice?
- Try not to buy a car. They cause pollution, directly and indirectly.
- Although details on data are sparse, it's believed that only a
  fraction of the Philippine popoulation owns a car. Yet we allot more
  of our public spaces for them by building more roads and widening
  existing ones.
- Traffic are mostly made by private vehicles, many with only one
  person, the driver, in them.

## Radical Alternatives:

- For sea travel, why not sail away?[^sea2] Our ancestors did it with
  their balangays; we can do something similar!
- Try walking if destination is within two kilometers. Depending on your
  current physique, it's probably doable up to four. As they say,
  "Everything is within walking distance." Reclaim the
  streets![^jaywalking]
- Try cycling if destination is within four kilometers. Depending on
  your bike, terrain, traffic, and/or your current physique, it's
  probably doable up to eight.
- Use public transportation. We all know that it's not the best, given
  our current infrastructure. But it does it's job okay by having the
  capability to move a lot of people using only the space required.
- Consider car-pooling with friends, family, and/or neighbors. You can
  agree beforehand how you can share for fuel and/or toll fees.
- This last one isn't really radical: if you must buy a car, go for
  secondhand, and choose reliable models with readily available parts
  that third-party mechanics can do at a more affordable price.

## Last stop

Transportation overall should be about our mobility. This includes
everything and every*one*: better infrastructures for pedestrians
(including PWDs, of course!); for people on bicycles, scooters,
skateboards, and other non-motorized vehicles; and even non-motorized
boats.

Effective---as opposed to efficient---mass transport requires us to
reimagine our movement in our spaces. Only will we all be safe in our
travels when we finally address our collective safety.

We should urge policymakers to improve our mass transportation.[^policy]
Or, you know, let's just do it ourselves.[^diy] Why wait? [Direct action](/direct-action)
always gets the goods anyway.
