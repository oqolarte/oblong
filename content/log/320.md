Took me a long while before I ventured into another Hiatus Kaiyote band.
*Moody Valiant*, without a shadow of doubt, is the good kind of trippy
jazz that I want to "start" "the year 2026" with. (The quotation marks
are there because I am rightfully reminded---by the people closest to me, and bythe God Emperor of Dune (Herbert fiction))---that it *is* hard to
experience time linearly.

However, it takes effort to enjoy the entirety of the album in one go.
That is definitely not a negative trait, but it has its time (!) and place.
