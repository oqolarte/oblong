Cascading style sheets (CSS) contains the details
used to describe how a markup language,
usually HTML,
would be presented in the web.
Thus, CSS is considered a "describing language"
as opposed to a programming language.

## Block, inline, inline-block

**Block** elements expand horizontally to take up a whole line
(like a heading).
We can apply vertical margin to these.

**Inline** elements expand horizontally just enough
to contain their content (like strong or em elements).
We cannot apply vertical margins to these
and they should usually be placed inside a block element.

**Inline-block** elements are like inline elements, but you can apply vertical margins to these (making them useful for things like buttons).
