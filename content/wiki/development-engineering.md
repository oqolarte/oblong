AKA "humantiarian engineering,"
"engineering for change,"
"engineering for impact."

Solutions are not always black and white.
Engineers should [use language and culture](/communication)
as tools for communicating our intentions.
Listen with your ears, not your mouth.
By hearing from the people instead of speaking to them,
opportunities become available.

Throughout the course of project,
create a common space for dialogue,
for sharing ideas,
to allow new ones arise,
and use them as catalyst for the community to orient its own goals.

Development engineering will always have plans and timelines change,
and things will always take longer than anticipated.
Understanding that a project will never go according to plan
[should be part of the plan](/projm).
Learning to create multiple options within the project scope,
accounting for additional time ensures that the project will be
completed in the long run.
