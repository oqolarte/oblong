Many people have now observed that technology evolves quickly
that ethics can't keep up. We don't know yet what the
implications of a shiny new thing are until it blows up, literally
and/or figuratively, and still we go on using them.

Another striking view is that even if the ethics does keep
up, no tech is completely fool-proof.
"The universe is always making better fools," says one person on the
internet.

So with the rise of mobile phones comes new quirks that are not only becoming
normal, but to my untrained-in-socio eyes are also getting vogue.
One of which is something that annoys me: people looking down on
their phones *while* walking. This bothers me verily because the
perpetrator, among many other things, expects other people to adjust
around them, as if to (unintentionally?) signal, "I don't care."
My rant/question ends with: "[Is this the Cool thing?](/146/#on-being-cool)"

Nothing new about this. There are pictures *and* videos
online of people reading newspapers and books while walking.
The handheld thing that has our attention may be different,
but the effect, I would argue, is the same.

Somehow, though, the latter is where my logic circuit shorts.
I would rather see people colliding with one another because they were
reading books rather than being on their smartphones.
I recently saw a young guy treading towards me, their eyes partly fixed
on their book at hand, before dodging me as soon as they sensed my
closing in on them.
My partner, who was with me at the time, remarked, "That
person is one of my people!"
They're mine, too.

In any case, we need to be mindful of how move in the public.
Multi-tasking is a myth.
Just as it's not recommended to text and drive,
it's not safe to walk and have your focus elsewhere.
For better or worse, we're always surrounded by mystery:
of people coming and going in waves,
of objects and non-objects popping in and out of our periphery,
of time that forces us Forward.
