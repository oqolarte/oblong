Notes on
expanding the answer to "Who watches the watchmen?" beyond "The watched."

## Surveillance tech

Surveillance technology has been creating our digital copies online.
While not our exact replicas, and for now not sentient, these copies are
in essence mirrors, as Naomi Klein argues in her book *Doppelganger*,
adding that targeting these mirrors will be reflected back to us,
possibly affecting us in real life.

These copies are made possible by [machine learning](/ml) and large
language models. Experts, including mathematicians, statisticians, data
scientists, software developers, and computer scientists continue to
refine these tools using complex and expensive computing power.

Klein likened this hoarding of our data as data mine sites, the mining
operators being the Big Tech's platforms which, in the case for the
[so-called Philippines](/pilipinas), means they are overseas and from
Global North nations. And like actual mining sites, this data mining is
catastrophe, involving multiple violations of human rights. For example of this,see Dark Reading's article "[Pegasus Spyware Infections Proliferate Across iOS, Android Devices](https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint-security/pegasus-spyware-infections-ios-android-devices)".

## Gait analysis

Gait analysis studies the manner or style in which people move for the purpose of matching one manner or style to another.

Before [computers](/computer) have been developed to
graphically/visually analyze how we walk using a video feed, we humans
have always been familiar with gaits. With the right context, somebody's
physique, clothes, and gait can be enough for this person to be
recognized, especially by those who have intimate knowledge of these
things about this particular person.

Here is a Reddit discussion on one way, specifically changing one's step
to toe-to-heel (instead of the normal heal-to-toe), to defeat gait recognition:
