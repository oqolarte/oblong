Misplaced wokeness has toxified activism.
It becomes a performance,
rather than the Thing that should be done.
Mainstream movements,
with charismatic people at the helm,
often tokenize marginalized people.

In reality, there are many forms of activism,
and it doesn't have to burn anyone out.
It doesn't necessarily have to put oneself on public display,
especially when one doesn't want a large target on their back.

It can be [a secret act that sabotages](/sabotage) the flow of profit
from workers' labor into the elites' pockets.

But all the same,
living the [revolution](/revolution) is actively practicing
the beliefs in the here and now.
