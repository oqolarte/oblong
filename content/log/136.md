## Work-related

I am in the middle of a transition,
which is always an interesting period,
not that I'm regularly in one.
Is there a term for the liminal state between jobs,
like how "sembreak" is for semesters?

As I go from Point A to B,
the work buzz decays from the drab.
To me, this is a good thing.
All falls to place neatly.
If the move is a success,
the transition will have been smooth and quiet,
like how a boring commute should be.

## On daily news

I'd like to think that I'm not sick of people.
But every time I doubt that sentiment,
I try to look back on the good things that have happened to me
thanks to a combo of right person/s and luck within proximity.

## Music

For the month of Aug 2023, these are the albums I listened to.

| Album Name           | Artist         |
|----------------------|----------------|
| Blue Planet Eyes     | The Preatures  |
| Stick Around For Joy | The Sugarcubes |
| Hatful of Hollow     | The Smiths     |
| Today                | Galaxie 500    |

Because it's the latest one that I went through,
I'd recommend *Today* to anyone who enjoys shoegazing.

My least favorite in this bunch would be *Blue Planet Eyes*
and I speculate it might have something to do with recency.
