I am writing to you from my humble corner in our home, cold December
rain humming in the afternoon background. Less than 24 hours ago, we
had just emerged from a five-day "internet outage" in our area. This was after
multiple follow-ups from our internet service provider (ISP).

I have never placed my full trust in any ISPs, even when I pay our
monthly dues in full and on time. So while it sucks to go through days
of almost-offline---because I still have friends and family to talk
to---I took it as an opportunity to actually
complete some of my smaller, personal projects.

## Replacing UV lamp of mosquito killer

Living with plants in a tropical urban environment usually means also
living with mosquitoes. We have never gotten accustomed to their
persistence, so having a mosquito lamp is a necessity.

One day, the lamp died.

Much too long after that did I only think about replacing the lamp.

When the replacement UV lamps I ordered online came, getting the busted
one out from the device was so simple, I might have needlessly overdone
it:

There really was no need to disassemble the whole unit. A latch at the
bottom simply needed unscrewing, and from there the lamp can be accessed
for replacement.

## DIY "stool stool"

[Squatty potty](https://www.squattypotty.com/)" as it's more commonly known, is a small stool-like piece
of furniture (?) placed near at the front of a toilet bowl. When sitting
on the bowl to do one's business, one places their foot on the stool.
This elevates the legs, orienting the body into a squat-like position,
facilitating a better shitty experience. Read "[What Is A Squatty Potty?](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/squatty-potty-what-is)"
at WebMD if you want a more legit explanation.

I built one out of scraps of plywood I picked up lying around the
neighborhood.

I'm thinking of making more for friends and family, but surely much
better than
*this* crude prototype.

(Side note: I should maybe refrain from getting free useful stuff, i.e.,
scrap wood, that houseless folks might otherwise obtain.)
