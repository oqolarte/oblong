A playbook, in the context of [cybersecurity](/cybersecurity), is a
manual that provides details about any operational action, such as how
to respond to a [security](/security) incident.

## Playbooks as strategy

Playbooks are accompanied by a strategy. The strategy outlines
expectations of team members who are assigned a task, and some playbooks
also list the individuals responsible. The outlined expectations are
accompanied by a plan. The plan dictates how the specific task outlined
in the playbook must be completed.

Playbooks should be treated as living documents, which means that they
are frequently updated by security team members to address industry
changes and new threats. Playbooks are generally managed as a
collaborative effort, since security team members have different levels
of expertise.

Updates are often made if:

- A failure is identified, such as an oversight in the outlined policies
  and procedures, or in the playbook itself.
- There is a change in industry standards, such as changes in laws or
  regulatory compliance.
- The cybersecurity landscape changes due to evolving [threat actor](/threat-actor)
  tactics and techniques.

One can use playbooks for:

- Open attacks
- Privacy incidents
- Data leaks
- Distributed denial of service attacks
- Service alerts
- etc.

## Incident response playbook

Incident response is an organization's quick attempt to identify an
attack, contain the damage, and correct the effects of security breach.

### Phases of incident response

1. **Preparation**: Organizations must prepare to mitigate the
   likelihood, risk, and impact of a security incident by documenting
   procedures, establishing staffing plans, and educating users.
2. **Detection and analysis**: Using appropriate tools and strategies
   during this phase helps security analysts determine whether a breach
   has occurred and analyze its possible magnitude.
3. **Containment**: prevent further damage and reduce the immediate
   impact of a security incident. Containment is a high priority for
   organizations because it helps prevent ongoing risks to critical
   assets and data.
4. **Eradication and recovery**: involves the complete removal of an
   incident's artifacts so that an organization can return to normal
   operations. Once security teams have exercised due diligence, they
   can begin to restore the affected environment to a secure state. This
   is also known as IT restoration.
5. **Post-incident activity**: documenting the incident, informing
   organizational leadership, and applying lessons learned to ensure
   that an organization is better prepared to handle future incidents.
   Depending on the severity of the incident, organizations can conduct
   a full-scale incident analysis to determine the root cause of the
   incident and implement various updates or improvements to enhance its
   overall security posture.
6. **Coordination**: involves reporting incidents and sharing
   information, throughout the incident response process, based on the
   organization's established standards.

## Forensic Case

When working on a forensic case, there are two playbooks you might follow:
1. **Chain of custody** playbook outlines the processes needed to
   document evidence possession and control during an incident
   lifecycle. This allows all parties involved to know exactly where the
   evidence is at all times.
2. **Protecting and preserving evidence** playbook outlines the processf
   properly working with fragile and volatile digital evidence. It
   likely has **order of volatility**, which is a sequence outlining the
   order of data that must be preserved from first to last. It
   prioritizes volatile data, which is data that may be lost if the
   device in question powers off, regardless of the reason.
