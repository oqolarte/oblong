Finally got to hang out with friends this weekend, and one of them
gifted a book to me, brushing off my insistence to pay for it. The book
is *Repair Revolution* by John Wackman and Elizabeth Knight, and while
this post isn't a full review of it as I've just started skimming the
first few pages, I read a line there that says something about how
convenience affects our want to repair.

I think more generally, when a form of convenience is introduced to a
system, it is gradually integrated, and people who may have benefitted
at least once from it will now take it into consideration in their
succeeding actions. It's not necessarily a bad thing, unless maybe the
loop evolves into a newer version that it becomes a bit less sustainable
because of the convenience component.

Real life examples:
1. Many people, especially if they can afford it, would prefer to own a
   car than to own a bike to get around. As policies continue to
   engineer our urban cities to be more and more car-centric like our
   friends over at Turtle Island, it would make choosing riding a bike
   harder.
2. The accessibility of mainstream social media platforms like Facebook
   allow its users to connect instantly wherever they are, as long as
   they're connected to the internet. Naturally, people seem to expect
   everyone to have an account. I wonder if opting out of these services
   is a form of privilege, a way of regaining digital silence which
   honestly I don't know whether it's a net positive.

I'm no futurist, so I'm not sure how communities would react as we
discover new ways of making our lives more convenient (at the expense of
*something*?), because my view of the future is limited to the radius of
my arm's length. Beyond that, the image breaks down to infinite
fractals. A few parts look happy and serene, but all of it is shrouded
in in uncertainty. Just the other morning, who would've thought that I
would wake up dizzy after sleeping longer than my usual number of hours?

Weirdly, I feel out of shape. Aside from the general uncertainties, I have a
non-scientific hunch that it's also be because of all the endocrine disruptors
we're releasing out there as convenience fee.
