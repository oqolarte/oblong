Anarcho-primitivism[^tal-prim] is a shorthand term for a radical current
that critiques the totality of civilization from an anarchist
perspective, and seeks to initiate a comprehensive transformation of
human life.

However, in many anarchist circles, they are frowned upon.
This is because of how their ableist beliefs exclude people with disabilities;
people with chronic diseases that only modern medicine can address, etc.

## Living in the Wild

Many could not survive in the wild; see [Christopher McCandless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_McCandless).
The problem with becoming reliant on [advanced] [technology](/technology) is
that eventually one can't live without it and would find it harder to go back to
"simpler" technology.

Modern day humans cannot replicate the stone tools of Homo erectus,
Neanderthal, or Cro Magnon without intensive training and
practice.

Flintknapping is the art of using percussive force to reduce a stone to
one which has a sharp fine edge using another stone.  Early humans had
accomplished astonishing craftsmanship of stone into tools, from axes,
to spears, to arrowheads, to knives. They could replicate the form and
efficiency of modern versions of these things using just the things
around them.

The average modern person would struggle to find and identify the
right wood to make bow and drill or fireplough to make fire.
Unless they took with them the tools of industrial civilization,
they would die trying to "live a life in the wild".

And yet, many are still doing it. And many Indigenous [cultures](/culture) still
exist. Also, there is a lot of middle ground between "making stone
tools" and "living in mechanized industrial civilization".

Christopher isn't the best example as most anarchists or Indigenous
traditionalists emphasize [community](/community). Nobody dies like him in community.
