It's about giving machines access to data and letting them learn and make decisions on their own. No manual coding of rules; the machine learns from the data.

## Main Types of ML

- Supervised Machine Learning: The machine learns from labeled data,
  with some human oversight.
- Unsupervised Machine Learning: Here, the machine dives into data on
  its own, finding patterns and insights without being explicitly
  directed.
- Deep Learning: This goes deeper into machines mimicking the human
  brain. The "depth" here refers to the multi-layered neural networks
  behind these systems.

## Fundamental Skills

ML requires knowledge in [math](/math) and computer science to make
accurate predictions in useful data.
