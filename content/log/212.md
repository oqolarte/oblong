Sometimes, I think of entering entrepreneurship in some form that I
could sustain, and gamble what little savings I have in the hopes of
making a decent money in a shorter period of time. In this scenario, the
goal is to exit the rat maze. This hypothetical thinking is not new to
me; and when it resurfaces, I find myself stocking up on ideas and how
to monetize them. I look for other people's insight on the matter; I
"pick their brain" from a safe distance.

I mentioned the word "gamble" earlier, because one would need more luck
to have a relatively successful business and sustain it for as long as
possible. When all of this is done
and the excitement has died down, I am left again with the nasty feeling
that this would be MORE WORK, which *gamble* actually comprises---you know, the very rat maze I'm claiming
to escape from.

Alas, I have always been risk averse, but not for the most common
reasons. I understand the need to break from status quo and to keep on
pushing the limits of comfort zone. Is there, then, a path that leads
away from the rat maze and is still sustainable for everyone, myself
especially?

## Music

For the month of Aug 2024, these are the albums I listened to.

| Album Name     | Artist  |
|----------------|---------|
| open this wall | berlioz |
| City Summer    | Dyalla  |

August is an interesting month indeed, and so many things are occupying
my headspace that I rarely have the time to explore new muzak. These two
new albums, though, are okay and still enjoyable in their own rights,
mostly because they do not "get in the way" and just let you be.
