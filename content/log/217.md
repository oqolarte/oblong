Exiting September. No need to humor me with *that* song title. I am wide
awake, and yet day by day, I cannot escape the feeling of exhaustion.

Entering October, or as per corpo speak, Q4 2024. Why does it feel like
summer? Is it something connected to the Philippines recently topping
the list of countries that are 
[most at-risk](https://globalnation.inquirer.net/248995/ph-still-worlds-most-at-risk-to-disasters)
to extreme natural events and negative climate change?

Where is the best place to move to outside of Metro Manila, if even such
a place exist? Somewhere not as busy as Cubao, although why am I still
shocked at the number of people in that place on weekends? I can smile
through the bustle of the bourgeoisie, but do tell me, w̰͐h̬̀er͎̫̋̉e̼ͮ
i͐s ͇ͮth̺͔͂̒e̟ͪ ̲̥̲̏ͯ͛f̼u͕̝ć̦k͚͈̞ing̦̯̲ ̳͐soi̅ͦl with thick patches of grass? I wonder if crowd
density would be more acceptable if it were proportional to the number
of trees present in the area. Yes, that would be nice: an urban area
designed as a function of the flora density in it. If the design allows
for no botany in it now or in the future, then it shouldn't be
constructed in the first place.

As for the question in the previous paragraph: A common answer might be
some place colder. No offense to Baguio---but more importantly, out of
respect for its people---I won't be visiting it in the near future, so
long as it is dealing with it's [stinking
problem](https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/09/28/a-stinking-problem-population-tourist-growth-overwhelm-baguios-sewage-system/)
on population, growth, and sewage system conundrums.

I'll pin this for later.

A colleague from Europe told me about the current gloomy weather there
and how they "could use some warmth." I scoffed inward and thought,
"Maybe we could swap weather for an hour."

I find no warmth in my recent sighs, only a glowing rage so magnificent
it might as well transmute the sand in my morning eyes to glass, yet so
tame that I can contain it as cool abstract concepts. Always burning yet
chronically chill.
