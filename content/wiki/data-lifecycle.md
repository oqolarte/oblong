The data lifecycle is an important model that [security](/security)
teams consider when [protecting information](/infosec). It influences
how they set policies that align with business objectives. It also plays
an important role in the [technologies](/technology) security teams use
to make information accessible.

In general, the data lifecycle has five stages:

- Collect
- Store
- Use
- Archive
- Destroy

## Data governance

Organizations and businesses handle massive amounts of data every day.
New information is constantly being collected from internal and external
sources. A structured approach to managing all of this data is the best
way to [keep it private](/privacy) and secure.

Data governance is a set of processes that define how an organization
manages information. Governance often includes policies that specify how
to keep data private, accurate, available, and secure throughout its
lifecycle.

Effective data governance is a collaborative activity that relies on
people. Data governance policies commonly categorize individuals into a
specific role:

- **Data owner**: the person that decides who can access, edit, use, or
  destroy their information.
- **Data custodian**: anyone or anything that's responsible for the safe
  handling, transport, and storage of information.
- **Data steward**: the person or group that maintains and implements
  data governance policies set by an organization.

Data governance policies often assign accountability to data owners,
custodians, and stewards.

## Protecting data at every stage

Most security plans include a specific policy that outlines how
information will be managed across an organization. This is known as a
data governance policy. These documents clearly define procedures that
should be followed to participate in keeping data safe. They place
limits on who or what can access data. Security professionals are
important participants in data governance.

## Legally protected information

Data is more than just a bunch of 1s and 0s being processed by a
[computer](/computer). Data can represent someone's personal thoughts,
actions, and choices. It can represent a purchase, a sensitive medical
decision, and everything in between. For this reason, data owners should
be the ones deciding whether or not to share their data. As a security
professional, protecting a person's data privacy decisions must always
be respected.

Securing data can be challenging. In large part, that's because data
owners generate more data than they can manage. As a result, data
custodians and stewards sometimes lack direct, explicit instructions on
how they should handle specific types of data. Governments and other
regulatory agencies have bridged this gap by creating rules that specify
the types of information that organizations must protect by default:

- **PII** is any information used to infer an individual's identity.
  Personally identifiable information, or PII, refers to information
  that can be used to contact or locate someone.
- **PHI** stands for protected health information.  In the U.S., it is
  regulated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
  (HIPAA), which defines PHI as “information that relates to the past,
  present, or future physical or mental health or condition of an
  individual.” In the EU, PHI has a similar definition but it is
  regulated by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
- **SPII** is a specific type of PII that falls under stricter handling
  guidelines. The S stands for sensitive, meaning this is a type of
  personally identifiable information that should only be accessed on a
  need-to-know basis, such as a bank account number or login
  credentials.
