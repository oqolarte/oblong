## Intro

Critics, including foreigners (whom I suspect are mostly white westerns
but the author was kind enough to not disclose that) and even fellow
Filipinos, see Filipinos conformity to tradition as subservience. But
many traditions do teach many things that, while many don't make sense
in our modernized society, likely has had a function to keep people in
check. Although I do think many of our values, when co-opted by
[empire](/empire), can and will devolve into toxic ways of relating to
one another. Without the need to race to the top (i.e., fame, power,
success, etc), how much of Filipino values are worth passing on to next
generations, especially when we regard them NOT with western lens?

Historically, major colonizers of the archipelago, namely Spaniards and
Americans, had to make major adjustments to our ancestors' way of living
as part or their project, demoting any traces of native values to
"primitive," "barbaric," or "backwards," making them undesirable:
- Spaniards, with their king being beholden to the pope, Christianize
  us;
- Americans, with their hunger to expand their empire, made our lands
  their politico-economic foothold in Asia, and assimilating us in the
  process.

Supposedly, we are now free from our colonizers, but that's debatable.
We still wrestle with the values they imparted on us. In wanting to gain
back our identity, we look further back into the past for lessons that
our indigenous peoples have been living with. However, the author
suggests that we fine-tune these western values to fit our native ones,
instead of just abandoning the former altogether. This has the effect
of:
1. NOT isolating ourselves away from the modern global stage
   (unfortunately shaped largely by western ideals) while
2. keeping and even strengthening our Filipino roots.

Jocano suggests the following approaches:

1. **Relearn our traditional values and practices** by:
    - unlearning that exogenous models are better than indigenous ones;
    - freeing ourselves from "exogenous blinders";
    - releasing our traditional values from our colonial (aka negative)
      mindset;
    - studying our native practices through our own lens, not that of
      western scholarship;
    - refocusing our research to spot our strengths and not just our
      weaknesses; and
    - [prefiguring](/prefiguration) with our values and practices what
      an ethical and moral [community](/community) would look like.
2. **Emphasize similarities**. To meaningfully connect with others, we
can build better bridges by looking for common denominator. I think that
many, if not all, cultures in southeast Asia are relationship-oriented,
despite the region's archipelagic geography. We have "unawa" (verb, to
empathize with those in need) for our neighbors; we emphasize
"pakikisama" (getting along) especially with strangers to possibly avoid
"hiya" (embarassment, shame); and we even have "utang na loob"
(reciprocal obligations) to give back to those who may have helped us.

## Values as an idea for Filipinos

*Kung ano ang tanaw at siyang nakikita;  
Kung ano ang nakikita ay siyang nararamdaman;  
Kung ano ang nararamdaman ay siyang ginagawa.*

(How you look is what you see;  
What you see is how you feel;  
How you feel is what you do.)

We take the values we grow up in for granted, leaving them in the
background that guides our way of living.

The author makes a case that we cannot and do not value anything that's
socially undesirable. They are our "standards of excellence" and "ideals
[we] want to achieve." "Negative values" then are actions that violate
the socially acceptable behavior justified through existing values. **So:
there are NO wrong Filipino values, only wrong uses of them.**

Our values need to have a standard, or *pamantayan* (from the root word,
*pantay*, to mean "same level"). We can look at it as such:
- Pamantayan can be codes of meanings we need to relearn and exert more
  effort to understand, so we won't be looking at other cultures' values
  system to guide our native ways of being.
- Pamantayan can be sets of rules that people can follow to avoid as
  much conflict as possible with others in the community.
- Pamantayan can direct our course of action, what to do or, more
  importantly, not to do in a given setting.
- Pamantayan is a system of relationships including all aspects of
  behavior, and how each of our behavior mingle with one another.

Q: Why do Filipinos behave the way they do?  
A: Because they observe the same *pamantayan* for doing things.

### Elements of Pamantayan

1. [Halaga](/halaga) (evaluative core) - extrinsic to importance or
   significance of ideas, objects, and people; and value judgments deal
   with what is right or wrong thing to do, actions to take, or choices
   to make.
2. [Asal](/asal) (expressive core) - a behavioral concept intrinsic to
   the meaning of actions. Acts of good will are considered good
   character. Conversely, acts of ill will are bad character.
3. [Diwa](/diwa) (spiritual core) is the essence of our collective
   sentiments as a people. Expressed in faith in a religion, and in
   sincerity to fellow humans. It is also believed to be the
   "supernatural power" that to a higher dimension, in/directly
   influencing our present and future.
