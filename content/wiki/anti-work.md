Let's define *Work* as all activity that makes profit, whether for
oneself or someone else. So this includes not only wage labor, but also
slave labor, prison labor, unpaid housework, internships, and many more
forms of self-employment, which we find doing as required by our needs
(to get by, to not be unalive, to have a decent living, etc.).

Anti-work, in this context, then means a practice that
obsoletes the need to work
(i.e., that which results to someone's profit),
like how anti-matter destroys matter.
Because we are not meant to live like this:
Grinding away our lives for the Hustle.
We are mean to live in [loving communities](/friendship)
in which we can [help each other meet our daily needs](/mutual-aid).

## Ideally, there's no need for Work

Depending on what an ideal world would be, its society no longer
believes in the value of money. Such is not our society, though, and
because of that, I am still saving what I can from my monthly salary,
going to work as often as I can, even job-hopping. It's a feedback loop
worth considering, especially if it takes up 40 hours in my week.

But since the market grows ever more competitive, it makes it harder for
us those seeking greener pastures to demand higher salary, when we don't
want to offer our services at cheaper labor cost.

Is this the ideal world? If so, then I am an outsider looking in. Yet, I
have the mind to think that this isn't the ideal conditions for 99% of
living things in this world. The 1% who controls where the resources
flow are greedy and care only for themselves. They sustain the
competition. The reward for our hard work is more hard work.

There's no excitement in working
or in looking for work---only in permanently leaving them.

[Slowing down the grind](/slow-productivity) might be a decent compromise for some,
but we must not settle on such lukewarm reforms.

Most people go to work not because they like it
but because they are coerced to it.
If it weren't their lives on the line,
these same people would likely [escape the rat race.](/personal-finance)

Repression is not a job.
But others seem to enjoy it when they say that we should
"earn a living,"
which intself is a form of gaslighting
capitalists have told us many times over
until we have internalized it.
Sometimes, though,
they innovate and [give us some free money](/UBI).
But it's not enough.

I find it cruel that our only value as living beings is in our ability
to create capital for people who don't.

[Economics](/economics) promotes a set of pseudo-scientific beliefs that the distribution of
money is fair and efficient, when it's most often the opposite.
People in power, usually capitalists, use this to justify their privilege,
how they exploit the working class,
how they plunder the natural resources for their own benefit, etc.
