- Closing the [Knowing Here](/here) project, because honestly, I've lost
  interest in it.
And that's okay---we should be allowed to shut down small personal projects
without feeling bad.
- ... and other minor code edits in the background of the frontend,
if you know what I mean.

## Thinking about the End

Amid boredom, my mind wandered---or at least I thought it did---while
waiting for things at work to pick up.

And so, like most normal people do,
I thought about death.
Or more specifically,
the age I would die,
which I can't know for sure.

This would be a worthwhile mental exercise,
I thought, and so I made an armchair research,
and these are my findings.


### Average Life Expectancy in the Philippines

As of writing this,
the current [life expectancy for Philippines in
2022](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/PHL/philippines/life-expectancy) is
71.53 years,
a 0.18% increase from the previous year.[^life]

The annual rate of increase could be because of a multitude of things,
like improvement of quality of life,
or advancement in medical science.

This also is likely to vary from year to year,
just like in the historical life expectancy data.
This is what I'll use in my amateur projection of when I might die.

### Quick Maths

Disclaimer:
This computation is just quick maths.
I'm almost certain that it's not accurate.
This was done only as a low-effort mental exercise.
But feedback, as always, is appreciated.

I opened a spreadsheet and plotted the data in a table,
like this:

| Year | Growth Rate | Life Expectancy |
|-----:|------------:|----------------:|
| 2022 |       0.18% |           71.53 |
| 2023 |       0.79% |          71.659 |
| 2024 |       0.36% |          72.225 |
| 2025 |       1.08% |          72.485 |

In the Growth Rate column, I used the function `RANDBETWEEN`
to get a random value between a range of integers,
and in this case,
0 to 123.

The formula I used for this:

```
=RANDBETWEEN(0,123)/10000
```

Or replace `(0,123)` with the absolute cell references where
you might place these values, e.g. `($E$2,$F$2)`.

`RANDBETWEEN` function only accepts integers.
So I had to use the values 0 and 123 as the lower and upper limits
respectively,
which will then be divided to 10000 to get the rate in decimal form.
Sure enough, according to the historical data,
there's at least one year when the growth was 1.230%,
while some years there had been no growth at all.

Here's a screenshot for visuals:

### So, when do I expect to die?

Assuming I'd only last until 72,
that should be around the year 2065.

But by then,
do we expect advances in technology and medicine and whatnot?
If so, I would still expect to live way into my 80s.

## Afterthought

This little exercise can't encompass all the nuances
within the research of life expectancy,
I think that needs to be stated clearly.

This doesn't account all the unforeseen tragedies and comedies of the future
that will likely affect these numbers.
But it's fun running the numbers,
at least for me,
and writing something about it.
