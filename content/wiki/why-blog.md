## Preamble

Notice the title written as a question. Like many bloggers before me, I
too am trying to answer this for myself. But unlike many of them, I do
not necessarily offer a particular set of guidelines for others to
follow. As in, this body of text does not *really* offer a concrete
answer "why I blog," if you know what I mean.

## The future is confusing

Why document [a fraction of] one's life in the digital space in the
[internet](/internet)? Is not being vulnerable to strangers sketchy
enough on its own?

For me, what if it is partly to confuse digital archaeologists, partly
to leave a mark of who I was at this point in
[human history](/human-history)? When I was writing [Imbentori](/imbentori)
many years back, my duty was mostly to myself. A few people somehow
liked some of it. This meant that I had to embed the mundanities of the
life I was logging into cryptic and  ways of the English langauge before
publishing. I churned the literal into [surreal](/surrealism) because
exposing myself out there was something that bothered me, yet at the
same time, I felt the need to unload them somehow onto a space that was
outside me. So, I aimed to distract would-be readers, while also carving
out a space for myself.

Michael Stevens (of Vsauce fame) touches upon this idea of leaving a
ghost of you[^MCR] on his video essay
"[All The Ghosts You Will Be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHd4zsIbXJ0)" (YouTube)
for the progeny. Stevens even talks optimistically about how our
excessive use of [social media](/social-media) is our way of getting
addicted to "what's next," comparing it to how humans have evolved to
feel good about exploring the unknown. Which is what gambling also
exploits, I guess?


[^MCR]: Unabashedly My Chemical Romance reference. This is my odd way of
coping with the fact that I may never get to see them live next year
(APR 2026) when they perform at the Philippine Arena.

I broadcast some of my thoughts in the internet because I might also be
exploring---who I want myself to be, who else I could be, what things
resonate with me that others might find useful, etc...

The fog of time keeps things relatively interesting, especially for the
curious ones.

## The medium

HTML, CSS, JavaScript are useful tools with which to share information
across distances between computers. They can link pages that a blogger
might want to lead the reader next. The advent of tabs in web browsers
makes this a smooth experience. One can now open a page in a new tab,
and have it load in the background as one finishes reading the current
material.
