- Finished a book and added it to the [booklist](/books)

Philip K. Dick's *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?* is a sci-fi
dystopia that tackles many things all at once.

I recently finished the book, and below are some of my non-spoiler
notes:

- With today's [tech](/technology)'s darling, [AI](/ai) still being one
  of the hot topics to talk about, I wonder if it would reach a certain
  level that it's deemed smart enough to be installed in a humanoid
  robot---an android---and we would not tell the difference?
- If AI would be the soul, what would be the flesh? Are we making
  strides in bioengineering technology that could create human-like
  flesh from, say, 3D bioprinting?
- Humankind is gradually becoming more emotionally mature as a
  collective. That's why, for example, compared to thousands of years
  before, slavery is now frowned upon. Will we reach then a future in
  which humans become smart enough yet emotionally stunted that they
  have to invent a "mood organ" to select which emotions to feel at any
  particular time, to feel some sort of enlightenment?
- I don't think not having children of my own isn't dropping out of
  humankind. There are many other ways to participate, not just in
  continuing our biological evolution.
- In the book, there are empathy tests to which suspected androids can be
  subjected to determine whether or not they are indeed one. Will AI get
  so good that it would pass such tests?
- Empire accelerates the doom of all living things regardless of their
  value in profit- and power-seeking endeavors. As long as it remains
  above us all, it is entropy's ugly form-destroying chunk.
- How does it feel to work with an adversary while taking down, or at
  least hoping to, other adversaries? Imagine no more: [life of activists](/activism) under empire is rife with these conflicts. Even so, it's important to employ as many strategies as possible, but more so, to [think beyond what lives and worlds are possible beyond the current systems](/revolution).
- Why is it that it's common for people to reward themselves with an
  expensive Thing after doing or accomplishing someting Important? To
  boost morale?
