For more than a week, days had been a blur of dread laced with a bit of
good times. Escaping dread is akin to escaping the pull of its gravity:
it's only possible with the help of external forces.

I'm still in the orbits---or they in mine---of [problematic old men](/169), and it's emotionally and mentally exhausting to deal with
them, even if it's "just" small talk. Patriarchy disallows men to process
their feelings, which is just unfortunate for everyone around those who
believe that shite. My partner observes that it's easier to burst into
rage, but it comes with a destructive cost. It's harder to remain
collected while standing your ground, but this is more sustainable in
the long run.

On other news, I rode my bike more than 20 kms south to a city of
my childhood memories, which I had trouble recognizing with all the
"progress"-induced metamorphosis, to visit a loved one who's currently
in ICU. Then, I caught with some family matters with other visiting
relatives. Finally, I met with old friends for dinner, a spontaneous
gathering that seems to happen once in a lifetime. Thanks to one of my
friends, I "rode" back home via their car, my bike cramped with me
inside. All of these happened within 12 hours.
