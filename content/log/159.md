## Thinking about food prep lately

Busyness of daily life, sadly, has the potential to chip away at
the soul, because the Grind is designed to be that way. It's becoming normal to
have no energy left to prepare my own meal. So whenever possible, I ask
for help from loved ones to do it for me.

At one point, I imagined hiring my own personal chef in the future if I
could finally afford one. I'm still thinking about it, because I don't always
dream of outsourcing my creative outlet to other people.

I don't mind waking up to a decent breakfast from time to time, though.

## Circulating FB copypasta

Despite my not being---practically---on the platform, I was notified of
a copypasta regarding Facebook (FB) and how users should do something about
their data. To my knowledge, the following is the whole copypasta text,
lightly edited to add proper punctuation:

> It was even on TV.
> Mine really turned blue. Don't forget that tomorrow starts the new
> Facebook rule (aka... new name, META) where they can use your photos.
> Don't forget the deadline is today!!! I do not authorize Facebook or
> any entity associated with Facebook to use my photos, information,
> messages or posts, past or future.
> 
> With this statement, I notify Facebook that it is strictly prohibited
> to disclose, copy, distribute, or take any other action against me
> based on this profile and/or its contents. Viiolation of privacy may
> be punishable by law.
> 
> Please abide by the law META/FaceBook.
> 
> Here's how to do it:
> Hold your finger anywhere in this message and "copy" will
> appear. Click "copy". Then go to your page, create a new post
> and place your finger anywhere in the empty field. "Paste"
> will appear and click Paste. This will bypass the system....
> He who does nothing consents.

Circulating this text on Facebook does nothing with regards to
increasing one's privacy.

In [Facebook's Terms of Service (ToS)](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/),
under "How our services are funded," they state, as of writing this
(emphasis mine):

> Instead of paying to use Facebook and the other products and services
> we offer, ***by using the Meta Products covered by these Terms, you agree***
> that we can show you personalized ads and other commercial and
> sponsored content that businesses and organizations pay us to promote
> on and off Meta Company Products. ***We use your personal data***, such as
> information about your activity and interests, to show you
> personalized ads and sponsored content that may be more relevant to
> you.

I haven't read the entire ToS, but given the platform's notorious
history when it comes to exploiting users' data, I'm almost sure that
hidden beneath the legalese and marketing terms, using their platform
means giving them all sorts of permission to use whatever FB has on you
in whatever ways they could think of.

If there's any good in circulating the copypasta, it is in making more
people aware of their interactions in the platform, and how they should
think twice before inputting their data to be fed to the algorithm for
FB's profit. Albeit ignorant, this is one way to build trust in digital
communities. Yet, at the same time, fact-checking a piece of information
first prevents circulating fear, uncertainty, and doubt
([FUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty,_and_doubt)),
which in my opinion, is a better tactic.

As for capitalists:
Just because people are not savvy enough, in terms of technical and/or
ethical know-how, when navigating digital spaces
doesn't mean Big Tech companies should capitalize on them.
We all deserve talking to each other without having to worry whether our
data would end up somewhere we don't like.

## Celebrities' Privacy

Still on the topic, I wonder if it's worth receiving
money and/or recognition for diminished privacy. Celebrities have to face
this dilemma (I think?) on a regular basis.

Maybe, reaching a level of fame short-circuits a
corresponding part of consciousness that determines one's knack to be
more performative, to transform a facet that's public-ready.
It's not necessarily a bad thing;
we need subject matter experts to share ideas to the masses,
and internet scales this exponentially.

And scale it does---with the advent of social media on the internet,
more people care more about performing for an unseen audience for
whatever reason than preserving a private life.
And again, it doesn't necessarily mean it's bad.
But when does it become so?
