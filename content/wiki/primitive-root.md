The primitive root is a number whose power (exponent) successively
generates all the elements mod *p*, except for zero.
Because it generates all the elements mod *p*,
such base is appropriate for [cryptographic applications](/cryptography).

Using primitive roots of a prime modulus *p* yields the maximim *p* - 1
possible outcome values for the [discrete logarithm](/discrete-logarithm), which is desired for
cryptography.
