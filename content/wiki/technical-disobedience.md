[Ernesto Oroza](https://www.ernestooroza.com/) coined the term
*technological disobedience*. He explains:

> As the crisis became more severe,
> people's creativity grew more powerful,
> and everywhere you looked,
> you saw solutions to the needs that people faced all the time,
> in every aspect of life.
> Transportation, children's toys, food, clothingâ€¦
> everything was replaced with substitutes produced by the people.

We could be entering a new era of censorship,
not by direct deletion of old or controversial content,
but by obscurity and omission of argument tactics.
It is not a random change.
