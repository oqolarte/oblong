- Ticked off some of the items in the to-do lists for my [Site](/site).
Finally had the resources to move away from GitHub Pages into my own VPS.
Also edited a few lines.
- Edited a few terms in [Old Computer Challenge](/old-computer).

Another brand new (Fri)day?
What now?

We're feeling extra generous today,
so we walked our dog twice.
Morning walk was to the bank (ATM only).
Traffic hadn't build up yet then.
Evening walk was just a shortened version of our usual route.
Already late to get a good look at sunset.
The evening summons the joggers and dog-walkers.
We participate.

We need to put some time, though, to train the dog.
It can be hard to remain upright when a ~20-kg canine yanks you because of something excited him.

*This is Day 7 of [Old Computer Challenge](/old-computer).*
