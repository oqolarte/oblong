Network security is important because intrusions compromise your system.
Attackers could have different motivations for attacking your
[network](/network). Security analysts must be constantly alert to
potential vulnerabilities in their organization’s network and take quick
action to mitigate them.

## Network interception attacks

Network interception attacks work by intercepting network traffic and
stealing valuable information or interfering with the transmission in
some way, like [IP spoofing](/ip-spoofing).

Malicious actors can use hardware or software tools to capture and
inspect data in transit.
This is referred to as [packet sniffing](/network-protocol-analyzer). In
addition to seeing information that they are not entitled to, malicious
actors can also intercept network traffic and alter it by inserting
malicious code modifications or altering the message and interrupting
network operations. For example, an attacker can intercept a bank
transfer and change the account receiving the funds to one that the
attacker controls.

## Backdoor attacks

An organization may have a lot of [security](/security)
measures in place, including cameras, biometric scans and access codes
to keep employees from entering and exiting without being seen. However,
an employee might work around the security measures by finding a
backdoor to the building that is not as heavily monitored, allowing them
to sneak out for the afternoon without being seen.

In [cybersecurity](/cybersecurity), backdoors are weaknesses
intentionally left by programmers or system and network administrators
that bypass normal access control mechanisms. Backdoors are intended to
help programmers conduct troubleshooting or administrative tasks.
However, backdoors can also be installed by attackers after they’ve
compromised an organization to ensure they have persistent access.

Once the hacker has entered an insecure network through a backdoor, they
can cause extensive damage: installing malware, performing a
[denial of service](/dos-attack) (DoS) attack,
stealing private information or
changing other security settings that leaves the system vulnerable to
other attacks. A DoS attack is an attack that targets a network or
server and floods it with network traffic.

## Network hardening

Some tasks that are regularly performed are firewall rules maintenance,
network log analysis, patch updates, and server backups.

**Network log analysis** is the process of examining network logs to
identify events of interest. Security teams use a log analyzer tool or a
security information and event management tool, also known as a
[SIEM](/SIEM), to conduct network log analysis. It gathers security data
from a network and presents that data on a single dashboard. The
dashboard interface is sometimes called a single pane of glass.

**Port filtering** is a firewall function that blocks or
allows certain port numbers to limit unwanted
[communication](/communication). A basic principle is that the only
ports that are needed are the ones that are allowed. Any port that isn't
being used by the normal network operations should be disallowed. This
protects against port vulnerabilities.

Networks should be set up with the most up-to-date wireless protocols
available and older wireless protocols should be disabled.

Security analysts also use network segmentation to create isolated
subnets for different departments in an organization. Network
segmentation may also be used to separate different security zones. Any
restricted zone on a network containing highly classified or
confidential data should be separate from the rest of the network.

Lastly, all network communication should be encrypted using the latest
encryption standards. [Encryption](/cryptography) standards are rules or
methods used to conceal outgoing data and uncover or decrypt incoming
data. Data in restricted zones should have much higher encryption
standards, which makes them more difficult to access.

## Applications

Each device, tool, or security strategy put in place by security
analysts further protects---or hardens---the network until the network
owner is satisfied with the level of security. This approach of adding
layers of security to a network is referred to as defense in depth.
