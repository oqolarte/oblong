Religion, itself, is not bad. Maybe.

{{< toc >}}

## Intro

A more nuanced take would be, many religions have imparted nuggets of
wisdom that are still relevant today; their texts are filled with
verbose literature, of poems and proses. It has its own benefits when it
comes to influencing behavior. At least in Christianity, the only one
I'm familiar with, it tames the "iatrogenics of abundance" as observed
by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his book [*Antifragile*](/antifragile).
Meaning, at the core of Christianity, [simple living](/simple-living) leads to a [healthier](/healthy)
and more fulfilling life---very different from the many offshoots that
has sprouted over the thousands of years of its existence.

## Leaders and Organizations

People use religion to maintain their self-image, or at least the idea
of themselves as "good." Often, they too use it to believe that their
actions are "good" even though they are objectively causing harm.
Religious leaders and organizations who use religion as a cudgel and/or
carrot, weaponizing it against the vulnerable and using it to further
their own personal agendas Used this way, religion becomes a barrier to
[accountability](/transformative-justice).

To remain pious, "priests" (or [rigid activists](/joyful-militancy/#rigid-radicalism))
must introduce new moral high grounds to which they will set the current
standards.

## Religion or cult?

"All religions are barriers to progress," Walden Bello observes,
especially if they devolve into cults that negatively affect people's
social standings.

Our society primes us for cult abuse through everyday institutions. Any
institution that relies on us submitting to authority, dismissing our
feelings and observations, isolating us, does this. It's no
wonder there are cults across the political spectrum.

Let's take the Holy Bible, for example. It represents the limited
knowledge of people of its time, trying to put mystical and/or spiritual
experiences into words.
This lack of clarity [leaves room for *a lot* of interpretation](/surrealism) for future generations of believers, even allowing some
of them to take advantage of other people's yearnings to put themselves
into positions of power.

## Good religion?

If your faith is compatible with the end goals of [revolution](/revolution),
that is, as long as you believe that dismantling hierarchies and
vertical structures, and working
towards ending inequality is in line with your teachings,
then there's no reason not to welcome this belief.
If you are standing up to the barriers even within your faith, then even
better.

The people saying that *all* religion is just toxic dogma need to check
themselves.

## Protestant Ethic

Protestant Ethic states that life is good only if one works hard, is
frugal, and has self-restraint. Poverty, the Ethic goes, is escapable;
it all depends on the individual's discipline and austerity. All this
does not factor in the external factors beyond one's control, like bad
luck, bad employers exploiting their labor, or bad economy, the pull of
all of which is *very* hard to escape.
