I like how [Nina Rajcic](https://ninarajcic.com/) shares her [thoughts about sexual desire](https://realhumanbaby.tumblr.com/post/738819738307837952):

> Sexual desire is the craziest feeling [because] this kind of fire
> illuminates your surroundings and colours everything orange, until you
> are so beautifully oriented.

How accurate to use something as elemental and as primitive as fire to
explain the range of emotions that stem from our primitive roots. She
warns, though, that:

> [...] a fire not properly regulated has the potential to destroy
> everything too. [...] To keep a steady flame, you must direct the fire
> towards something other than its own expansion.
