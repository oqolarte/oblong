I ramble not on [animal liberation](/animal-liberation), although I wish I had the decency to
do so. Instead, I share the latest happenings in our neighborhood.

## City pound visits

MONDAY---We take it seriously when the neighborhood dogs
bark in chorus. Something bad is happening. We check it.

City pound pays a visit, and almost right away at least one dog is
shrieking. Pierces the quiet street. Dogs in other houses howl in
unison, worried of the imminent danger.

We learn the dog's humans themselves have summoned the city pound and
given their own pet away to *die*. Along with the dog, they also give
away their cat who "doesn't tire of giving birth."

This is heartbreaking.

City pounds are known to be brutal and inhumane towards the animals
impounded there. Many of them are malnourished, exposed to weather
elements, and suffering from dehydration.

To decongest the animal population, a city pound can legally euthanize
their incarcerated animals, the most "humane" way of which is through
barbiturates. And as I know it, they regularly decongest.

Life goes on for the family that surrenders their pet to the city pound.

The city pound goes on to visit other areas to impound other families'
animals.

## "Dark green car"

TUESDAY, the following day---I have just washed my face when I hear a
commotion outside. These words stand out, in Filipino: "cat" and "got
hit". As someone who lives with a cat, panic kicks me into dashing out
the street to meet my neighbors. That's when I see him, lying on his
side, still handsome in my opinion despite being a victim of hit-and-run.

He was not one of our cats, but Thor---I ask for his name from the
humans who have cared for him---had visited us. Thor would cause
harmless mischief during his trips to our garden or rooftop. Looking
back, he should be named Loki, but his meows could indeed be thunderous,
especially recently that he seemed in heat. We had called him Mocha
after the blend of colors of this Siamese cat.

Mocha-Thor's humans agree that we lay him in our garden next to our
banana sprout where he will be shaded. Giving him dignity is the least
we can do.

This is an opportunity to be [in solidarity with our local community](/community), to offer what we can even if it is just ample
space to grieve and be angry. Mocha-Tor does not deserve a violent way
to go; this community does not deserve injustice like this.

This to my kin I do convey. "Linger not on anger," they say.

Lies go on, I thought, as I adapt them to still my nerves. Malice cannot
be everyone's default. Idiocy on the other hand can and does take
lives.

## Epilogue

Suffering does not end. We can only do what we can.
