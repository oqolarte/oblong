## Concept of asal

Jocano explains that we can't give [halaga](/halaga) to something unless
we see something good in it, which is dictated by *asal*, which can
happen at the subconscious level.

*Asal* is the [set of values and norms](/filipino-values) which consist of
tastes and preferences concerning what is desirable, true, good, and
beautiful. Through asal, Filipinos judge, accept, or reject, other
members of the community. When observed, harmonious relations emerg
between individuals or groups. Otherwise, they face conflicts.

Good character, when defined *via negativa*, means:
- not harming others;
- not straining relationships;
- not hurting feelings; and
- not staining honor of others

The concept of asal gives ethical and moral substance to the actions we
do and feelings we feel. So, the mind must be clear, the heart must
care, and the hands must be skilled. These forces, when they work
together, result in excellent ways of being and doing.

### Elements of asal

Asal has three major components:
- [*kapwa*](/kapwa) (relational standard)
- [*damdamin*](/damdamin) (emotional standard), and
- [*dangal*](/dangal) (moral standard)
