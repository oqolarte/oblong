Access to internet is important in this age of information,
but do we have the necessary infra for it to be accessible to everyone,
no matter the social status?

Consider this: students without internet access are at
[risk of educational lag](/pedagogy), especially when [educational institutions](/academy) embed more of
learning resources online, usually behind paywall.
It doesn't help that our physical public libraries are not well-funded
to keep up with the learning demand.

Internet access should be universal, equitable, and non-discriminatory,
not a commodity to be bought and sold for profit.

## Cloud

The "Cloud" is just the internet served using other people's---really,
companies', like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta---computers and
proprietary infrastructure.
