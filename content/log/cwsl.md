Hello!
Here are the recent changes:
- Definitely removed all emojis from all pages in this site.
- Added minor notes for [Homebrew Server](/server).
- Added four new entries and four new one-liners in [Imbentori](/imbentori).

Speaking and writing in English will always be a life-long learning experience,
especially for non-native speakers like me.
Some would agree that mastering a second language would eventually involve
playing with words and intending puns.

Consider the following stream of consciousness from my drafts folder:

> Multi-colored roofs in a neighborhood of dreams
> of varying contours and angles,
> and how they deflect light,
> would definitely have an impact on my body if I would approach
> one of them from above, as commanded by gravity.

I wrote this some two years ago.
It beats around the bush, sure,
because I was like that back
then---a person full of uncertainties.
Going through the motions felt like free-falling
to my Being's demise (not necessarily a physical death),
but more boring.

I have another one, from *the same* draft:

> One can't pinpoint for sure the exact source of all the twisting,
> but if I had to think aloud,
> it might have come from the accumulation of dirt and crime,
> small though they may be.

I wasn't exactly attempting to hide by a burning bush then,
but these timestamped notes encrypted my emotions and,
at the same time, purged me of my little demons.

That's one minute,
I'll see you next time!
