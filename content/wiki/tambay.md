## What is?

*Tambay* is a Tagalog word derived from the English word *standby*. It's
closer to "hang out" than just standing by, although both acts do not
require any purpose other than the act itself, usually with people one
likes, including [friends](/friends).

## Purpose?

Why *tambay*? Because!

Because you want to do nothing other than simply be. It is like
meditation if you want it to be or when you are alone, sans the need to
close your eyes and take deep breaths. But you can also "do" this with
people you like who also have the time to waste with you. *HOHOL*
(hang-out hang-out *lang*), as per the modern parlance.

Because there is literally nothing to be done, except be. Life is
brutal; and the adversaries that do not want us to flourish on our own
terms, even more so. If the empire's response to our working hard is
poverty, then we hit back with [anti-work](/anti-work): *Tambay* is one
of the last acts (or non-acts, if you prefer) we can own and say, "*Oo,
tatambay ako!*"[^tambay1]

[^tambay1]: In this context, it roughly means "Yes, I *choose* to do
nothing but hang out!"

Because waiting in itself can be tedious and uneventful. Waiting for
*something* can be mentally taxing. *Tambay* is cooler---one has
accepted that there is no other purpose than to be Here Now.

Because we genuinely want to hang out with friends, family, peers,
colleagues, and other people in our life. Other modes of tambay might
include, but not limited to: inuman, tsismisan, etc.

  by Sonja Dahl, in which the author writes about *nongkrong*, "an
  Indonesian term meaning, essentially, 'hanging out,'" but likely
  closer to "squatting by the side of the road with a cigarette" or
  "sitting around because you're not doing any work" in literal meaning.
