This is the tendency that emphasizes abolishing human exploitation of nature,
leading to some variants like,
[social ecology](/social-ecology),
[post-civ](/post-civ),
[anti-civ](/anti-civ),
and [primitivist](/primitivism) conceptions.

If we humans accept that we need to work together in keeping the planet
habitable for us all, we might just have a chance at preserving our species
longer.

Of course, the planet will heal in time. But its current destruction
will leave millions, if not billions, dying who *most likely* did not
[consent](/consent) to it. We cannot have nice things because generally
we are not nice to other people. Not everyone has to be friends---it's
impossible---but can we at least default to being kind?

At this point, more than ideals, we should start standing up and try to
fix things.

The fossil fuel, the meat, and the stuff industries are all bad.
Individual choices do have an impact,
but they are also constrained by the systems we're in.

When the machinations of capitalism produce what is essentially trash,
we scramble to innovate---or really force ourselves---to repurpose it,
to appropriate it so it would fit in our communities. We've seen
single-use plastics remade to bags or pots.
But it's hard to sustain this cadence when trash comes in deluge, and we
only have several pairs of helping hands.

We can't keep repurposing capitalist garbage. And this is not limited to
just stuff: [economics](/economics) is something borne out of the
current Empire without any real practical use. It's analysis is based on
extractive nature of Empire. At some point, we would have to expropriate
the source which belongs to all of us.

That said, each of us have a personal responsibility. Individuals can
[stand together](/mutual-aid)---going from "me" to "we"---and [demand
big structural changes](/revolution). That could mean demanding
renewable energy, better public transportation infrastructure,
divestment from pollutative industries, investment in plant-based
agriculture, a focus on rewilding, and better regulations on industry.

I---you, we---can do this, should do this by
[living the best way we can](/simple-living),
encourage others to do the same,
and get involved in some sort of [activism](/activism).
