I am not a Kanye West fan, especially now that he has gone... far from
his former self---sure, people change, but wouldn't it be nice if it
were for the better?---but this album is a good trip down the memory
lane. I appreciate how many of the tracks are both funny *and*
serious. Now I get why he referred to himself as
[the espresso shot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eSFDuX2bMQ).
