## Social hierarchy as domination...?

I was born into a hierarchical society the [politics](/politics) of
which I didn't choose to be in, and yet here we are, dealing mostly with
the negative effects of not being at the top. Even [democracy](/democracy), the
hierarchy of majority, slowly chips away at the foundations of modern
society, though many of us believe it to be sound in theory.

## Leaning about hierarchy from baboons

In the video "[*Why hierarchy creates a destructive force within the human psyche*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4UMyTnlaMY)" (YouTube),
neuroscientist Robert Sapolsky shows how stress and hierarchy are linked
through his study of baboons. So (simplifying a lot here), a dominant
male would have significantly lower stress hormones than a submissive
one, and the "have-nots" have increased heart rates and higher blood
pressure. When an unfortunate event wiped out the alpha males (the mean
bullies and jerks who would lash out at anyone below their status) of
the troop Sapolsky was studying, it altered the way of living of those
left behind. The troop has become gentler, more kinder to one another,
even influencing the newcomers to adopt this behavior.

It's evidence that a hierarchical system which benefits only few
privileged individuals [can be changed](/revolution) to one that is harmonious,
cooperative, social, and accepting of all types.

Sapolsky's research, and the troops of baboons participating in it, show
that it's not inevitable, that even people in power can change if
they're brought up in a [culture](/culture) that teaches them to value harmony.
Of course, it does not happen overnight, or [violence](/violence) would
surely erupt.
