In a society of jealousy and ownership,
non-monogamy challenges assumptions
on intimate relationships---romantic, sexual,
and everything in between and beyond.

Do we love more than our friends/loved ones?
And do we take care of more than the people we love?
If the answer is "no one" then it might well be [revolutionary love](/revolution).

State and its bureaucracy, and Capitalism
discourage meaningful interaction.
Are you friends with the cashier at your grocery store?
In [r/antiwork](https://old.reddit.com/r/antiwork) subreddit,
a lot of people there will remind you to consider carefully
if you're planning to befriend your coworkers.
Impersonal relationships abound,
which leads us to easily hate on each other.

But is it possible show the people unconditional love?
