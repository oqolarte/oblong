Copied from the [series found in r/Ph](https://old.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/1aeige6/worst_thing_each_philippine_president_has_ever/) of the same title.

Items under each president are based on the top answers of people who
participated in the discussion, which may or may not be fact-checked.
Filipino redditors also skew to those living in the National Capital
Region, so their lived experiences vary from people in other, less
populous regions.
