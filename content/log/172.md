The first time I was fully present in changing of guards was
[when we were in Taiwan](https://seekers.araw.xyz/taiwan-part1/). The choreography was both intense and fluid. To a lesser
extent, the recent changes in household members feels similar.

For some nights now, I have been having a whirlwind of dreams related to
educational institutions, and how in many of them, I had either failed
or barely escaped my failure. Because of these, my sleep has been
slightly off. If I were to interpret: I feel I don't seek social
validation like I used to, and my brain is telling me, "Please do!
You're a social creature. And do it in the form of getting into grad
school."
