## Brief Review of *Some People Need Killing*

I have waived my distaste for hard-bound books to finish this
book.[^hard-bound] Like
the stories here, I say that without exaggeration.

[^hard-bound]: It could be said that hard-bound books last longer. But
do they really? I'm starting to think that it's just a marketing strat for
publishers to overprice such books. Also, I don't get book
(dust) [jackets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_jacket): they flippin' flap around, so much that it annoys me. It's
already 2023: don't we already have the technology to integrate the book design
on the hard cover itself?

Seriously, though, I'm a fan of the Patricia Evangelista's concise
prose: true to journalism, it doesn't get in the way of telling the
stories of victims of Duterte's war on drugs.

It presents different perspectives, including some of the author's (who
covered the drug war for six years for a local publication), that
converge into a seemingly obvious conclusion: that the war on drugs, at
its core, is a tool used conveniently by a select few to further their
agenda, at the expense of thousands of lives. In reality, though, the
conclusion may not be so obvious to a lot of us. Many would still
idolize a strongman, disregarding fully his fascistic tendencies, hoping
he can bring about the needed change.

Personally, I found the book heavy. It took me a while to finish it
because I could only at most read one chapter at a time without being
engulfed in burning rage.

## What does it feel like to be consumed by hate?

In the supposed spacetime that is the Christmas season in the Philippine
archipelago, feelings adjacent to love abound. Some heal, some destroy.
It would've been great (read: grim) if there's an ultimatum that forces
everyone to feel the same festive feeling---to create happiness or some
other jovial miracle out of thin air---but we're humans, much more
capable than that simple force.

One of them, on its wheel of color, is hate. And I posit a deep
thought related to the question, but it disappears. In its place are
more questions in need of deeper answers.

Should I ask the territorial mammals in the neighborhood, all of them
trapped together in the urban hellscape of Metro Manila?

Should I ask the vengeful spirits that always scheme for a violent
ending to their enemies' sleep?

When one rewards hate with more of it, it grows like sarcoma when fed
with sugar, so the pop science says.

## FLU

This household has been nursing various types of weather-related
illnesses this past few days.

We are getting better, and hopefully, nothing disastrous damages our
already limited brain cells.

## Christmas Dinners with friends

We hosted two different dinners with two different sets of friends this week.
Each was a different kind of chill, each filled with storytelling and
laughter, an invigorating experience that counters the effects of the holidaze.

For self-proclaimed purveyors of the non-traditional,
it's oddly good that we embraced the tradition of
Christmas with non-traditional Christmas food, including pizzas, donuts,
lasagna, fruit platters, Mexican-inspired beans, seafood *swam*, and
coffee. Nowhere were spaghetti, pancit, hotdogs, fruit salads, hams,
roasted chickens, and other usual attacks to *coraz√≥n*. We are [anti-cool](/146/#on-being-cool)
like that.
