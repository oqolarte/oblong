The [empire](/empire) treats animals horribly,
and is both effective and efficient in doing so.

Animal liberation goes beyond not consuming animal products, and even
beyond [veganism](/veganism). As I see it, it is about treating every
living creature your equal, the [hierarchy](/hierarchy) between human and nonhuman
completely abolished. Which is a difficult reminder especially to
myself who is not even a vegan yet. Like
[many political movements](/politics),
I aim to base my choices on understanding what
animal oppression is, and how can I reconcile, if at all possible, those
choices as a non-vegan.

## Animal shelters

Animal shelters exist in start contrast to the
[capitalist mindset](/capitalism).

Most, if not all, shelters don't generate profit. How can they, when
only few are sympathetic to the plight of non-humans? What little
resources they have come from the volunteers' efforts.

By their very nature, they are [mutual aid](/mutual-aid).
Rescuers strive to lessen the rescued animals' suffering.
Some people would adopt some of the animals and give them new homes
for another chance at a better life.

Animal shelters continue to build and rebuild new relationships with
non-human animals outside of hierarchies and oppression.
Even when feral dogs bite back during a rescue attempt,
the volunteers understand that responding with [violence](/violence) would not help.

Animal shelters take up real estate.
Agents of Profit frown on this;
to them, a non-income-generating lot is a waste of space.
The State doesn't like this either;
if the shelters can't pay tax,
they'll cut the utilities.
A non-residential establishment should give back to the community,
the State and the Capitalists would say.
Which is an odd thing to say, knowing these shelters do give back in the
form of their very work!

If you're a member of animal shelter group, thank you for your work!
Please continue rescuing and saving animals.
You're existence shifts the balance of the status quo,
and that's what we all---humans and non-humans alike---need right now.
