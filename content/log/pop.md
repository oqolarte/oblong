Pop music is as perennial as grass.[^grass]
And like grass, it's there for a reason.
Whether we know this reason doesn't matter in the grand scheme of
things.[^scheme]
No matter what your music preference is,
pop music will always find its way on your radar.
Tempting you with its catchy tunes and overuse of millenial whoops and hey's.
Might as well find it in you the willingness to experience them,
not just to tolerate their existence,
but to enjoy them, if only for a little while.

[^grass]: Writing prompt: use "as perennial as grass" in your next writing, like
  every other legit writer out there.
[^scheme]: Another prompt: use "grand scheme of things."
