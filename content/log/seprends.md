My main laptop ("Ador") broke on me about a month ago now.
Twice I ordered a replacement motherboard in Lazada, and twice the seller cancelled on me.
They gave me no reasons.

I'm typing this on the [old computer](/old-computer) that I used last July.
But this won't get published until I figure out how to SSH into my server without my keys.
A hard lesson, I guess, for me, and a reminder for you, to always have a back-up for everything.
What you can, keep a copy of it somewhere, kids!

On the good side, I got to focus more on my newfound job.
I career-shifted into it, so learning the new ways of working can be tricky, and requires my full attention.
The thing is, even stripped down and minimal, I still find excuses to make Ador distract me. 
Mainly, it's because of my RSS feed. 
I like reading blogs and op-eds and people's technical perspectives on things that I find interesting.
I call it Research when it adds value to me;
mindless consumption when it doesn't.
Would you guess how many hours I had spent thoughtlessly perusing articles?

On the bad side, I've been using *only* Windows, and all of its heavily restricting apps.
Office 365 almost requires the user to be perpetually be online.
I'm losing my Vim- and Unix-game here, people, help me.
