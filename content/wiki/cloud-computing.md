The "Cloud" is just the internet served using other people's---really,
companies', like Google, Amazon, Microsoft,
and Meta---[computers](/computer) and
proprietary infrastructure.
And like many network infrastructure,
[the cloud also needs to be secured](/cloud-security).

## Intro

Cloud computing is the practice of using remote servers, applications,
and [network](/network) services that are hosted on the
[internet](/internet) instead of on local physical devices.

A cloud service provider (CSP) is a company that offers cloud computing
services. These companies own large data centers in locations around the
globe that house millions of servers. Data centers provide technology
services, such as storage, and compute at such a large scale that they
can sell their services to other companies for a fee. Companies can pay
for the storage and services they need and consume them through the
CSP’s application programming interface (API) or web console.

## CSP services

**Software as a service (SaaS)** refers to software suites operated by
the CSP that a company can use remotely without hosting the software.
The software is mostly front-end applications that users access via a
web browser.

**Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)** refers to the use of virtual
computer components offered by the CSP. These include virtual containers
and storage that are configured remotely through the CSP’s API or web
console. Cloud-compute and storage services can be used to operate
existing applications and other technology workloads without significant
modifications. Existing applications can be modified to take advantage
of the availability, performance, and security features that are unique
to cloud provider services.

**Platform as a service (PaaS)** refers to tools that application
developers can use to design custom applications for their company.
These are back-end application development tools that developers use to
write code and build, manage, and deploy their own apps. Custom
applications are designed and accessed in the cloud and used for a
company’s specific business needs. Some examples of PaaS services
include Google App Engine™ platform, Heroku®, and VMware Cloud Foundry.

## Benefits of cloud computing to businesses

1. Reliability: allows employees and customers to access the resources
   they need consistently and with minimal interruption.
2. Cost: because CSPs have large data centers, they are able to offer
   virtual devices and services at a fraction of the cost required for
   companies to install, patch, upgrade, and manage the components and
   software themselves.
3. Scalability: allows flexibility of businesses to consume and avail
   services offered by CSPs in an elastic utility model as needed. This
   means that availing cloud computing services reduces the risk of
   unnecessary cost buy only paying for what they need when they need
   it.
