What a week it's been.
It started and ended,
as do matches when struck and lit.

## Ignorance is Bliss?

No one is safe from one's own potential for inconsistencies.
As humans with different levels of complexities,
it's no shock that we make wrong moves.
At some point, we have been hypocrites,
whether we recognized it later or not.
I'd rather have the self-awareness to detect my falling to fallacies,
than not know and harm myself and those around me.

## Patience

Another complicated thing I'm still working on: patience.
But as the new trend goes, "Questions are the new answers."
Here are some:

- How do I pause to reflect during the peak of my intense negative emotions?
- Will I always have enough time to think first before impatience becomes
  impermanence?
- What can I do to keep my community patient?
Should I even meddle with other people's affairs?

## Community Intervention?

The last point in the previous section
is based on a recent incident in our neighborhood.

One of the houses from down the street erupted;
two men were shouting at each other,
reaching a crescendo as they stepped out of their house.
We couldn't make out what the contention was,
but we heard the expletives these two adults yelled.

As they verbally abused one another,
their screams continued to tear through the nearby houses.
Not only did they hurt each other,
they also hurt us, those who were within hearing distance.

From what we can surmise,
the two men might have some unresolved issues with one another.
I could only imagine the pain they have to endure in living with one another.

In this situation, what would you have done?

It would have been better if someone trained in dealing
with these kinds of situations was able to intervene and deescalate.
