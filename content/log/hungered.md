Hunger, the physical, guttural one,
is a penitence most of us won't choose,
unless it's for something important, like health or spirituality.

Personally, I'll always look for food when I'm hungry,
a natural reaction polished by evolution.

But neither evolution not common social conventions could have prepared me for a
cat sitting on my lap,
un-budging.

How am I supposed to get food then?
