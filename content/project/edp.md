***Each day poking*** is a writing exercise borne out of the need to be
creative again as I transition to [brief?] unemployment, spanning the
month of October 2024.

The goal is to write *daily* streams of consciousness, parallel to
[*Imbentori*](/imbentori) but for the older-me.

Each entry could also be a script for a hypothetical YouTube channel or
a podcast, or both.

When life gets in the way, some
entries might be so short, or I might not be able to write anything.
Whether I am pressuring myself to produce an outlet will have to be
observed on the day itself.

## Day 1

Someone is smoking. It is so familiar yet so offensive. I have grown to
hate the smell of anything burning, especially that of a not-so-subtle,
legal addiction. It is a bit odd, though, knowing that I was once a
smoker myself.

Stranger still, I am currently within the proximity of or facilitating
different nicotine-related surveys. [Capitalism](/capitalism) incentivizes hypocrisy by
allowing it to be one of the major ways to live and afford a decent food
and housing. Thankfully, I will not be doing them soon. Time to drop off
these things underneath which I barely comprehend. All of it, and
finally regain what was gradually being lost to cognitive dissonance for
the past three years.

I do not miss the risk of cells calcifying into cancer in my body. I
left that miserable hobby, and I will not be subjecting my being through
that again. But I do not blame people for seeking the hook. I, too, was
once on their side, shedding minutes by transmuting tobacco into
snake-trails to heaven.

Big tobacco company smuggles tons of sticks into the hands of the
underprivleged, and they get away with it, like they often do, because
of some outreach program "for the environment" or some doublespeak noun
they come up with.

No one should have the gall to openly light a cig in the presence of
non-smokers. (Yes, I mean that in the literal and figurative sense.)
Inconsiderate moves like that snags the throats of unsuspecting people
akin to lying to them akin to green-lighting the kill order that can
only be legally executed through capitalist machinery.

## Day 2

Already, I can hear the gears turning and the knobs within emit a foul
smell, those bits and pieces attached to the complaints center. I read
the print out: "WHY DOES ONE FORCE ONESELF TO CREATE?"

I don't know, but certainly not because there isn't enough drama in my
life.

But what does that have to do with this effort? I don't know.

I can feel the stomach grumbling; I shall not remove it from its pit. I
wonder, though what its print out says. "EVENING---

METABOLISM DROPS, AND YET THERE IS NEED FOR FOOD."

Of course. Time to check in with the body. Putting this off for
tomorrow. A better one. Lovelier and obviously with more effort,
something I to be sold to a therapist.
