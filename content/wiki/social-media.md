## In the beginning

Age reveal without age reveal---I remember when social networking sites
like Friendster and Yahoo Messenger were fun ways of keeping in touch
with classmates and friends after school hours.

Even when we all started migrating to Facebook, it was just this thing that
we did for a few hours, before eventually logging out to do other
things in the real world.

Now, it's safe to say that a lot has changed. The biggest social media
platforms are designed to retain users for as long as possible, because
our attention means interaction, and interaction means more data for
them to analyze. More data means personalized ads for you and me.

## Monetizing our data

Who does not like seeing the things what our friends and family are up
to these days?
Do we not light up when they talk about something we love [to hate]?
Social connection is important to us, and social media platforms have
become the digital bridges that collapses distance and time between two
people.

At the cost of their data.

Our attention spans have been commodified. Unless you're using an
ad blocker, the internet will bombard you with targeted ads no thanks to
the data brokers who have bought a dossier of you, likely from the likes
of Google, Facebook, and other big tech companies.

To keep us engaged, an algorithm is baked into the design of a social
media platform. No one really fully understands how an algorithm works,
except that it keeps a tally of what types of "content" a user usually
interacts with, and from this input feeds it into a black box that
outputs a feed that the user will likely engage with more. Like I said,
the key is to retain users, and the algorithm is the main tool for that.

People who use social media as work---the so-called influencers and
content creators---are stuck in appeasing the algorithm, creating more
"content" in unhealthy rates to stay relevant.

### Surveillance

So, is monetization, then, the problem?

Not necessarily, I think.

I think the more important question is: Who owns the means of
production? Who owns these social media platforms, and what are they
doing with all the data they are gathering from their userbase?
