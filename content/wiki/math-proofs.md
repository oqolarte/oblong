Mathematical proofs start with axioms and self-evident statements as the
building blocks. Then, logic is presented, step by step, until it
reaches the conclusion, at which point it is called theorem.
Mathematical theorems follow this rigorous process, and when proven, are
true forever.

Theorems need to be checked with rigor because they are the foundations
of [mathematics](/math). This is because once a theorem is proved, it
can then be used as a tool in another larger proof, which in turn can
also be used in another much larger proof, and so on. If a theorem is
left unchecked and it reveals a mistake down the line, all other
theorems that used it can no longer be fully trusted.

## Scientific theories

Scientific theories start with a hypotehsis which makes an informed
prediction based on available data. To test the predictive power of a
hypotehsis, scientists conduct experiments that prove (or disprove) the
hypotehsis. A successful outcome becomes evidence for the hypotehsis.
Scientific theories, are just a bunch of pieces of evidence for a
hypothesis, but the idea is that it cannot be proven with absolute
certainty. Mathematical proofs, on the other hand, are "absolutely true"
once proven.

## [Incomplete] list of types of proof

***Reductio ad absurdum*** (proof by contradiction) is the logical
conclusion in a math concept/theorem in which it is false.
