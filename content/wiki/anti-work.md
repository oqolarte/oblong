## What is work and anti-work?

Let's define *Work* as all activity that makes profit, whether for
oneself or someone else. So this includes not only wage labor, but also
slave labor, prison labor, unpaid housework, internships, and many more
forms of self-employment, which we find doing as required by our needs
(to get by, to not be unalive, to have a decent living, etc.).

Anti-work, in this context, then means a practice that
obsoletes the need to work
(i.e., that which results to someone's profit),
like how anti-matter destroys matter.
Because we are not meant to live like this:
Grinding away our lives for the Hustle.
You may have it worse if you're a gig worker: companies have exploited
anyone who have worked in the gig industry by ignoring labor laws and
sometimes paying less than minimum wage.

{{< figure src="/image/not-lazy.jpg" alt="Felix the Cat, a black cartoon cat is lying on a window ledge, smiling contentedly. He's thinking 'I'm not lazy; I just don't like making profits for capitalists..." caption="" >}}

We are meant to live in [loving communities](/friendship)
in which we can [help each other meet our daily needs](/mutual-aid).

Power Gets Things Done, but at the hands of Authority it also oppresses people.
The state does this in the public sphere, and your average CEO does it in the
workplace.

In an ideal world, we would be okay with lower-case-w "work" as
*any activity or purposeful intent towards some goal*.

## HR is not your friend

Human resource management has roots in the exploitative nature of
slavery, whose big concepts like [mass surveillance](/surveillance) and
modern policing
continue to shape our workspaces.

Indeed, many progressive thinkers agree that we have not fully abolished
slavery, only modernized it and given it a kinder face.

But if you are a blue-collar worker who cannot take breaks lest it is
deducted from your salary or a knowledge worker pressured into working
(sometimes payless) overtime to "finish a report," HR will see to it
that the employer gets the maximum profit out of your labor.

## No one is lazy and unskilled

But you may have learned helplessness, which is more common.

Work employs ennui. Think about whether your profession, no matter how
noble you think it is, is an actual path to self-realization or
hindrance to it.

And, [modern] slavery is not a reliable source of quality labor.
Imagine what would happen when the workers have decided to organize a sustained
[sabotage](/sabotage).

You, the worker, have experienced failures or been convinced you are a failure. This
causes the depressive symptoms that look like laziness, and the feeling
that you can't accomplish anything. This becomes a negative feedback
loop: since you barely try, fearing failure, you are more likely to fail
again. On the flip side, when you have successes, you are more likely
to attribute them to luck or some other force, instead of to your self.

This can be fixed. A good way is usually tackling
it head on. This means looking objectively at what you can do, setting
goals that you care about, giving yourself credit for successes, and
viewing failures as information from which to learn and improve
yourself---they may slow you down, but they don't have to stop you.

## But what about comforts?

Comforts, peer recognition, and success achieved by Getting Work Done is
made possible not solely by the worker themself, but also of the myriad
of invisible people and things around and beyond the Work:

- There are other workers that must not be paid fairly so that the
  "savings" will be allotted pay the salaries of middle management and C-suite;
- Trade policies favor richer nations and therefore its workers, extracting more resources from
  the Global South than they give back, if they do at all;
- Financial and social safety nets that come with being born into a
  well-off, well connected family allows the luckier ones to pick and
  choose a career path without having to worry whether it would pay well
  in the future;
- and other things.

The indvidualist worker would be shocked again, as they likely did
during the peak Covid, when another global catastrophe happens that
would require all of us to act more than ourselves, beyond the
so-called borders of classes and nations.

All I'm saying: no one is self-made. So, why bother working hard.
Instead, work kinder and smarter together. It might just unlock new
comforts for all of us.

## Ideally, there's no need for Work

If you ask me what an ideal world would be, its society no longer
believes in the value of money. Such is not our society, though, and
because of that, I am still saving what I can from my monthly salary,
going to work as often as I can, even job-hopping. It's a feedback loop
worth considering, especially if it takes up 40 hours in my week.

But since the market grows ever more competitive, it makes it harder for
us those seeking greener pastures to demand higher salary, when we don't
want to offer our services at cheaper labor cost. Sex work is largely a
taboo where I live, but when you think about it, it's also work, and
don't we, the workers, also sell our bodies, our souls even, in one form?

Is this the ideal world? If so, then I am an outsider looking in. Yet, I
have the mind to think that this isn't the ideal conditions for 99% of
living things in this world. The 1% who controls where the resources
flow are greedy and care only for themselves. They sustain the
competition. The reward for our hard work is more hard work.

There's no excitement in working
or in looking for work---only in permanently leaving them.

[Slowing down the grind](/slow-productivity) might be a decent
compromise for some, but we must not settle on such lukewarm reforms.
And anyway, careerism, says Nassim Nicholas Taleb, is "the debasing of
knowledge by turning it into a competitive sport."

Most people go to work not because they like it
but because they are coerced to it.
If it weren't their lives on the line,
these same people would likely [escape the rat race.](/personal-finance)

Repression is not a job. But others seem to enjoy it when they say that
we should "earn a living," which intself is a form of gaslighting
capitalists have told us many times over until we have internalized it.
Sometimes, though, they innovate and [give us some free money](/UBI).
But it's not enough.

I find it cruel that our only value as living beings is in our ability
to create capital for people who don't.

[Economics](/economics) promotes a set of pseudo-scientific beliefs that
the distribution of money is fair and efficient, when it's most often
the opposite. People in power, usually [capitalists](/capitalism), use
this to justify their privilege, how they exploit the working class, how
they plunder the natural resources for their own benefit, etc.

## Advice to anyone working

If you can't find a job that aligns with your [values](/personal-principles),
do your best with what you have:

- [Read and brush up on topics](/politics) that are important to you.
- Organize your workplace.
- [Help and/or support people around you with whatever you can offer](/mutual-aid).
