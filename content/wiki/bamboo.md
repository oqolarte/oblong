## Being invasive

However, some bamboo can be invasive
for the very fact that it grows fast.
It also chokes the other surrounding plants.

Well-maintained bamboo farms would be great,
but a significant buffer would be needed to keep nearby ecosystems safe.
A wall isn't enough, as bamboo can grow *through* masonry.

## Treatment

To protect from insects
(like termites, borers, powderpost beetle, and even fungi),
treat bamboo before use.

Mature bamboo between 3--5 years old is selected.
Not only because they are stronger and have completed
their lignification process,
they also shrink less.
Since they are less in starch and sugar,
insects are less likely to go to them.

Bamboo poles are soaked in a borax and boric acid solution
for 7 days for full penetration.

Borax (sodium borate) is a natural insect repellent and preservative.
Boric acid (hydrogen borate) is a weakly acidic hydrate of boric oxide
with mild antiseptic, antifungal, and antiviral properties.

After soaking for a week,
bamboo is stacked vertically to allow the solution to drain.

They are then left to dry under the sun for another 7 days,
rotating them daily to avoid cracking.
