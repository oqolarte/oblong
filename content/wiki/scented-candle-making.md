## TOOLS

- cotton wick: pre-waxed, corded/braided for vessel candles
- wick clips
- wax
- fragrance oil or essential oil
- wax melter; or alternatively:
        - old and/or 2nd-hand rice cooker; or
        - double boiler

## WAXES

- soy: soft; clean burn; burns 25 - 50% longer; ideal pouring
  temperature is 32 - 43 degrees Celsius; better scent throw
- beeswax: firmer; clean burn; [may or may not help in purifying air](https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/50048/do-beeswax-candles-purify-the-air);
  ideal pouring temperature is 55 - 65 degrees Celsius; better aesthetic
        - sometimes blended with coconut oil (don't use VCO; only
          refined cooking oil)
- paraffin: hardest; not the cleanest burn because it's a petroleum
  by-product, cheap; ideal for survival

## SCENTS

- fragrance oils: compounds that create fragrance; usually synthetic;
  may or may not contain essential oils; usually cheaper than essential
  oils
- essential oils: oils extracted from vegetation; can withstand higher
  heat; higher margin of error because of higher flash point; lasts
  longer; more expensive than fragrance oils; those with high [limonene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limonene)
  content, usually found in citrus, can be carcinogenic when burnt

Fragrance ratio is 30 mL (max) of oil is to 450 mL of wax, or 6 - 10% of
total wax weight.

Oils are added to melted wax blend at:
- 70 degrees Celsius for beeswax + coco;
- 42 degrees Celsius for soy

### Basic Scent Guidelines

- Top note: lightest; 20%, usually citrus
- Middle note: "hero"; 50%, usually floral
- Base note: 30%; usually wooden notes

## WICKS

- Cotton: 5 mm wick length
- Anything combustible can be used as wick
- For multiple wicks:
        - 1 wick: 50 mm diameter of container or less
        - 2 wicks: 50 - 65 mm diameter
        - 3 wicks: 65 - 90 mm diameter
        - 4 wicks: 90 - 115 mm diameter

## CONTAINERS

Use any of the following:
- tempered glass;
- aluminum (distributes heat well); or
- any container that can handle heat, is seamless, and preferably has a
  wide opening.
