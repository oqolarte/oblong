We can't create the world we want alone. But it's more attainable when
we do it with friends. As social creatures, it's natural to be part of
something greater than ourselves.

Friendship takes time and energy.
Intimate relationships that we build and maintain with friends matters a
lot in determining the [politics](/politics), personal and social, of
[this world we want to prefigure](/revolution); and will take up energy
and space one might otherwise have for a[nother] romantic relationship.
Thus, we should treat our close friends with the same tenderness and
care we would a partner.

We look into, and learn from, our friends
not because they are our exact copies,
but because of our differences with them.

The sense of community built among friendships is needed to keep us
grounded when we finally have the courage to confront the intricate
system of modern slavery and the restrictive worldviews (like the rising
[fascism](/fascism)) that distort our realities, which could definitely
lead to cognitive dissonance.
