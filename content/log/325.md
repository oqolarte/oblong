## More about using Fathom at work

[The diverse people at New Work](/323/#new-work) introduced me to the
existence of [Fathom](https://www.fathom.ai/), a LLM-powered app that
you also let in on meetings to do the note-taking for you while you
focus on being present and dedicate your mental bandwidth to the actual
discussion. That is the idea at least.

No doubt, even as an [AI critic](/ai)---I voted "no" in
[DuckDuckGo's survey](https://voteyesornoai.com/)---working for a
company whose
services mainly involve AI, I can appreciate the upsides of such tool,
more so that it speeds up the grueling process of scrubbing through a
meeting recording, if any, for any important things I might have missed.

At what cost, though?

If Fathom and similar AI tools could transform you to a "centaur"
(jargon from automation theory to mean "human intelligence (head) with a
tireless robot body"), then great! But what if it made you a "reverse
centaur", that is, you the human become the inefficient,
prone-to-exhaustion body that cleans up the mess the robot "head" has
made?

Imagine no more: People at new work kept on bringing up this one time
that someone's Fathom automatically sent out summarized meeting notes
(as part of its default settings, I believe) to recipients *outside* the
organization ("clients") who were not even in the meeting. Lacking the
context, the non-participants created a bit of stir, which the upper
management had to clean up.

The lesson is to always check the options/settings of a piece of
software, and tweak it so that it has the least amount of privilege
where possible.

Within the wretched confines of corporate work, I am not closing my
doors to using Fathom. It has a free tier, which by now, I take it as,
"Your organizations secrets will be sent to our data lake for analysis.
Thank you for enjoying our product." An unfounded sentiment, yes, but
data harvesting is within the scope of what these AI tools can do. So
for now, I will stick to [VimWiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki)
and old fashioned active listening.

## Needed docs

All I can say is, bless the Human Resources for *requiring* me, despite
my protest, to send Transcript of Records and College of Diploma at this
point in my professional career, more than a decade already since I
graduated from engineering school and this latest one being my fifth
employment already.
