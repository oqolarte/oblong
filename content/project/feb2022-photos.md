For the whole month of February 2022,
I have tried taking one photo a day,
process it however I like---likely through dithering and/or compression---and
share it here.

## Final Thoughts

It's not easy to decide one day that you're taking up photography as a hobby
*just because*,
especially when you're not well to do, like me, to start off.
Decent cameras, even secondhand ones, do not come cheap.

With today's technology, though,
it's not far-fetched to get into wanting to take pictures with a bit of style,
now that we have cameras in smartphones,
which in turn are as accessible as ever.
This is more evident in social media platforms dedicated to sharing photos with other people.

What I did, however, was to borrow, if only for a month, somebody's rarely used
digicam,
and tried photography.

I took no formal classes teaching me how to properly do it.
Maybe one or two YouTube videos on the basics;
maybe another one or two articles about it.
Perhaps, you can see the result of this going by gut feel alone in all of the photos here.

Objectively, I think the end results are a bit bland---but
I'm happy to hear your thoughts!
On the other hand, by foregoing the technicalities at this early stage,
I have allowed myself to be in the moment,
not sweating the small things about taking the perfect shot.

Hence, the products, while not pro, serve as a good reminder of what happened in
that moment.
This way, photography, in my opinion, has served its purpose:
to capture a feeling in a visual medium to be our anchor to the past.
