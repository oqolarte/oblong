"**Prosperity always lives in many open-handed souls**" is my go-to
maxim these days.[^1]

If you are reading this, thank you for considering to support what I do
online.

I am always polishing this site's contents, so that they are updated,
and more importantly, as accessible to as many as possible.

I have also put up an [incomplete list of interesting project ideas](/di-why)
that are currently in their incubation stage.

## Brain Support

See any errors? I accept constructive criticisms, because they help me
grow and learn.

If you just want to share ideas, my inbox welcomes those as well.

Feel free to message me, email in footer!

## Financial support
- [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/oqo_frxbj/donate)
- [Paypal](https://paypal.me/oqolarte)
- [BPI QR Code](/image/BPIQR_OQO.png) (Philippines only)

If you prefer other means of supporting me (e.g. bank transfer, GCash,
Maya, etc.), please email me.

## Hardware support

Whenever I can, I make, fix, and/or [repair](/repair) stuff.

The wishlist below hopefully reflects that.
Please email me first if you plan to give me any of these.

- Single-board computer (any model), used and in good working condition[^used]
- E-book reader, used and in good working condition
- Chain mail[^chain]
- Typewriter in working condition, preferably the portable kind
- 3D printer
- Cargo bike

[^1]: *Limós* is the root of this Tagalog word, meaning "alms".
From [Tagalog Lang](https://www.tagaloglang.com/palimos/): In the Philippines, it is common for street children to approach strangers and say, “Palimos po.”
[^used]: I prefer pre-loved, secondhand, or used stuff,
because I want to extend their life span.
Not that I expect nor encourage people to give me newly bought hardware.
[^chain]: Against random stabbing
