It's a nice and cohesive R&B by a Filipino artist named Robledo Timido.
The lineup is reminiscent of The Weeknd, but not overtly sexual. At
least Timido went to creative lengths to turn the fuccboi aura to a
respectable aesthetic by not including obvious traits of toxic
masculinity.

Pick any song
in this album and compare it to this drug-laced poison of a party vibe,
[Tequila Rose by HELLMERRY x AI James](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9lo1QAZO1c) (YouTube), and Timido will come out a saint and #blessed. Both, I think, are aiming for the same atmosphere, but Timido delivers his a bit better.

Why the random comparison? Well, it's because HELLMERRY's track and Timido's album came to my orbit roughly around the same time.

**Rating**: 3 üòè out of 5
