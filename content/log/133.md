## Blood Donation

Somehow, I misunderstood that wisdom-tooth extraction *is* a major
operation that would disqualify me to donate blood.
In my head, it's only minor, and according to guidelines,
one can donate blood one month after any minor operation.

When the doctor told me that they wouldn't let me continue,
I felt the need to answer the void from which I was phoned home.
An exaggeration, but a much needed one at the time.

## Music

With the recent typhoons, the past few weeks were wet all over everywhere.
Shoegazing in cuddle weather deserves its own niche,
but it leaves dirt in bed.
Thus, no one recommends it.
I remember a similar feeling:
smoking cigarettes while rain pours heavily.
We're not in the habit of romanticizing bad habits,[^smoke-free] though,
so instead of that, I got my hit in these albums last July 2023.

[^smoke-free]: Besides, this year, I've been smoke-free for six years!
