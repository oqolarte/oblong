The root of the word apocalypse comes from the Greek word, *apokálypsis*,
which means “uncovering” or "lifting of the veil."

## Time

It can be argued that the "uncovering" of everything we're familiar with
is dependent on, and thus will come in, time.

But if we are to listen (and we should) from aboriginal wisdoms, time is
not a river (linear) but the sea itself (always been here), affecting
many things in past, present, and future (circular).

Nothing stays the same, whether we believe it or not, but the rate of
change we humans can certainly affect. And the change is cyclical. Viewed this way, history, in its place in Time, not only is in the past but also a prophecy.
