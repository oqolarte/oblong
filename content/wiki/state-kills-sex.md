## Why

My significant other (SO) is closely related to a desaparecido (desap), someone
who is forcibly disappeared by the state. And since that fateful day, SO
and their family has been rightfully grieving.

People in what I would say chronic grieving tend to not prioritize
addressing their libidos. And that is understandable. As in the case of
SO, they are looking for their desap, which entails intense emotional
labor.

## Other ideas worth exploring

- Not having enough means to survive puts undue stress to a person's
  psyche. Women have it harder, as they have to also defend themselves
  against sexual violence and abuse on top of addressing their basic
  needs.
- Can [ethical non-monogamy](/non-monogamy) be the answer to this? That
  is, should people start believing that romantic/sexual love cannot be
  shared between one other person only?
