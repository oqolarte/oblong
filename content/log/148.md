Gregorian calendar. This post is about the tail-end of that.

## Dipping toes in crypto

-graphy, that is.

[After mulling about it for a while](/145/#on-thinking-of-pursuing-grad-school),
I decided to take a short program in "Applied Cryptography Specialization".
Whether something good will come out of it lies on my persistence to
keep showing up, even if I don't feel like it.
Realistically speaking, it might not be enough of a jumpstart for a
"better" career path,
but the future is bleak, the courses.

So far, I'm at the discrete maths part, and it is interesting for me,
despite my limited knowledge of it.
I like how maths has broad enough of a scope that it's in the art of
secret communication as well.

I guess I'm re-subscribing to [Bruce Schneier's Blog](https://www.schneier.com) to start gaining more relevant knowledge on this matter. If you, dear reader, would like to suggest some cryptography- and/or cybersecurity-related blogs, please send them my way.

## On Pessimism

Give people a less-than-decent quality of living,
and a lot of them are bound to have a negative outlook on the upcoming
days. Consider also that most people have the tendency to be pessimist,
because honestly, it's easier. At least it was for me.

I try not to go back to that mood, because I'm not a
healthy pessimist. "It takes strength to be gentle and kind,"
according to The Smiths's song,
perhaps implying that a more positive mindset
I rarely take on challenges, but this one---of
courage and goodness---yields to a net
positive outcome for me and for everyone around me.

## Brief Review of *The Man Without Talent*

The manga by Yoshiharu Tsuge navigates a rocky situation of an artist's
recent choices and how he, even as the main provider of
his family, seemingly prefers odd jobs over "real" work.
What even is "real" work if not dedicating hours of one's life to
something bigger, whether they like it or not?

There are a lot of layers to peel off from this seemingly simple story.
One would be forgiven if they should hiss at the protagonist's
(in)actions, especially if his family's welfare is at stake.

My palm constantly cups my face in disappointment in the artist's behavior.
But this is because, I think, the story is criticizing Japan's highly
patriarchal society.

## Music

For the month of Nov 2023, these are the albums I listened to.

| Album Name          | Artist             |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| Is This It          | The Strokes        |
| Body Talk           | Robyn              |
| Chewing Cotton Wool | The Japanese House |

I really like Robyn's *Body Talk* as I feel it being an antithesis to modern
life's boredom and loneliness, even though some of the lyrics can be
about those. The most iconic song, *Dancing On My Own*, is an upbeat
heart-wrenching synth-pop that, according to a friend, is the femme
equivalent of The Killers's *Mr. Brightside*. In terms of overall sound
and effect, it's hard to disagree.

### Spotify Wrapped 2023

While I'm in Spotify's surveillance and it in
my system, I might well share my top artists of the year:

1. Tennis
2. Japanese Breakfast
3. The Smiths
4. SB19
5. Arctic Monkeys

What this list probably tells about me, according to me:
I'm ready to embrace changes, especially if there's a strong evidence
that it would eventually lead to a
feel-good state. But nostalgia anchors me to a comfort zone that feels
several times better than new, exciting shifts.
