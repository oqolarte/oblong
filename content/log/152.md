I recently watched *Past Lives* (2023), written and directed by Celine
Song. It got me thinking:

The concept of *inyeon* (인연), of past lives lived and relived, of
attempting to make sense of the web of what-ifs annotating the
storylines that intersected at least once, of minding the gap between
two childhood sweethearts---is a familiar feeling I once felt when, like
in the movie, a childhood crush immigrated to Canada for better life.

I would have nursed that budding puppy love, but I grew up shy, thanks
to having odd formative years being mentally and emotionally distant
from the ones with whom I was supposed to be close with. In reality,
there's no point in holding on to that nostalgia. It would have died on
its own, not because it was neglected, but because around it, more
beautiful things continue to grow and flourish. The husk of this puppy
love would fertilize the ground of other future romance. And that is
all there was to it.
