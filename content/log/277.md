Because I was lulled and swayed into it, I watched and thoroughly
enjoyed *Sinners* (2025), directed by Ryan Coogler.

In some corners, it is billed as "horror". Personally, I would not label
it as such, the same way *From Dusk Till Dawn* is NOT horror to me.

**Brief review with mild spoiler**: It explores tales of how muzak fights for
freedom against generations of abuse, against colonialism and racism. No
explicit protest songs here to the best of my knowledge---only muzak
that both invites and wards of demons; that fights *for* [love](/love) and
[friendship](/friendship). The devil wants to partake in the magical, vast fields
blooming between said muzak and said love, even desires to harvest for
which he did not toil. Only if we let him (of course it is a *him*)
could he start causing [chaos](/chaos).
