[People have been expressing themselves](/communication) through the clothes they wear
for many, many millenia now.

I hope I'm not too late to this,
so I'm compiling any fit inspos that I find.

## Yemeni Fashion

Women in Hadramaut, Yemen wear an all black abaya
and a conical straw sunhat called *madhalla*
when working in the fields.
What they're wearing is old yet effective solarpunk solution to the hot
weather.

A madhalla is made from plaited strips of date palm leaves,
and the high peak promotes air circulation inside the hat.

The black color of the abaya actually keeps them cooler
by absorbing heat before it reaches the skin.
The thickness of the fabric helps:
the outer layer does get hotter,
but the heat doesn't get transmitted to the skin.

## Barong Tagalog

I have mostly black and dark colors. It would be cool to have white or
light colored Barong in my rotation of drips. Here are some resources:

## Modern inspo/s

[Frugal Aesthetic](https://www.youtube.com/@FrugalAesthetic) is a
YouTube channel made by someone who "made a career out of stretched
comic sans" but also has in my opinion grounded, if not postmodern, take
on fashion. It is mostly male-centric, though, but not I would say
problematic.

## Fashion, function, both?

In order for to sustain it, fashion has to be fit for purpose and needs
to align with my lifestyle. Beyond cultural purpose, people get caught
up in the the aesthetic side advertised in social media that they end up
thinking less about just the functional purpose of clothes. They're
supposed to protect your body while you're out doing the things you need
to do. So, if any piece of clothing would get in my way (like physically
making less comfortable or restricting movement), then there is no point
in acquiring such items.

This return-to-funtional is return-to-basics is a great way to remind
myself that I'm not really impressing anyone.

In some cultures, there are specific clothes for a specific context.

### Loungewear, examples

In Japan, 部屋着 (heyagi)
means room clothes, and it's like the clothes that aren't pajamas but
clothes you don't wear outside because they'll get dirty. They're
meant for doing things around
your house.

In Indonesia, it’s called *baju rumah* (house
clothes) and these clothes are worn around the house in daytime.

Filipinos call this *pambahay*, literally meaning "for the house".
