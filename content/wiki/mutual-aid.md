## Mutual aid in details

Mutual aid is a situation where you have two or more parties who are on
equal footing, equal power and social standing and worth, giving each
other things that they need for mutual benefit and support. It isn't an
exchange, however, because it doesn't take place in one sitting, and
isn't calculated.

For example, I could help you out with something you need help with,
and my only expectation would be that you, or a friend of yours,
help me out with something I need, some amount of time down the road
(the next time I need help with something).
It doesn't matter what the two things are
(so we don't compare monetary values or labor time or anything)
or how far apart they take place---I could help fix your computer
and you could cook me chicken soup while I'm sick;
or I could [get you enough food](/feeding) to last the week,
and you could let me crash at your place if I'm being kicked out of my
place---as long as
the chain of reciprocity continues.
The only time I'd stop is if I did something for you and you never did anything remotely worth it for me in return
(and that's a flexible limit, too, it doesn't have to be one for one),
which is why you're motivated to reciprocate if you want to keep this mutually beneficial relationship going with me.

Basically, it's a flexible way for resources to flow through social
networks to the places where they are needed from who can spare them.
It's a way of satisfying the "from each according to their ability, to
each according to their need" maxim of communism without having a
central planner or forcing anyone to do anything---because giving
according to your ability motivates others to give to you according to
what you need because if you don't ever get anything in return then
they're just freeloading on you and you don't have to keep giving aid to
them.

Mutual aid requires infrastructure: it need proximity (even virtual
proximity), [community](/community), [friendship](/friendship), and conviviality.

The making of infrastructure is important. Without developing this,
mutual aid tends to devolve into another form of charity.

### With plants!

Robin Wall Kimmerer, botanist and author of *Braiding Sweetgrass*, even
offers indigenous wisdom when she argues for forming a mutual aid with
[plants](/plants) because it "can increase the evolutionary fitness of
both plant and animal."

The agricultural revolution, Kimmerer suggests, is a mutual taming
between plants and humans: plants learned to bear more edible fruits for
humans as humans learned to take care and shape the surroundings with
the aid of plants.

On this note, we know that the earth endows us with gits to sustain our
lives, but it requires still our participation in transforming these
gifts to something we can use or eat, and in making sure that these
gifts exist Tomorrow.

## Gift economy and beyond

Some might say that mutual aid is gift economy, although there might be
more nuance to that.

A gift is a "random" act of kindness, expecting nothing in return. Gift
giving for the sake of it has been frequently frowned upon.
[Capitalism](/Capitalism)/[Empire](/empire) has eroded our trust on
fellow people that both giving and receiving gifts might feel sketchy
for some, and yet... doesn't it feel nice? To remember and be remembered
through gifts, no matter how big or small.

Despite "expecting nothing in return," gift-giving in many cases creates
a bond of reciprocity, not as [*utang na loob*](/dangal)
(in [Filipino values](/filipino-values)) but maybe as a way of remembering other
people in our lives, and wanting them to remember us.

It does not feel right to make it transactional. Or to even
commodify gifts. Humans have the gift *and* responsibility to be
grateful which could start a cycle of reciprocity.

## Mutual aid is different from charity

On the other hand, charity---and many of its recent forms including
[effective altruism](/ea) and longtermism---has a clear power imbalance:
one side, as the "superior" side in wealth and social standing, gives
things out of pity to the other side. This top-down and unidirectional
approach is psychologically harmful to those on the receiving end, and
also makes them dependent on the caprice of the emotions of those who
give, instead of having anything to give in return so as to motivate
them to give. And for those on the giving end, it's more of a virtue
signal or a way to assuage one's conscience than anything that's really
sustainable from a societal perspective.

The best way to ensure that decisions represent the interests of those
they impact is to make sure that theone who are immediately impacted are
the ones making the decisions. The ones with the problem have and are
themselves the solution.

Dean Spade's essay "[Solidarity Not Charity](https://www.deanspade.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Mutual-Aid-Article-Social-Text-Final.pdf)" illuminates more of this.
