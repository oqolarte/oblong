Food is a basic necessity not all of us can afford daily.

Food security is not just about addressing the hunger,
addressing nutrition and calorie intake,
although those are important.
It's also about the [dignity of our communties](/mutual-aid).
We deserve good food for all.

## Ways to help feed hungry unhoused

As advised by a formerly homeless person:

- Offer food in its sealed, original packaging. Do not offer homemade
  items. I don't trust you; you might have malicious intent. I wouldn't
  eat unsealed food; it might literally poison me. I can't afford to get
  sick. I would thank you and not eat it. I would still be hungry, and
  you'll have wasted your resources.
- Lots of homeless people are disabled; many times this comes with
  digestion problems. The disabled homeless have a more challenging time
  getting off the streets and providing for themselves than abled
  homeless. Highly sugary, highly processed foods wreak havoc on the
  dysfunctional digestive system. We often do not have easy, regular
  access to bathrooms. Please don't give us food that hurts us. Common
  food intolerances for the disabled are sugar, gluten, dairy, and red
  meat, though of course this will vary greatly person to person. A
  cheese stick can be excellent, compact energy for an amputee or a
  night of pain and stress around toiletting for someone with IBD. Try
  not to offer multiple common intolerances in one item. If it's one on
  one instead of mass distribution, carrying more than one option allows
  you to offer a choice; it is so, so humanizing to have the luxury of
  choice when homeless. If you end up feeding certain people regularly,
  it is well worth it to ask what they can eat easily.
- Homeless people move around a lot. Can what you're providing be eaten
  while walking? Can it easily be stored in a bag or backpack without
  taking too much space or being too heavy? What kind of mess will it
  make if it spills all over this person's limited belongings? Can it be
  resealed? Can it be squished so much that it becomes difficult to eat
  or extremely messy? Does it require silverware?
- Don't give things that need a stove, oven, or refrigeration to be
  edible. Needing to add hot [water](/water) (like for ramen cups) is usually
  doable as long as it is self-contained. Needing a knife or can opener
  is usually fine.
