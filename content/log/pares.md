Going on a short trip on a not-my-bike is better than not riding out on a Sunday afternoon.
The weather isn't so bad either, hijo.

I have mentally sketched my route based on the errands that I needed to do:
- get the not-my-bike fixed so the rear wheel doesn't wobble;
- buy urinary S/O cat food;
- eat beef pares at Pares House[^loc]

Perhaps, they have less than ideal conditions on the premises,
but the quality of the beef pares has been declining.
It's still good and edible, but at this rate,
we might have to look elsewhere.
