Hearing more songs written and produced by The Weeknd, I'm starting to
think that he's mostly pulling from men's sketchy behavior in relationships. The
fuccboi archetype, particularly. The Weeknd's songs are usually so
sexual in nature, they are used in smuts (*The Idol* and *50 Shades of
Grey* come to mind).

Listening to each, I feel like either I am the "ex-lover" ("ex"), or
it's someone I'm close to; and I have to listen to the persona in this
album complain about all the things this ex is problematic. As for the
ex, I could *understand* the improbability of not escaping this toxic
relationship completely, because each song pulls one back to the blues
and the melodies, to the sweet talk.

*After Hours* is still all that, but on top of it all, there's a clean
veneer of boppy tunes to hide the drama.
