## Intro

Perhaps [talk is cheap](/public-speaking), but action needs going beyond
the convenience the modern-day comforts afford us.

## Adjusting the deed

Sometimes, I wonder about the effectivity of such violent direct
actions. On DEC 2024, Brian Thompson, *former* CEO of UnitedHealthcare,
was gunned downed by someone now dubbed as "The Adjuster." People online
have been sharing jokes, anecdotes, and memes on how The Adjuster might
have pulled one of, if not the greatest performance art of our lives.
(Days later, police arrested Luigi Mangione, supposedly the assassin.)

However, by [writing](/writing), or even thinking, about such a polarizing
idea, I don't mean to glorify merciless [destruction](/destruction),
especially for a [social revolution](/revolution). The caustic ways of
extremism---really, terrorism---do not have a place in ensuring a just
and inclusive world for all beings in the world.

When people with anarchistic tendencies take to terrorism, it puts to
question the entire philosophical and political movement for universal
freedom. Even now, when people hear the term "anarchists," they
associate it with overall unruly violence. This is likely because of the
propaganda of the deed that spiraled out of control on
late 19th century Europe.

But, if the propaganda had attacked the ideas on which our
current systems of oppression stand, I wonder what would happen then.
[Capitalism](/capitalism), [patriarchy](/patriarchy),
militarism, [fascism](/fascism), sexism---each receiving a hypothetical bomb (a
truth bomb?) with hopes of obliterating them.
For when we, as a collective conscious set of living and thinking and
minding beings, finally destroy these systems---or obsolete them, if one
is not fond of destroying---can we begin building worlds anew.
Destruction, viewed this way, then is the most important work, and the
hardest one at that.

To nourish the wants and needs of an individual so that they may
flourish and contribute to their community, the [collective](/community)
must [ensure that all of these basic necessities are met](/mutual-aid).
As "payment" the individual could create beautiful things for the world
to see.

## Calmness as action

Calmness is *also* a form of resistance. While rage can agitate us to
want to do something as soon as possible, being calm (afterwards?) allws
us to focus on what actions to prioritize. Calmness, I would say, is the
counter-weight to rage, and finding the right balance between the two
may just be [what sustains our capacities](/joyful-militancy).

## Peaceful protests

And on that line, we should ask, "Should our protests be calm,
non-violent, and peaceful?"

The cop-out answer is: We should not be policing how each of us should
protest!

A longer answer for your consideration: While out there in the
frontlines, be realistic with how things would go down. Assess whether
you are prepared to be arrested, so you could plan for it in case it
happens (e.g., have a lawyer friend on standby to bail you out). BUT DO
NOT, I repeat, DO NOT wait to be arrested especially if it can be
avoided. Police are a violent bunch; don't be surprised if an initially
peaceful protest gets agitated by these uniformed people.
