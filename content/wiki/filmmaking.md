Because of watching the series Neistat Brothers,
because of watching the great films I have come to like,
I am sometimes motivated to make my own films.

I have no formal background in this area;
I didn't---and won't ever!---go to film school,
so I don't know where to start.

When I try to review films and shows that I watch,
I try to break it down to these components,
so maybe this is where I'll start:

1. [cinematography](/cinematography)
2. soundtrack
3. screenplay
4. [plot](/plot)
5. character development
6. actors and their performance
7. visual effects
8. sound effects
9. editing
10. behind the scenes
