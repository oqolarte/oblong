Many of the parts we walked along in Ermita and Malate in Manila City
smell bad. So many streets have been neglected, save for the trees who
are always generous with their shade, no matter what they are or from
which crack they have been growing, empowering us to walk in the first
place despite the afternoon heat. (As always, thank you, trees!)

With care and attention, the city, as with most urban places, has the
potential to look more beautiful, if not for the adults, for the kids
who deserve to live in a more habitable place.

The city's local government unit (LGU) can start by cleaning the
sidewalks and actually allotting them solely to pedestrians. Of
*fucking* course, expecting LGUs to do that is like waiting for the sun
to rise in Manila Bay; one would rather do the latter. LGUs' motivation
relies heavily in keeping the status quo or enforcing some
[violence](/violence) against the common folk. Keeping the city---all
cities, everywhere---may not just be the most important agenda for the
statespeople, unless it's their own personal backyard. It's up to the
citizens to keep their personal and communal spaces tidy, and hopefully
encourage their neighbors to do the same.
