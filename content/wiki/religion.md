Religion, itself, is not bad.
If you're a Christian, it's worth considering having a personal
relationship with Christ, a direct interaction with God with priest or
pope to act as intermediary, perhaps disregading the church as an
institution altogether.

## Leaders and Organizations

People use religion to maintain their self-image, or at least the idea
of themselves as "good." Often, they too use it to believe that their
actions are "good" even though they are objectively causing harm.
Religious leaders and organizations who use religion as a cudgel and/or
carrot, weaponizing it against the vulnerable and using it to further
their own personal agendas Used this way, religion becomes a barrier to
[accountability](/transformative-justice).

To remain pious, "priests" (or [rigid activists](/joyful-militancy/#rigid-radicalism))
must introduce new moral high grounds to which they will set the current
standards.

## Religion or cult?

Our society primes us for cult abuse through everyday institutions. Any
institution that relies on us submitting to authority, dismissing our
feelings and observations, isolating us, does this. It's no
wonder there are cults across the political spectrum.

## Good religion?

If your faith is compatible with the end goals of [revolution](/revolution),
that is, as long as you believe that dismantling hierarchies and working
towards ending inequality is in line with your teachings,
then there's no reason not to welcome this belief.
If you are standing up to the barriers even within your faith, then even
better.

The people saying that *all* religion is just toxic dogma need to check
themselves.
