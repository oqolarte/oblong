## When other people talk about RSS

- Jan-Erik Rediger's "[rsyncing my RSS feed database](https://fnordig.de/2024/10/28/rsyncing-my-rss-feed-database/)"
- Neil's "[RSS as my default web browser](https://neilzone.co.uk/2022/10/rss-as-my-default-web-browser-for-some-stuff/)"
    - Before stumbling on this, I've actually thought about using my RSS
      feeds as one of my main source of info "out there," even querying
      for topics I'm looking into that others might have already talked
      about. Of course, the querying part is not nearly as good as a
      dedicated search engine.
