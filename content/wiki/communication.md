Notes on tools and techniques for effective communication.

## Writing as a medium

...is my main form of creating,
of expressing myself,
be it for public or private eyes.

[Writing](/writing) scales well.
I try to put effort no matter
how big or small the body of text I'm writing.

For non-fiction, keep intros to a minimum (or zero) and get to the main
point as soon as you can.

## People?

[Talking to people](/public-speaking) can get [frustrating](/frustration),
especially via internet where everyone seems to be in perpetual [debate](/debate)
with one another,
and more so in many of the social media platforms.
Just don't give up on them.
"[Because there isn't a perfect solution to a people problem.](https://seths.blog/2022/11/people-problems-are-complicated-problems/)"

Still, there is no illegitimate perspective! Share your own and encourage
others to do the same. If you are feeling something, someone else is
feeling it, too.

We can't lower all hurdles to accommodate everyone's ability and/or
sensibilities. But also, destructive speech makes people feel like
fools, and it turns them away from what you want to say.
Speak clearly and with little fluff, but never simpler.

### Connecting via mainstream social media

Many people who use the internet have no idea how it's
[technology](/technology) works. And that's perfectly fine if their
online communication is contained within Facebook or Instagram.
They have other skills to share and lives to live outside of tech,
but they also have the right to have private lives,
[away from the surveillance of Big Tech](/infosec), whether they know about it or not.

## Storytelling

[The significance of plot without conflict](https://stilleatingoranges.tumblr.com/post/25153960313/the-significance-of-plot-without-conflict)
is also a good thing to note when unraveling a narrative.

Also, [everything is *content* now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAtbFwzZp6Y), apparently,
but asserting that may be harmful to the creative output.
For example, a novel will never be the same as a tweet.
Calling them both content "levels" the field badly.
"Creating content" is also [marketing](/mr) speak, something that must
be avoided.

> because they talk about an impermanence, something that we just flush
> through, and has to keep moving. And in my world, a beautiful work of
> [audiovisual storytelling](/filmmaking) should hold its place next to a novel or a
> painting.

## Email

If email is an integral part of your workflow,
consider [using plaintext](https://useplaintext.email).
Plaintext is widely accepted in many devices and applications,
and is low on bandwidth.

Matt Might shares a brief explainer on
[how to send and reply to email](http://matt.might.net/articles/how-to-email/).

Before sending a question via email,
look it up online.
Also check any available [documentation](/documentation) on the matter,
and see if you can find the answer there yourself.

Keep emails short,
with an informative subject that's about 70 characters.
Try to keep the body two to five sentences.

Place action items on top.
