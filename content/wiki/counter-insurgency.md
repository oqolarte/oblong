> This field manual/Marine Corps war-fighting publication
> establishes doctrine (fundamental principles)
> for military operations in a counterinsurgency (COIN) environment.
> It is based on lessons learned from previous counterinsurgencies
> and contemporary operations.
> It is also based on existing interim doctrine
> and doctrine recently developed.
> Counterinsurgency operations generally have been neglected in broader
> American military doctrine and national security policies
> since the end of the Vietnam War over 30 years ago.
> This manual is designed to reverse that trend.
> It is also designed to merge traditional approaches to COIN
> with the realities of a new international arena shaped
> by technological advances, globalization,
> and the spread of extremist ideologies-some of them claiming
> the authority of a religious faith.
> Doctrine by definition is broad in scope and involves principles,
> tactics, techniques, and procedures applicable worldwide.
> Thus, this publication is not focused on any region or country
> and is not intended to be a standalone reference.
> Users should assess information from other sources
> to help them decide how to apply the doctrine in this publication
> to the specific circumstances facing them.

In his article [*Anarchist Calisthenics*](https://web.archive.org/web/https://harpers.org/archive/2012/12/anarchist-calisthenics/),
James Scott briefly suggests that we should "break some trivial law" daily,
because this prepares us for that one big *crime*
that we will have to do in the future,
the one that we're bound to do because,
even though the state has declared it illegal,
it would be the only moral thing to do.
