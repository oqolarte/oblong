## Pros of not having a corpo job

One of the millions of perks of not having a corpo job is that I revert
to a flexible life. Family and friends know this, so they sometimes invite me to
attend events and gatherings.

## Hanging out with MISMO

The annual December holidaze turns every road into a vibrant parking
lot. Public transportation becomes more jarring. Vulnerable road users
remain vulnerable.

How do we deal with this?

This, and more, was what we tried to talk about when I hung out with
core [MISMO](https://www.instagram.com/makeitsafermovement/) members
this week. I say "tried", because the flow of discussion went wherever
it needed to go, and we all agreed that it was for the better. One of us
said that they appreciated how loosely organized MISMO currently is, and
that that is a feature not a bug. That we are not rigid about what we
want to accomplish while still respecting other people's concerns is one
of the most important things that make a movement safer and more
sustainable for its members.

## Panatang Luntian Year End Party

[Panatang Luntian](https://www.instagram.com/panatangluntian/) (PaLu, or
literally "green promise" in English) is a coalition "which aims to
journey towards bigger, bolder actions in defense of the environment."
MISMO is a member of this coalition. Aly of MISMO extended the
invitation to me.

It feels like a networking event, and on some levels, it was. But
everyone was chill and mostly non-binary about it.

One of the hosts noticed the print on black shirt I was wearing: "Animal
Liberation" with a red outline of a bunny. Aly, within earshot, jokingly
said something to the effect of: "You fight for a lot of things, don't
you?"

I said, "Yes, because everything is connected."

Later on, during the closing remarks of the program, the same host I was
talking to acknowledged me: "And like what ohio said, 'everything is *in
relationship with each other*.'"

So I went from being a newbie to being *#quoted* in about an hour. Another
friend joked that I just did an "influencer speedrun."

## Dinner party with friends

Bellini's at Cubao Expo was either generous with their salt, or the
cooks that night were not into their sauce game. But that's fine (not
really; menu is expensive). Some friends agreed. We could not wait to
get out.

Roasting each other over Cards Against Humanity with a tall glass of
locally brewed beer (at Cubao X Brewery) more than made up for the
spoonfuls of salt garnished with pasta and viscous stuff at Bellini's,
thankfully. Contrary to popular belief, [friendships](friendship) grow
stronger through each gameplay. If you believe otherwise, something ill
has probably jaundiced the relationship anyway. I was (and still am)
proud of myself for contributing to the collective banter and dark
humor, going so far as calling winners "horrible," lovingly, of course.

## Cons of not having a corpo job

One of the few downsides of not having a corpo job is earning zero
money.
