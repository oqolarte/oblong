Have you ever felt that you started something that went bigger than
you'd expect it to be? People have begun consuming it, even integrating
parts of it in their daily lives, wishing for it, becoming *it* without
knowing its roots---you, a mean meme machine before it was even a
thing, the fertile soil from which this hypothetical thing bloomed and
flourished. Of course, those who are witnessing it are not interested in
the origin story. Understandable. They are here and now, with the
intention of joining the cause.

## What is lost is transformed, actually

Lost loves, encompassing all kinds, or the idea of love being lost has
to be anchored to something oppressive and possessive that fears the
importance of liberation. Like energy, what we know as love can only be
transformed from one kind to another. If this exists---and I have all
the reasons that it does---it would only cease to exist if all life with
some signifcant level of emotional intelligence to experience it also
ceases to exist. Without all the actors and observers, the reality
within which love is experienced will not matter.
