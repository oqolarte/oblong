## Global north's cheat code

Businesses in global north have been outsourcing a chunk of the "boring
work" in their processes to Latin America, India, Philippines, and other
English-speaking countries in the global south. Apparently, this is a
"cheat code"[^cheat], and the use is obvious: to gain maximum
productivity for the cheapest cost.

[^cheat]: If by "cheat" you mean being thoroughly unfair to desparate
people, then I would accept the term.

USD 5/hr is not bad by local rates, yes, but it also means that these
employers do not think our time is worth the same as theirs. Following
the profit incentive, this tactic makes sense; otherwise, BPO industries
would not have flourished. Framed differently though, if
you want to enjoy life, you should be more desparate. That is why I am not
for the profit incentive of the already privileged, to say the least.

## *Adventure Time*

Netflix *nihil*---I recently restarted watching *Adventure Time* when I
have the capacity to do so. It is all harmless [absurd fun](/absurdism)
that may or may not contain gems that only adults would detect,
depending on how they deep they would read into it.

Sometimes, I pause and reflect if a scene is meant to say something
deep. When I unpause, I realize that in the end, it does not really
matter, as long as all the drawings and the colors are fun and cute, and
the dialogue chill.
