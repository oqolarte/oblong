When and where in life did I not wait for anything?
Waiting *is* the norm.
And as is the norm, I, too, wait for things to come to our doorstep:
things for a small weekend project that I plan to document and share;
people to show up and finally make good with their words;
luck to turn up and take a good swat on the bad spirits
that fail to understand that we, from time to time,
deserve a breather.

## Small Weekend Project

We've been meaning to replace our water station with a more robust one,
made from stainless steel materials,
equipped with ceramic filters.
As I write this, we're still waiting for the few remaining parts
before the assembly can begin.

It's weird that it took me this long to finally push through with this.
I tend to always look out for the best buy,
like how *lola* taught us,
but in so doing,
I was indeed paralyzed by analysis.

This is what I tell myself:
Water is such an integral part of existence,
it only makes sense for us to invest this much time, money, and effort
in building a sustainable solution that will last for a long time.

## On people showing up

Weekend rainfall triggered floods in many parts of Metro Manila,
including in and near the areas where I live.
In fact, it had gotten so bad that a nearby creek overflowed,
flooding the adjacent road,
causing traffic.
We even saw a rescue team, complete with a motorboat,
arriving at the bridge. I hope no one was hurt.

I wouldn't blame people for not showing up as scheduled;
the water almost got inside our house,
and it probably would had the rain not stopped.
It's because of this that
I told my mother to cancel their plans of visiting
[here](/feb2022-photos/#day-19).

## Where is the Luck?

What I first thought was a mild drizzle that dampened the mood became worse later.
The sun, and hope for being productive, hid behind big gray clouds.
Or was it *the* volcanic smog from Taal Volcano?
Does it matter?

I had planned to run some errands before I start on my new work,
but like I said, the weekend didn't pan out well for many of us.
I also knew I didn't want to risk getting stuck outside.
Bad weather, depending on one's privilege at any point in time,
can be an excuse to back out on plans.
