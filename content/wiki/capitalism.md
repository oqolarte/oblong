Capitalism is, whether we like it or not, a strong idea that most of us
[are coerced to] agree on,
[an elaborate Ponzi scheme](https://crimethinc.com/posters/capitalism-is-a-pyramid-scheme) that shapes our
lives and the space around us, by extracting from them to feed
the profit incentive---an endless growth on finite resources which, in
reality, cannot be sustained.

It has caused many deaths, and yet it is not [our deaths](/death) that
the elite class fear but our lives. Alive, we can be learning and
kicking to topple the oppression.

## Anti-capitalist affirmations

And now, for something completely different.

- I am allowed to spend my time creating things, even if they are not
  beautiful.
- There is [no such thing as a "real job."](/anti-work). All forms of
  work are real and valid.
- There is nothing that I need to accomplish to be worthy. I am already
  worthy.
- Doing nothing is good for my soul.
- I am not defined by what I produce.
- My worth cannot be measured by my paycheck, my job title, or a list of
  professional or academic achievements.
- I do not need to monetize my hobbies. It is enough to spend time doing
  something I love.
- I will not let society decide what success looks like. I can define
  what successful life looks like for me.
