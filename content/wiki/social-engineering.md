Bad actors use social engineering to get what they want, usually a piece
of information like a password, by manipulating your emotions through
[communication](/communication). This can be done in a number of ways,
and the list below is non-exhaustive:

1. Emails containing links to malicious sites mimicking the look and
   feel of it, like banking sites.
2. Phone calls in which the caller would pretend to be a legitimate
   employee (e.g., a technician or service agent) of a well-known company.
3. SMS (text messages) containing links to malicious sites
4. Shoulder-surfing, or someone looking over the shoulder of another
   when the latter is doing important stuff on their device, like
   inputting a password or PIN
