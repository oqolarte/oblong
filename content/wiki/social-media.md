## In the beginning

Age reveal without age reveal---I remember when social networking sites
like Friendster and Yahoo Messenger were fun ways of keeping in touch
with classmates and friends after school hours.

Even when we all started migrating to Facebook, it was just this thing that
we did for a few hours, before eventually logging out to do other
things in the real world.

Now, it's safe to say that a lot has changed. The biggest social media
platforms are designed to retain users for as long as possible, because
our attention means interaction, and interaction means more data for
them to analyze. More data means personalized ads for you and me.

## Monetizing our data

Who does not like seeing the things what our friends and family are up
to these days?
Do we not light up when they talk about something we love [to hate]?
Social connection is important to us, and social media platforms have
become the digital bridges that collapses distance and time between two
people.

At the cost of their data.

Our attention spans have been commodified. Unless you're using an
ad blocker, the internet will bombard you with targeted ads no thanks to
the data brokers who have bought a dossier of you, likely from the likes
of Google, Facebook, and other big tech companies.

Everything now can be a brand, and everyone who dreams of making it big
in social media must establish (i.e., [market themselves to be profitable](/mr))
their "[personal brand](/personal-brand)" and see to it themselves, lest they deal with
doppelgangers and be on the losing end.

To keep us engaged, an algorithm is baked into the design of a social
media platform. No one really fully understands how an algorithm works,
except that it keeps a tally of what types of "content" a user usually
interacts with, and from this input feeds it into a black box that
outputs a feed that the user will likely engage with more. Like I said,
the key is to retain users, and the algorithm is the main tool for that.

If you are interacting with friends, families, or even strangers, in
social media, but are using it through a colorful, algorithmically
personalized feed, are you sure it benefits everyone involved, or is it
just the cheap thrill of chasing dopamine that pushes the loneliness
away, if only for a while?

People who use social media as work---the so-called influencers and
content creators---are stuck in appeasing the algorithm, creating more
"content" in unhealthy rates to stay relevant.

### Surveillance

So, is monetization, then, the problem?

Not necessarily, I think.

I think there are a few important questions to ask: Who owns the means of
production? Who owns these social media platforms, and what are they
doing with all the data they are gathering from their userbase?

Also, if we're using social media through our phones, [how do they get our data](/surveillance)?

To that last question, Savva Pistolas offers some insights in their write-up "[Pointing at the mushrooms - Identifying our own digital colonisation](https://pistolas.co.uk/mushroom/)" (emphasis mine):

> While social media is objectively consuming your usage data to produce
> tailored advertisements - up to and including your message content,
> what you're viewing, how you scroll, and who you're talking to, it is
> **not recording your voice in the background**.
> 
> [...]
> 
> It would be so much less worrisome if social media privacy abuse was
> as simple as recording you and spitting adverts back at you, but it is
> far more sophisticated and resource efficient than that. We are
> correct to assume that our phones 'observe us'. It's not using the
> microphone though, it's certainly not 'interacting' with you, **it's
> just accepting everything that you're offering up to it**.

## Parasocial media?

There's also the concern of how "social" really is social media.

More and more, by amplifying rage through the algorithm, it has pit us
against one another with hate, *while* facilitating the arena in which
we digitally spew vitriol, in exchange for attention and engagement.

## To destroy the master's house using master's tools

For those against the surveillance capitalism, whether enabled by parasocial
media, is it even productive to spread propaganda within their platforms?

Yes, I believe so, with caveats.

If we are to start convincing people to fight a worthy cause---be it in
dismantling the capitalism or [abolishing the empire](/abolition),
first we meet them everywhere and
everywhen they gather.

We can still use these platforms as media to propagate radical ideas,
but we must not forget we are still playing by the house's rules.
Moreover, we need to be aware of the possibility of putting more value
than what's necessary to public performance.
JP Hill reminds us in his essay (with the title being a reminder in itself) "[Social media is the house that always wins](https://www.jphilll.com/p/social-media-is-the-house-that-always)" that information alone cannot win a fight.

### POSSE

If anything, [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) (Publish (on your) Own
Site, Syndicate Elsewhere) is a good startegy from the IndieWeb when
using social media platforms in conjunction with a dedicated website or
blog that is outside of big tech. In his post "[Reconsidering POSSE](https://starbreaker.org/grimoire/entries/reconsidering-posse/index.html),"
Matthew Graybosch writes about how he (or anyone) "need[s] not syndicate
to such [social media] platforms [like Mastodon or Bluesky]" but can do
so to dedicated blogging platforms like [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev/), [Write.As](https://write.as/), or
[Dreamwidth](https://www.dreamwidth.org/); or to a newsletter service like [Buttondown](https://buttondown.com/).
