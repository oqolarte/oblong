Hello again, after an almost two-week hiatus.

I *try* to have the simplest and most boring workflow, because, I think,
it's more sustainable for me. But no, life demands variability and
volatility. This is achieved with Father Time increasing entropy across
the board, and Mother Nature promising chaos to thrive in all levels of
existence.

## Ador Status

My personal laptop, [Ador](/64), on which I do personal things, like
updating the files for this blog, has been wiped clean, because of my
committing several noob errors:

1. Installing Alpine Linux edge as main production, which is
   discouraged; and
2. Not doing regular back-up of my data and files.

In the days that followed setting Ador back up, I went
distro-[s]hopping, trying to find the right one. So, I went through the
usual suspects:
- Fedora (too bloated)
- Arch (hard drive encryption not working somehow?)
- OpenBSD (keyboard not working and/or stuck in boot)

I eventually cycled back to Alpine Linux, stable version, not edge,
where software incompatibility can and will break the operating system.

I am still sulking at the loss of my semi-important files.

## Reading many books at once

In the meantime, while I was still setting up Ador, I took to reading.

Reading 3 or 4 different books simultaneously has given me the ability
to connect ideas across them, possibly creating new innovative ideas, at
least interesting thoughts to discuss with peers.

And annotation! Why haven't I done that before?
Taking notes about the text I am reading is like having a conversation
with the ideas or interacting with the plots.
And I feel like since I'm doing it the analog way, i.e. with physical
books, pen and sticky notes, reading doesn't get too boring too quickly.
