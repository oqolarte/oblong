## Review of *Klara and the sun*

I have recently finished reading *Klara and the sun* by Kazuo Ishiguro.
Below is a brief no-spoilers review of the sci-fi novel.

I like how Ishiguro explores the possibility of a more human(e),
spiritual even, side of Artificial Intelligence. Like how, as of
writing, we use generative AI as tools to achieve specific outcomes,
the story's dystopia has found a way to utilize AI as "friends",
always there when you need them.

There are also interesting sub-plots that mirror our issues today,
at least one of which shocked me as it seemed out of place (for me).
Another one reminded me of that time when I was left with my *lola*
because my parents went abroad to work. I felt lonely then, badly in
need of friends around my age. Sometimes, I get to hangout with my
cousins who lived next door, but those seldom happened.

The readers are invited to analyze their own beliefs as they go through
the philosophy presented to them.

Finishing the book gave me almost the same feeling after reading
*Never Let Me Go*, also by Ishiguro.
Indeed, the two novels share similar themes.

Finally, I recommend the book to people who tries to look in and out of
themselves for "what it means to love."

## *Bili Bili* at Cubao X

Gone last 19 Aug to [Bili Bili](https://www.instagram.com/bilibilikayodyan/) (Instagram link) event.
It was a relatively short trip comprising of browsing stickers and
zines, and sweating heaps with mounds of strangers dressed for the weekend.

I bought two zines from the stall of artist [Dione Kong](https://linktr.ee/dionekong) (Linktree link).
In their stall, they had a wire mesh where their artwork were displayed.
I didn't see anyone when I approached the stall.
So I might've been visibly surprised when a person hiding behind the
mesh beamed "Hello!"
They joked,
"We're now ready to take your confession."
We laughed. I paid for the two zines, and off I went.

Much, much later, *l'esprit de l'escalier* finally came to me with a
could've-been perfect reply to the confession quip:
"Forgive me, Father, for I have zine'd."
