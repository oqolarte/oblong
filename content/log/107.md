A co-worker in their boredom sent me a screenshot from Facebook.
It's a post that roughly translates to:
"We will be moving to our new office,
but the comfort rooms don't have bidets.
Shall I look for another job?"

It's funny because:
1. co-worker said it reminded them of me,
who have preached half-jokingly about the importance of bidets
in all of the out-of-office gatherings that we workmates have had;
2. the OP[^op] (of the screenshot) considered (half-jokingly?) that the absence of bidet
in their new office warrants a job hop; and
3. our office is set to transfer to a new location by end of year,
confirmed to be a bidet non-haver.

Don't you find it odd that many property owners have the budget
for new buildings, but not for bidets in every water closet?

Do their managements aim for some green-building certification
by achieving some vague KPI about water conservation?
My friends still working in that industry seem to think so,
but they're not so sure either.

At this point, I don't think it matters that much.
No building can ever be "green."
The moment that its construction begins cuts off its chances at being
sustainable to practically nil.
Might as well be generous and provide some bidets, *no*?
