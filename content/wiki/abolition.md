Abolition means a world with no police and no prisons, and the necessary
steps we need to make it possible eventually. It's neither police nor
prison reform; it means uprooting those two which are based on the
old-think of punishing the harm-doer, and ensuring these institutions
won't be needed again ever.

## How laws can be destructive

Laws (both coercive and punitive) are created to protect money, private
property and property rights, and the resultant pursuit of material
self-interest---all of which when extracted or taken from the commons
(usually in a destructive, violent way) and the fruits of which are not
shared back to the community, will result in greed and hunger for power.
This is because hoarding of wealth would grant the owner control over
others, but not without gaining the risk of instability, perhaps in the
form of envy. It is because of this risk that maintaining and growing
wealth is a negative feedback loop, which at one point must necessarily
collapse at the expense of many lives.

While we criticize the need for laws (institutionalized), that is not to
say that we don't need rules (fluid, not necessarily set in stone,
community-led).

## On prisons

Prisons as they exist now are crimes against humanity, designed to
*require* cruelty from those that operate it daily---including guards,
wardens, doctors and other medical workers, and other laborers in
between---and they need to be abolished regardless of the fallout.
Whatever shape or form the prison industrial complex takes, we can be
sure that it will strip its prisoners off of their humanity. Throwing
people in them can never be in the name of justice.

Many crimes today exist because of systemic issues.
[With tighter community](/community)
and building spaces where both kids and adults can flourish
and express themselves,
crimes would be less likely to happen as
[people would be looking out for each other](/mutual-aid).
And anyway, the current (in)[justice](/transformative-justice) system
barely solves half of the cases; jails don't stop people now.

## Why "no police"

The police, as the state-sanctioned monopoly on violence, exists solely
to protect the interests of those in power and maintain existing social
and economic order.

Imagine: they get in their "riot suits" and commit [violence](/violence)
against police protest. It is happening, so imagine no more.

If you are privileged, it's unlikely for you or your social circle to
have had direct negative experience with the police. They mostly target
the victims of classism, sexism, and in many countries, racism, and the
activists that help those. And we pay for this violence through taxes.

Police also enforce all laws in which 99% of us had no say. Many of
these laws, then, do not really aim to better our lives but only those
who made them, lawmakers who don't fully represent us except maybe when
our wellbeing somehow tangents briefly to their agenda.
