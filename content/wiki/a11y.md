- Is it possible to recast disability as differently abled?
    - Not because we want to soften the hit and beveling the pointed
      corners of what it means to be a person with disabilities (PWDs),
      but being outside of of what is considered normal opens up new
      possibilities. The last bit hopefully does not sound like I am
      glorifying disabilities. But listening to PWDs and creating spaces
      that include their inputs benefit everyone.
- Convenience is not necessarily the same as accessibility.
    - Making life hyper-efficient because it means more convenience is
      just transferring the risks to the more vulnerable people in the
      population.
    - Optimizing for efficiency is addiction to productivity, itself at
      tool of capitalism that is always hungry for More, demands More,
      until we are No More.
    - We can build accessible spaces for everyone, here IRL ("in real
      life") and in the digital space, without polishing all the knobs,
      so to speak, that they are all ultra-clean. Riffing off of the
      knob metaphor, actual knobs are not too friendly to people who may
      have weaker or non-existent grips; lever door handles are more
      accessible.
    - We need enough friction, in all sense of the word,
      because it is the process with which we can grow as individuals
      and as members of a larger community.
- Frictionlessness---or just comforts---of our lives is like having a
  clean space to live in in which cleaning really just means displacing
  the dirt and unwanted stuff to some place else that we hope to not see
  again. The friction, represtented by dirt and clutter, does not
  disappear; it is absorbed by that Dirty Place. To be clear, the
  Dirty Place is just a catchall phrase to mean a place where many of us
  would not rather be in. Sadly, the less fortunate, people in abject
  poverty usually have nowhere else to go but the Dirty Place.
