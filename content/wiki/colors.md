- I vaguely remember the striking feeling that yellow allowed me to
  experience when I was a kid, but the soft thud remains there at the
  back of my mind. It is a happy color, then and now, to me. So while
  the minute details have long since vanished, the positive feeling is
  something I could still see from afar.
- Yellow, I was told back then, was not exactly a "boy's color". So, I
  had to look around and pick another one. I did not know the
  implications of this, but this was one of my earliest memories of
  gender norms.
- "Girls should only be X; boys should only be Y." As simple as it may
  seem, that quote was a big concept for me to grasp. But the adults in
  my life, both men and women, continued to hammer what they believed
  the do's and dont's of each gender to every young person within their
  sphere of influence. And their truths mattered.
- However, what comprise boy's colors, no one could truly say. A close
  relative's favorite color is green. He drinks too much alcohol for his
  own good. Is green a boy's color? Is drinking alcohol the pathway to
  manhood? Another relative, his favorite color is blue. He is a proud
  smart, sensitive, gay man who has accomplished many things. Where,
  then, along the binary of boy-girl does that put blue?
- Not too far along the color wheel---and being a kid, I still have a
  small pallette---I found red. With it came big ideas like courage,
  anger, blood. *Boy's stuff*". Not too long after that, I encountered the cartoon
  show *Courage the Cowardly Dog*. Despite some of the episodes too
  jarring and out-there for my young sensibilities, I came to enjoy the series.
  The titular Courage was not red, but a shade of purple. He was
  cowardly, yes, but do we not all need fear to do the
  courageous "things we do for love"? Where in the gender spectrum,
  then, does that put the color purple? Also, can one big idea inhabit
  two colors in the wheel?
- As a kid from the lower-middle class (if we are to believe that the
  entire middle class does exist, and having a gradient at that), I was
  only exposed to the cheap eight-crayon box of Crayola because it was
  the only coloring tool we could afford. Imagine, then,
  the awe that I felt when a gracious distant aunt gifted us the
  64-crayon box. All these colors with funny and exciting labels: peach,
  lime green, flesh, magenta, maroon. Who knew fruits other than orange
  can be a color name? (Going back to Courage, he would  be a *star apple* if we are going with this.)
- Now as an adult, I do not know what my favorite color is. I am not
  sure if it is still red, or a specific shade of red. If my small
  wardrobe is any indication, I am drawn nowadays to dark colors, mostly
  black, not because I have grown villainous towards the world around
  me, but mostly because I find black... the right amount of worldliness
  and humility, if that makes sense. Of course, I am still drawn to
  vivid pallettes: artworks that come alive with contrasting hues;
  cinematography with impossible yet lively color grading; designs that
  surprise you with the right pop of accent color, etc.
