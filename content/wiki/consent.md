## No consent is more efficient *but* not ethical

In the age of Getting Things Done at the [speed of Profit](/capitalism),
asking for consent is [revolutionary](/revolution). This act asks you to
be patient and understanding, instead of blitzing through
your own agenda with complete disregard to other people involved. That's
why people who rise to power often manufacture it, through advertising
(or propaganda, same thing).

Is it really more efficient to make decisions without getting the inputs
of all parties involved? There's a Japanese saying, "**急がば回れ**
(*Isogaba maware*)" which in English is roughly, "If in a hurry, take the
long way round." That is, if we are more deliberate, more thoughtful,
taking in considerations of and from people, it is more effective in the
long term even if it takes a while to reach the goals.

For those of us who have been on the receiving
end of top-down decisions, we know that such moves can be
alienating, making us contest the entire process. This might lead to
lack of support for the decision made for us, ultimately putting
said "efficiency" to question.

## Getting consent is more human

By using consensus, we make better decisions
and [build stronger community](/community).

Consent is not a one-time thing;
it must be [cleary communicated](/communication)
through all parties concerned whenever
necessary, because things change: people's capacities, environments in
which contexts come and go, culture, living situations, etc.

Waiting for the right time can also be a form of consent.

When relationships begin to crack and break down because of lack of
consent, we must pause and examine the dynamics that lead up to this
point, how we can sort these out to ensure all are equally powerful, and
no one holds another over the other.

## Categories of consent

Emily Nagoski shares categories of consent:
[enthusiastic, willing, unwilling, coerced](https://web.archive.org/web/20140523222113/http://enagoski.wordpress.com:80/2011/04/30/enthusiastic-willing-unwilling-coerced/).

She talks about this mostly in the context of sex, but I'm sure it can
be expanded to other social arrangements as well.

### Enthusiastic consent

- "I *want* to..."
- "I don’t fear the consequences of saying yes OR saying no."
- "Saying no means missing out on something I want."

### Willing consent

- "I care about you though I don’t *want* to... (right now)."
- "I fear or dread the consequences of saying no and I don’t fear the
  consequences of saying yes."
- "I believe that want may begin after I say yes."

### Unwilling consent

- "I fear the consequences of saying no more than I fear the
  consequences of saying yes."
- "I feel not just an absence of desire but an absence of desire for
  desire."
- "I hope that by saying yes, you will stop bothering me, or that if I
  say no you’ll only keep on trying to persuade me."

### Coerced consent

- "You threaten me with harmful consequences if I say no."
- "I feel I’ll be hurt if I say yes, but I’ll be hurt more if I say no."
- "Saying yes means experiencing something I actively dread."
