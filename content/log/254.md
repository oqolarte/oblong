Recently, I rewatched *Sherlock Holmes* films directed by Guy Ritchie,
and I have to jot down my thoughts about it. For
the record, I like the second one a bit more.

I am rereading some
texts of the canon authored by Doyle, although it's likely I won't go
through all of it.

I have now grown more mature and acquired more perspectives with which
to examine the roles of detectives since I last saw the movies many
years ago.

## Role of detectives

The way I see it, detectives, even of Holmes's caliber, deliver justice
via state's police into the prison industrial complex. As a "consulting
detective," untangling knots in cases was Holmes's means of earning an
income. Both
directly and indirectly, he had been state's agent.

On at least one story, *"[The Final Problem](https://www.eastoftheweb.com/short-stories/UBooks/FinaProb.shtml)"*---the
one in which he met Professor Moriarty---did Holmes take justice into
his own hands but not without risking his life. In the real world, do we
need to lose [a part of] ourselves just to get/give what we all deserve,
to not contend with more evil roaming and modifying our realities?

I think that modern-day evil draws its power from the current systems of
[Empire](/empire). So maybe, if we desire to reduce the amount of evil
in this world, we need to [work on dismantling the Empire now](/prefiguration).

## What I want to see

Now, I don't claim to be a superfan of detective fiction, so I'm not
sure about its diversity out there, but I hope there would be more out
there with justice-seeking plot device that
[transforms](/transformative-justice) rather than
[incarcerates](/abolition) or, worse, [annihilates](/destruction).

More wishlist for detective fiction:
- has no deaths;
- has BIPoC non-men as major characters;
- is not just set in Global North;
- has major characters without any harmful addictions;
- doesn't involve violating personal liberties (e.g., [privacy](/privacy), [security](/security))
- has sleuthing with the goal of keeping people *out* of jails

## The politics of detection

Notice how police departments don’t care about crime. Or if they do,
it's to justify the incentives they are taking from taxes.

They don't care even
in the colloquial sense of “antisocial acts hurt people." Not even in
the legal sense of “acts that politicians don’t approve of” like in
Duterte's brutal [war on drugs](/drugwar) which claimed the lives of
many Filipinos, including innocent ones.

Police departments go after criminals, sure, but criminals who do *not*
belong to their group. Unsurprisingly at this point, they *do* go after
innocent people who don’t belong to their group. Oddly, they also go
after their own kind if said kind happens to be a "good cop," just like
in the case of Houston Tipping of Los Angeles Police Department. And
most importantly, they protect criminals who belong to their group. For
more info, see the following links:

- Hacktibista PH's [list of PNP & AFP's Abuses, Brutality, Impunity, Human Rights Violations and Alleged State-Sponsored Killings and Violence](https://hacktibista.ph/abuses), latest on 2021 but obviously continues up to today
- On Houston Tipping's murder: [An LAPD officer who was killed in a training exercise was targeted, a lawyer alleges](https://www.npr.org/2022/10/08/1127580159/houston-tipping-lapd-death-lawsuit)
"Their group" is as large as the ruling class and as personal as
able-bodied cisgender heterosexual.

Under capitalism and authoritarianism, we can observe that skilled
workers, including investigators of all types, are kept underpaid,
under-resourced, and in unappreciated positions. Meanwhile, people in
the Higher Ups promote unjust authority to keep us and even their own in
check. If there ever was a motion to investigate any abuses of power,
purging the ranks would be deemed necessary.

## Some "detectives" in fiction I've liked

(That is, those that don't have Sherlock Holmes in them, and possibly
stretch the job description of what a detective actually does.)

Anyway, going back now to the fiction. I like it the way I like
reggae---usually I stick to the really good ones, which I admit is
highly subjective. And even then, not always.

### *Disco Elysium*

[*Disco Elysium*](https://fitgirl-repacks.site/disco-elysium/) is a role-playing, dialogue-heavy video game, about two
detectives solving a crime. I really like this one, and meant to do more
than one playthroughs, if only my PC then did not die on me. Then again,
the main character doesn't inhibit himself from entering
self-destruction as he and his partner goes around the city looking for
answers.

### *Twin Peaks*

[*Twin Peaks*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Peaks) (TV series by David Lynch) offers another flavor of detective
fiction, this time laced with [surrealism](/surrealism) and absurd amounts of good
diner coffee. I only finished Season 1 many years ago. With Lynch's recent
passing, I ought to see the whole thing to the end, *no*?

The catch: the main character is, uhm, a literal state agent (from FBI).

### Hannibal Lecter's universe

I have only seen [*The Silence of the Lambs*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Silence_of_the_Lambs_(film)) (1991 film), [*Red Dragon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dragon_(2002_film))
(2002 film), and [*Hannibal*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_(TV_series)) (Season 1, 2013).

In all them, catching the bad guys require the investigators to work
with a criminal, a literal cannibal at that.

### *Lie to me*

[*Lie to me*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_to_Me) gives us a
consultant/scientist that, alas, works for investigators in solving
crimes through his work in applied psychology. I have only seen Season
1, but I heard it gets better.

### *Scooby-doo* (and the gang)

I've only ever watched *some* episodes of the [*Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scooby-Doo,_Where_Are_You!) cartoon
at Cartoon Network back when it was cooler (for me).
It's a bunch of kids and their big dog getting into sticky
situations with white weirdos (mostly men, if I remember correctly) who
like to cosplay freaky creatures.
The kids would unmask the white psycho- and sociopaths
at the end of each episode.

## Possible real world alternatives

I imagine that sleuthing may be a fulfilling career in this messy,
cobwebby world we humans have shaped for ourselves. ACAB, but also
ideological purity rarely achieves anything. So here
are a few possible alternatives that attempts to find a balance:

- Private investigators would refuse to be mercenaries for state's law
  enforcement agents. They also wouldn't work with criminals which, I
  guess is already mostly addressed if they didn't work for the state.
- A community of [open source intelligence](/osint) enthusiasts and
  experts uncover war crimes of a rogue nation, collaborating over
  internet.
- Investigative journalists foil the harms being done by Empire, like
  human trafficking, modern slavery, genocide, environmental
  catastrophes, etc.
- A group of teens, as part of their neighborhood watch, would go and
  find missing pets of people (e.g., old people, people with
  disabilities) who might not have the energy to do it themselves.
- Explore alternative yet radical ways of living with each other, like
  [mutual aid](/mutual-aid), drastically reducing crime rates, so that
  we can step toward obsoleting the empire.

Feel free to shoot me an email if you think of more, and I'll add them.
