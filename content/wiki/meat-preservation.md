Meat is animal muscle consisting of water, protein, and fat.
When cooked, most meat products still retains about half of their
moisture, enough to be home for micro-organisms.

Preserving meat, thus, involves removing or limiting the moisture (i.e.,
water) in it. Known processes that don't need electricity include
drying, salting, and smoking.

## Drying

Drying can reduce the moisture content of meat to 3 - 10%, but a piece
of meat must be thinly sliced, so that it has higher surface area. This
prevents crusting, which prevents the drying of inner meat if a slice is
cut too thick. [Jerky](/beef-jerky) is the most common dried meat.

## Curing

Curing is at least two processes in one, salting and smoking. Meat is
salted by either dry (salt rubbed on meat's surface) or wet curing (meat is soaked in 15 - 20% brine). Sugar and spices can also be added to affect
the color and flavor. The meat is preserved in sugar or salt and
nitrates or nitrites, which also prevent microbial growth.

## Smoking

Smoking is usually done after salting. It's important to control the
temperature when smoking meat---high enough to prevent microbial growth,
low enough to not cook the meat.


1. hot smoking (50-85 oC) for less than an hour to several hours;
2. warm smoking (25 â€“ 50 oC) for several days;
3. cold smoking (12 -25 oC) for up to several weeks.

## Storing it "on the hoof"

Ideally, animal is slaughtered as they are needed, and all their meat is
consumed.

Don't raise meat animals that provide so much meat that you have to
store it. Chickens would fit the bill, since you can process a single
chicken, prepare a meal with the mean, make soup (possibly canning it)
from the leftovers, and not have to worry so much about preserving the
meat. Or make arrangements so that a larger animal (e.g. in the case
where you're keeping dairy animals like goats or cattle)
[can be shared among enough people](/mutual-aid) so that the meat is used immediately.
