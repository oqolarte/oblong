Thought about reincarnations lately. Common motif includes
butterflies making random visits in garden. They are beautiful indeed, so no
wonder people imagine them as one of the possible next-life vessels.

But if the next life is possible, I wish to be reincarnated as something
more social---bees, ants, or even termites. If borders and hierarchies
had not been abolished yet in this lifetime, maybe as bugs in the next
would be more successful.
