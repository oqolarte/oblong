How else do you spend an afternoon other than answering [questions from the internet](https://flyeronthewall.wordpress.com/about/about-yourself/)?
Not all questions from that questionnaire made here. 
I picked the ones that I may have an interesting answer to.

1. **Do you take flyers when people in public places offer them in your direction? 
If yes, what do you do with them afterwards?**  
Only when they shove it to me, in which case I dispose the flyer immediately.

1. **What is your first memory of using the Internet?**  
A grade-school classmate invited me to check out some online games in Cartoon Network's website.
The game involved the then-popular Teen Titans.
I was amazed at how easy it was to "access the internet."

1. **What is the last thing you think you failed at?**  
I failed to consider the difficulty of getting into hobby electronics.
Having said that, I'm still unsuccessful in repairing a broken Apple Magsafe 1.

1. **Isn't there something else you should be doing right now?**  
I think it's called "looking for a job" but today is Saturday.
The headhunters are resting.

1. **If this questionnaire were to have a title, what should it be?**  
Qualitative Research---but only because I find it to be an ironic reflection of this task.

1. **What was the last thing you read that ruined you?**  
*Never Let Me Go* by Kazuo Ishiguro.
It ruined me in both good and bad way.
One of my favorite dystopians that, in my opinion, not only is chilling but is also depressing.
I also watched the movie, which is a good adaptation, in my opinion, of the novel.

1. **Who or what comes into your mind when you hear the name Agnes?**  
"Agnes" could be a motherly character from a prime time telenovela played by Agot Isidro.
