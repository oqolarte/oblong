Democracy is the rule of majority. It is still a form of hierarchy, in
which the desires of majority trample those of the minority.

Democracy is therefore rigged to appease the majority and
[make the process profitable](/capitalism) to keep the status quo.

What, you think it benefits everyone?

At least within the so-called Philippines, its implementation is a sham.
It is impossible for anyone to legislate for everyone else. All of us
have our own unique experiences, our own life stories that cannot be
considered by lawmakers, no matter their claims of wanting to represent
us.
