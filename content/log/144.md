- Minor edit in [About](/about) page.

Most days at home are spent slacking, slouching,
and generally sliding in and out consciousness.
Lately, the grey's runtime at zenith has exposed me to unfavorable
weather conditions when I'm out and about.
This might also explain the surge of number of people coughing and sniffing.
Flu season is in the air,
in time for Halloween,
which coincidentally, also is tangential to celebrating death.

I could say that the weather also explains my experiencing of lethargy,
and that would be the end of it.
I could also "sleep the evil" out of me,
but really, sleep cannot exorcise the tangled spirits within.

## Brief Review of *Crying in H Mart*

I like this memoir of Michelle Zauner (Japanese Breakfast),
who not only is a fellow Aries but
also shares the same birthday as mine!
That's it. That's the review.

Kidding aside, I find the prose easy enough to read but not bland,
purple enough to hear the author's distinct voice and feel what they
had felt through the joy and suffering.

## Bike Messenger

A friend recently told us that they will be going to Europe for a new
opportunity there, and we naturally felt happy for them.

I have actually been thinking that if I ever got lucky enough to get
into Europe or, gods forbid, North America,
I'd be a bike messenger.
Top of mind, it's the only blue collar job that I can think of
that I *might* enjoy.
Coming from the Global South, I'd expect that jobs,
especially non-tech ones, for PoCs like me
aren't going to be easy to snag.
So maybe, I'd have better chances as a bike messenger.

The problem is, I have a poor sense of direction.
I can easily get lost in new places.
But that can be ammended by technology through the use of GPS, right?
