Security hardening is the process of strengthening a system to reduce
its vulnerability and attack surface. All the potential vulnerabilities
that a [threat actor](/threat-actor) could exploit are referred to as a system's attack
surface.

Security hardening can be conducted on any device or system that can be
compromised like:
- hardware
- operating systems
- applications
- computer networks
- databases

Physical security is also a part of security
hardening. This may include securing a physical space with security
cameras and security guards.

## Common ways to harden security

- software updates (AKA patches)
- device application configuration changes.
- keeping [encryption](/cryptographyy) up to date makes it harder for
  malicious actors to access the database.
- removing or disabling unused applications and services
- disabling unused ports
- reducing access permissions across devices and network
- conduct regular penetration testing

## Penetration testing

A [penetration test](/pen-test), also called a pen test, is a simulated
attack that helps identify vulnerabilities in a system,
[network](/network), website, application, and process. Penetration
testers document their findings in a report. Depending on where the test
fails, security teams can determine the type of security vulnerabilities
that require fixing.
