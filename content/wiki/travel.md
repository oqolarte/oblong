We know there is much to see and experience with all our senses. After
all, life is an exploration of forces of the world, not conformity to
a/*the* fixed ideal. The places with interesting things are usually not
Here. Sometimes, they are not even in the Now.

## Something new

This search for novelty and escape from the
[mundane activities of daily life](/simple-living) compel people to travel to
(relatively) distant places.

Traveling nowadays comes with a cost: financial, social, environmental.
If I want to go somewhere, I need to plan how my [in]actions might
affect the destination.

Fernando Pessoa writes in one of his entries in *The Book of Disquiet*:

> Travel is for those who cannot feel. That's why travel books are
> always so unsatisfying as books of experience.

A bold claim!

Pessoa explores why we do need to travel when there are infinite worlds
within us. I would agree, if it weren't for the fact that not all people
can have healthy imaginations with which to construct virtual places to
visit. Some have destructive internal machinations that introspection
leads them to darker, more harmful places.

## Appeal

I understand the appeal of traveling. Meeting new people; being exposed
to different cultures that may be diametrically opposed to the one you
have; learning about food; seeing new places; etc---all of these are
valid ways of making sense of the people and the world around you.

But also, how does one travel frugally? Not just in the sense of having
a budget and sticking to it, although that is a non-trivial part of it,
but also are there even ways to go to distant lands that does not have
to be environmentally harmful?

For example, how plausible is it to travel *frugally*:
- alone, as a person of color (PoC)?
- as a PoC trans-person?
- with kids?
- with a senior but healthy dog?
- as person with disability?

As we imagine more accessible and inclusive ways of [getting from point A to B](/transpo)
