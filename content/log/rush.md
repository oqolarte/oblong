If I were to advocate for free flow of information, I must let others, including commercial institutions, be able to riff off of my work. 
I only ask that they include my name in the footnotes.
- Added some new sections to [This Site]({{< ref "project/site.md" >}})
- Removed the blurb on the landing page that said "I have no other social media accounts..."
That's not really accurate.
What I don't have are Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, and Instagram.
- Fixed "Last Update" logic in [Projects]({{< ref "project/" >}}).

We all learn that it takes a whole lot of time to get to know oneself.
A year's worth of quasi-isolation seems to be enough.

A flare of imagination could trigger emotions never felt before, and to that person, this is their first time learning this thing about himself.
It could be wild, sometimes--detrimental, even--to not have the full scope of one's being at one's disposal for one's perusal.
That's also one of the main reasons why I started this blog: another attempt to understand myself.

We can't really just say to ourselves, "Be patient," because the systems laid out in front of us are designed to burn us out.
Besides, it's hard for me to remain patient when I'm constantly facing external pressures to Do Something Productive.
