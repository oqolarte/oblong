- Changed this site's title, from *__of somersaulting__* to *__to oblique lair__*.
The latter is an anagram of my middle and surname.
It also emits a certain mystery that kind of misleads.
Look up "anagram maker" on your favorite search engine if you're into that kind of fun.
- Added some new recommendations in the [Encoding]({{< ref "/project/encode.md" >}}) project
- Edited some lines and addded footnotes in [This Site]({{< ref "/project/site.md" >}}) project
- New CSS for `<code>` blocks using [Hugo's built-in syntax highlighting](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/).
Currently, I am using the `monokai` theme.
- Added new section in [Always Carry A Book Website]({{< ref "/project/alwayscarry.md" >}}) project that briefly explains about a newly added search function feature.
