Money doesn't make one happy;
but it's something we use to function
in a society where it's highly valued.

I don't aim to be rich, which is tricky: how rich is rich?
Wealth does shape interactions within society:
those that have too much of it reshape the systems to let them have more of it.

For me, I want to have enough to not worry about basic necessities,
but not so much that I become a billionaire.

If at all possible,
I want to [retire early](/simple-living).

## Strategies to use

- Avoid credit card debt.
Maybe avoid credit card altogether.
If you can't afford it in a single payment using cash (or debit),
you can't afford it.
Hard mode: If you can't afford it double it's amount in a single payment using
cash (or debit),
you can't afford it.
- [Learn as much as you can from the world and the people](/being-critical).
But don't turn into a know-it-all.
- There's a difference between cheap and affordability:
the former implies low quality,
the latter implies high, longer lasting quality.
- Managing time wisely has the potential to improve one's life.
The days are long,
but the years are short.
So, don't waste time.
- You cannot reach your goals alone.
[Take care and help yourself](/health),
but when you have the capacity,
extend your care to others as well.
[We can keep each other safe and secure.](/mutual-aid)
- Take calculated risks,
but don't be afraid to lose something in the process.

## Achieving Financial Independence?

Achieving financial independence, likely a fad into which I
freefall, is difficult especially if it's in
conflict with some parts of my current internal compass.

Still, there are ways to do this: by needing money, and by not needing
money at all.

By needing money, I meant that by having enough money, assets, and/or
investments to live off of for the rest of your life without having to
worry about needing to enter the workforce for salary. In the parameters
established in the capitalistic design of society, this is doable,
albeit very hard.

By not needing money, I meant living off of food that one grows in their
garden, and/or exchanging goods and services not for money, but for
other goods and services that one might need.

Why financial independence, then?

1. I [dislike the idea of work](/anti-work). I can't force myself to
   excel in most careers knowing I am replacing my life hours with
   corporate hours so I could have money for basic needs.
2. I want to do the things that I want with the time I still have. I need the time and space between these [passion projects](/di-why) so I
   don't feel like i'm pressured or rushed to do something.
3. I want to spend my time with [people I love](/friendship).
4. I'd like to explore as many places as i can with the people I love.
   While solo travel is a promising act, doing it with someone
   multiplies the joy (or divides the despair).

## Financial Big Wins

Frugality in small ways does help, but we need to also look for
opportunities that have bigger ROIs. An example: for the salaryperson,
negotiating for a raise, and/or job-hopping.
