I believe in the importance of having [skin in the game](/skin-in-the-game),
which is more or less the Golden Rule with
some minor tweaks. If I were to explain it based on my understanding, it
would be thus: For one's critique on a field/domain to have some
weight, one must have stakes in it.

For example, when I complain about the quality of life living in Global
South; or when I stress over the volatility of current finances---know
that each of these has merits, because it is my daily reality since
birth.

So: I am merely an enjoyer of art of many forms, done by different
artists all over the world. If any of my writing can be considered an
art form, then that is my stake if I were to critique art in general...
right?

That is all preamble, though, just to say that I am not a fan of Juan
Luna's works, not even the guy himself! Luna, as far as I know,[^lunart] mostly
painted European-looking subjects, and for some reason, that irks me.
His art is objectively good: realistic, good lighting, evocative scenes;
but also the artworks themselves does not exist in a vacuum.

Should we subtract points from the art just because the artist who
created it:
- [murdered his wife out of jealousy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Luna#Marriage)?
- rarely painted Filipinos and the Philippines?

Or should we experience the body of work as an entity unto itself?

[^lunart]: Art historians, please correct me on this!

We see this all the time in other fields as well: music, literature.
When artists fall into a scandal, some fans will readily cancel them;
some fans will excuse them. And some neutral ones will find ways to enjoy their
existing work while at the same time no longer supporting the artist.
