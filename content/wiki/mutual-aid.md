**TL;DR**: It's like a pot luck.
Bring what you can,
take what you need.

Mutual aid is a situation where you have two or more parties who are on equal footing,
equal power and social standing and worth,
giving each other things that they need for mutual benefit and support.
It isn't an exchange, however, because it doesn't take place in one sitting, and isn't calculated.

For example, I could help you out with something you need help with,
and my only expectation would be that you, or a friend of yours,
help me out with something I need, some amount of time down the road
(the next time I need help with something).
It doesn't matter what the two things are
(so we don't compare monetary values or labor time or anything)
or how far apart they take place---I could help fix your computer
and you could cook me chicken soup while I'm sick;
or I could [get you enough food](/feeding) to last the week,
and you could let me crash at your place between rentals---as long as
the chain of reciprocity continues.
The only time I'd stop is if I did something for you and you never did anything remotely worth it for me in return
(and that's a flexible limit, too, it doesn't have to be one for one),
which is why you're motivated to reciprocate if you want to keep this mutually beneficial relationship going with me.

Basically, it's a flexible way for resources to flow through social networks to the places where they are needed from who can spare them.
It's a way of satisfying the
"from each according to their ability, to each according to their need"
maxim of communism without having a central planner
or forcing anyone to do anything---because
giving according to your ability motivates others to give to you according to what you need
because if you don't ever get anything in return then they're just freeloading on you and you don't have to keep giving aid to them.

On the other hand, charity---and many of its recent forms
including [effective altruism](/ea) and longtermism---has a clear power imbalance:
one side, as the "superior" side in wealth and social standing,
gives things out of pity to the other side.
It's psychologically harmful to those on the receiving end,
and also makes them dependent on the caprice of the emotions
of those who give,
instead of having anything to give in return
so as to motivate them to give.
And for those on the giving end,
it's more of a virtue signal or a way to assuage one's conscience than anything that's really sustainable from a societal perspective.
