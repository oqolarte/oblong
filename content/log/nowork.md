Does it improve the readability of the site?

I'd like to talk briefly about my current employment situation, which would end soon:
I would be officially out of work by this 12 Feb, and I think that's fine.
An official excuse to be lethargic for a while.

Nothing is lined up at the momment.
The search goes on.

It's just that employers make sure that they do as much filtering as possible.
Some would inappropriately ask, "What self-improvement did you do during the lockdown?"
What they're really asking is, "We are looking for people with the initiative to make themselves useful for profit-making. Are you one of them?"

People need to slow down.
Don't give in to the hustle culture, which is inherently toxic by nature anyway.
