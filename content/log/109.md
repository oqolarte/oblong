It has been a little over a year now since I started taking yoga seriously.
By which I mean doing it regularly when time and willpower permits.
S convinced me to try it,
and while I was not instantly hooked,
I soon got why it can benefit me.

My practice of yoga amounts to several times a week, but not daily, at least not yet.
On average, three times a week.
Some weeks I can do it daily;
some weeks I can only do it on one day.

So, what has changed?

The truth is, I have not enough data for a meaningful answer.
I only log the duration of each session, in minutes.
With that as my only piece of recorded information,
I haven't yet devised a formula to extract an insight from that data set alone.

Anecdotally, I feel slightly more stoic.
Although it feels off using that word---*stoic*---as I don't think it necessarily fits what I really feel.

I still experience flare-ups and outbursts,
something I've been trying to manage ever since I was a kid.
If yoga can---and I think it does---help my mental wellbeing,
it will take a lot more than just a year of regular practice.
