This year, we have cold January mornings again. Too, we have that lull
at dawn when all is peaceful. Sleep gestures.
But it doesn't last for long. Cars and
motors come to existence in gradual crescendo on the adjacent busy
street, busing people to places. I hear the occasional bell of a
cyclist, and I imagine them weaving between cars. And if the cyclist
were your typical commuter, *he* would be on a beater bike, politely
shredding his way to work whilst death-evading impatient big machines on
four wheels. This is the morning din I don't like. Where are the birds?
Have they been fully displaced?

I open my eyes and get up. There, on the floor! A bird. Supposedly a
"gift," it will always be lifeless now, no thanks to one of our cats'
knack for hunting.

Speaking of mornings, one workmate complained that their mornings as of
late have always been "hot." They didn't elaborate on it, but it made me
wonder. I suspect that it could be because they're surrounded with
concrete, which absorbs and traps warmth from the sun. And everywhere we
look, concrete makes up a lot of our buildings, sidewalks, and parking
lots which prevents heat from being released into the cold night sky.
