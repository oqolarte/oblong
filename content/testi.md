Peak [Friendster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendster) days had
people displaying their testimonials ("testi"). Acquiring them was
serious business. In the spirit of *testi*, and being the nostal-junkie
that I am, the following are written affirmations from different people
I have interacted with in some capacity. Many, if not all, are edited
for clarity and/or anonymized for privacy.

## *Testi*s

> "Well-rounded as [project manager]. Can handle a team effectively.
> Very supportive to his teammates."

> "[...] You do so well to keep across all stakeholders [...] and help
> everything to run as smoothly as possible. I'm very appreciative of
> your hard work and effort on our accounts and think you do a brilliant
> job of keeping on top of all the moving parts [...]"

> "I look up to a lot of what you do ha!"

> "Ohio is patient and works well under pressure. [He also] seems to be
> well organized and have a good understanding of the projects he works
