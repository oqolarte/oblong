My friends and I talked about our creative endeavors, and how work-life
balance, or lack thereof, impacts our individual pursuits.
As someone who *sometimes*
write creatively as a hobby,
I said, "I only write what I like to write." One of my
friends rightfully, and almost painfully, reminded me that Work also
requires me "to write." So, there's also that.

## Writing Humor

I sometimes think of writing a whole stand-up comedy routine, but I know
that stuff's hard to produce. My current level is coming up with the best
puns on the spot, but if I'm being honest with myself, they are a
mix of hits and misses. To construct a whole narrative that constantly
delivers a funny punchline - that's hard. For me to do that,
I imagine having someone to
banter with on stage, *Ã  la* *Whose Line Is It Anyway?* improv stuff.
And to be honest, I may not have the right stage presence.
Yet.

Still, it would be a nice side project that I could maybe perform for
families and friends, if they're willing to sit through the whole
ordeal.

## Writing for Fun

> I only write what I like to write.

Even that's hard. Updating this log doesn't even get the consistency
I want. The plan was to post a weekly update. But time flies,
and life around me gels into and out of Being,
whether I know it or not. Writing consistently *is* a challenge, given
all the busyness of a modern salaried worker like myself.

And to write about anything,
don't we have to consume many things?
Reading, watching, listening, observing the world around us...

Maybe I should start writing reviews (weekly?) of all things that come
my way and/or of things I have interacted with: places I've visited,
food I've eaten, media I've seen/watched/listened to.

In fact, I'll start now.

## REVIEW: Bike lane in EDSA northbound

This is a short review of the bike lane in EDSA Northbound, specifically
from East Ave going to North Ave.

It's trash, bordering dangerous. Motorists barely respect the existence
of bike lane,
especially that the only divider is a painted line that, quite
literally, gradually fades.
Of course, traffic enforcers have never been of great help.
We often joke that they are the complete opposite of help,
as they enforce traffic, see?
Anyway, sometimes these uniformed people block the bike lanes
themselves, and/or enable unsafe conditions for cyclists,
such as allowing public buses to park over bike lanes.

I imagine that the bike lanes on the entire length of EDSA look and
feel the same---barely safe "but at least it's there."
