In the show [*Avatar: The Last Airbender*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417299/), Zuko, one of the
main characters, was taught Breath of Fire, a firebending technique that
would keep him warm in super cold environments, giving him the chance to
survive them.

My "breath of fire" is [muzak](/155), more specifically in
singing, even if I'm not really good at it. It has
metaphorically kept me warm through the cold, harsh realities of modern
life, as if the elders had held me in their blazing love.
