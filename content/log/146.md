The concept of time and entropy is still too complex for me to fully
understand. Yes, I have a general idea of what each of them mean, and
how I can sometimes use them to my advantage in my daily life. At the
end of the day, though, I'm only consistent at two things:

1. March another day towards oblivion (easy)
2. Update this blog weekly (nigh improbable)

*Mamamatay ka rin*, so says the adage.
It's crystal clear to me to not mind the things out of my reach.

## On Data Collection

I'm in an odd position where I'm able to collect many kinds
of data relatively easily, whether for personal or work use.
And I've been thinking how many of this effort is for "just-in-case"?

If all the data I collect is overwhelming me such that I'm left
paralyzed, then what use are they?

One strategy I do is
I try to be mindful of the information I curate into my offline wiki.

When we scale up beyond the personal, we have big tech companies mining our data
without our knowledge. Deceptive design patterns on the tools---both hard-
and software---we use keep our focus away from the what matters most
when interfacing with these companies' products and services: our
informed consent.

## Brief review of *Hamilton* Musical

I'm lucky to have watched the musical recently. Now that I've
experienced it myself, I get its appeal. Overall, I'd say it's a good
watch.

*Hamilton* has its ups and downs, no doubt.
While I'm starting to appreciate the effort of all people on and
offstage producing these kinds of musicals,
I may not be there yet fully, if that makes sense.
My eyes and ears were most of the time
overwhelmed with the sounds and colors and motions.
Someone tell me if the point is to not focus on one thing,
but to just let it all take you along.

The songs are good and catchy, many of them rapped.
My favorite one is "Satisfied".

If I had to nitpick, my main gripe is in the content itself:
the biography of Alexander Hamilton. Not a fan.
Of America's history, of learning more about its founding fathers.
One character I like, though, is Lafayette.
But to *Hamilton*'s credit, it was all presented to me
in a very entertaining way, enough to keep me engaged whether I like the
content or not.
Like watching a forest fire, maybe.

## On being cool

Cool people don't go around telling people that they're cool.
They just are. People around them notice that and make that inference
for themselves, and agree "This person is cool."

Anti-cool people (probably me) *do* tell people that they're anti-cool.
And that's that.

## On being alone in the house

Today, my lonesome bothers me little,
only so far as to who will take out the trash.
The answer to that *does* surprise---me.

Days ago, home was entangled with familial ties.
Now, I'm the only human left to look after our furry friends.

On the other hand, I can't say I miss it,
but solitude forces me to be more creative at keeping myself
and the spaces around me lively enough.

Days bleed into the next one.
Tracking time means I know that soon I won't be alone.
