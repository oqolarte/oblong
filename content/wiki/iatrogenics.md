Iatrogenics is when a treatment causes
[more harm than benefit](/second-order-thinking).

Before intervening in a situation---be
it in personal [health](/health), [finance](/personal-finance),
[technology](/technology), etc.---it's
best to know as much as possible.
This includes predicting what the outcomes of our actions and inactions,
whether each would indeed be helpful or not.

A good question to ask: "And then what?"

We should only intervene when the benefits outweigh the negatives.

What should we control? We could look into limiting the following to
approach a more [antifragile](/antifragile) system:
- size
- concentration
- speed

Iatrogenics can also be identified in other fields, like [AI](/ai).
In Joan Westenberg's
[post *"Creators don't need your rage. They need your support."*](https://www.joanwestenberg.com/creators-dont-need-your-rage-they-need-your-support), they argue that "[a]ttempting to battle AI content" in public spaces, especially in social media sites, only broadens it's reach.

Many people are still averse to hospitals and other similar healthcare
facilities, largely because the have been seedbeds of death. That, or it
is very expensive for most of us to really afford without plummeting to
destitution.

Author Nassim Nicholas Taleb argues that [capitalism](/capitalism) is
working in an inverse-iatrogenics. In dismantling or obsoleting it,
then, we would would have to prioritize both self- and community care:
helping one empowers the other, creating a positive feedback loop.
