A **penetration test**, or pen test, is a simulated attack that helps
identify vulnerabilities in systems, [networks](/network), websites,
applications, and processes. The simulated attack in a pen test involves
using the same tools and techniques as malicious actors in order to
mimic a real life attack. Since a pen test is an authorized attack, it
is considered to be a form of ethical hacking.
Unlike a [vulnerability assessment](/vulnerability-assessment)
that finds weaknesses in a
system's [security](/security), a pen test exploits those weaknesses to
determine the potential consequences if the system breaks or gets broken
into by a threat actor.

**Note**: Organizations that are regulated by PCI DSS, HIPAA, or GDPR must routinely perform penetration testing to maintain compliance standards.

## Learning from varied perspectives

These authorized attacks are performed by pen testers who are skilled in
programming and network architecture. Depending on their objectives,
organizations might use a few different approaches to penetration
testing:

- Red team tests *simulate attacks* to identify vulnerabilities in
  systems, networks, or applications.
- Blue team tests focus on *defense and incident* response to validate
  an organization's existing security systems.
- Purple team tests are *collaborative*, focusing on improving the
  security posture of the organization by combining elements of red and
  blue team exercises.

Penetration testers must make an important decision before simulating an
attack: *How much access and information do I need?*

## Penetration testing strategies

1. Open-box testing is when the tester has the same privileged access
   that an internal developer would have---information like system
   architecture, data flow, and network diagrams. This strategy goes by
   several different names, including internal, full knowledge,
   white-box, and clear-box penetration testing.
1. Closed-box testing is when the tester has little to no access to
   internal systems---similar to a malicious hacker. This strategy is
   sometimes referred to as external, black-box, or zero knowledge
   penetration testing. Closed box testers tend to produce the most
   accurate simulations of a real-world attack.
1. Partial knowledge testing is when the tester has limited access and
   knowledge of an internal system---for example, a customer service
   representative. This strategy is also known as gray-box testing.

## Becoming a penetration tester

Penetration testers are in-demand in the fast growing field of [cybersecurity](/cybersecurity). Skills that will help in pen testing:

- [Network and application security](/network-security)
- Experience with operating systems, like Linux
- [Vulnerability analysis](/vulnerability-management) & threat modeling
- Detection and response tools
- [Programming languages](/programming), like Python and BASH
- [Communication skills](/communication)

## Bug bounty programs

Organizations commonly run bug bounty programs which offer freelance pen
testers financial rewards for finding and reporting vulnerabilities in
their products. Bug bounties are great opportunities for amateur
security professionals to participate and grow their skills.

Pro tip: [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/bug-bounty-programs) is a
community of ethical hackers where you can find active bug bounties to
participate in.
