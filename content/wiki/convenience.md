## Intro

Submitting to the promise of convenience poses risk not only to our
[health](/health), but to the health of other lives on which we rely to
live.

Because our lives are becoming more convenient, we risk losing the
physical, mental, and social ability to look after ourselves and those
around us.

## On agriculture

Any constraint in harvesting should be considered and respected,
especially if such friction actually maintains
[ecological balance](/social-ecology).
This means we should reconsider using big
tractors and maybe opt for lower-tech ones that need no heavy machinery,
even if latter is "slower" and "less efficient".

Slowness and "inefficiency" in farming was one of the things that the
First Settlers of Turtle Island did not understand of the Native
Peoples. The Native Peoples (not only in Turtle Island, but also
everywhere else) have had a way of maintaining an abundant
and sustainable relationship with the land, so much so that the
foreigners thought of the "savages" as being lazy for not harvesting
everything in one go.

[The wisdom is in leaving something for the others as well](/honorable-harvest). For example,
wild birds and other animals would eat whatever is left for their
sustenance, and their droppings would fertilize the earth, preparing it
for the next planting season.
