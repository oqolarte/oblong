Yo, if you're a cis-hetero man over the age of 60, why do you have to
make everything about you?

I mean, if I squint hard enough, I could see the details of your
troubled past, the struggles your people had had to go through to
survive. I could piece together some clues, but who wants to go
through all that when a better alternative, taking in the form of
cutting ties, is within arm's reach?

To you, I say: we all need to be responsible with how we express our
courage while keeping in mind not to glorify sacrifice. Doing the latter
is a macho thing, i.e., thing of the past.

# Music

For the month of Feb 2024, these are the albums I listened to.

| Album Name                | Artist           |
|---------------------------|------------------|
| The System Works for Them | Aus Rotten       |
| Spiritual Paralysis       | Hexsystem        |
| Forest Floor              | Fergus McCreadie |
| Jazz                      | Queen            |
| Capricorn/Gen-X Corps     | Vampire Weekend  |
| Sleep                     | Ruru             |

All good albums so far, and it's hard to pick a favorite for this month:
Aus Rotten always got me agitated in a good way; *Spiritual Paralysis*
doesn't demand too much of your focus but when you make the effort, you
will be rewarded with dream-like sequences that soothes the tired
corpo brain; the whole *Jazz* is shamelessly glamorous.
