This week was about examining the things we take for granted, including
comfort and digital communication.

## What is a comfortable life?

I was invited to a dinner recently for which I am grateful (free food!).
However, dinner with this specific group of people left a bad taste in
the mouth.

One person in this group reminded me of [hedonic treadmill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill), even
half-joked that their kid "gave [them] anxiety" for believing they are
rich. They are, but this person felt otherwise, despite having their own
house, at least one car that I know of, at least one family business
that I know of, and a stable job with a relatively sizeable income
because of tenure.

Their current comfortable life, an ideal status for many people, is just
a baseline for them. And hearing about it felt out of sync of reality.

## PH State wants to ban Signal and Telegram

This article "[Privacy leaves the chat: CICC proposal to block Signal raises red flags](https://www.abs-cbn.com/news/technology/2026/2/15/privacy-leaves-the-chat-cicc-proposal-to-block-signal-raises-red-flags-2230)"
reported how the Cybercrime Investigation and Coordinating Center (CICC)
thinks about blocking Signal messaging app, citing concerns about "users
pretending to be ... high-ranking government officials."

Another article reported "[DICT considers ban on Telegram](https://technology.inquirer.net/144986/dict-considers-ban-on-telegram),"
citing that the app hosts illegal content, including different forms of
online gambling and sexual abuse. In a recent update (same article),
DICT and Telegram came to an agreement in essentially regulating the app
more, whatever that means.

As of writing, I have yet to find a report on whether Signal has had
talks with the Philippine government in addressing said concerns, so
that leaves Signal on the table.

Rather than addressing the systemic social issues at the roots, the
statist solution is to just [try to] blanket ban messaging apps,
thinking technical solutions solves social problems. They do not.

Why not ban Facebook altogether when by sheer volume, the platform hosts
more scams than Signal? In reality, it is more about maintaining control
than protecting citizens from harm. With Signal being end-to-end
encrypted, surveillance is much harder for states to accomplish.

## Random thoughts

- I'm trying to get better at carpentry, but now that I'm busy and
  exhausted from work, I don't think it woodwork.
- Chatbots spit out regurgitated factoids that may or may not be concise
  enough for impatient users. This is *also* where we are at [AI](/ai).

## Music

For the month of FEB 2025, the only album I listened to was the
self-titled album of **The Specials**.
