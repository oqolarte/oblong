A close family recommended *Agitations tropicales*, the second track in
this EP by L'ImpÃ©ratrice. And she was right---I do like it. That's why I
decided to listen to the whole EP.

While the whole thing requires more than one pass to appreciate it, the
time it takes for that to happen under this constellation of French disco
pops is significantly less than the time it takes to make a round trip
to the moon.

**Rating**: 3 ðŸŒ• out of 5
