Can I give myself a nickname? Doing that always felt weird, especially
that part where I should tell people about it. But we've been doing
that, in some form, when we think about our usernames in online spaces.

And yet, the meatspace varies wildly from the nethwerweb, obviously;
the culture in one doesn't necessarily translate [well] into the other.

## 2024

Anyway, it's almost the "end of the year" 2024. But time simply rolls on
to the next, almost seamless if it weren't for the loud cracks of
fireworks.

In many Asian cultures, fireworks are believed to ward the bad spirits
away. Wouldn't it be funny when these fireworks disappeared the very
person that lit it, because that person is bad?

On a more serious yet still in the realm of superstition: I hope the
fireworks instead dispel the idea of hierarchies, and the institutions
with which such hierarchies are made crumble and be no more.
