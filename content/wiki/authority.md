Authority has the ambition to shape the circles of their constituency
but, more often than not, lack the ability to do so. Without resorting
to coercion, fear, abuse of power, charm, seduction, horseplay, and
other malignant acts of human's creative mind, authority can only do so
much to make people follow the rules---rules written by the priveleged.

Many mean well; many more are found insensate, as if playing with
people's lives, if it weren't for the ignorance. If they do play with
people's lives, their intent has been sinister from the get-go, not good
governance.

If the rules are not inclusive, or if they serve to divide people, then
the authorities who wrote them function only in cognitive dissonance in
which people have to have hierarchies.
