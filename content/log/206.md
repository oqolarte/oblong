- Updated [FOSS](/foss) list.

The recent visit to [BLTX Aug 2024](https://www.instagram.com/xeroxography/) (Instagram link) has
reshuffled my life's priorities, one of the effects being eyeing
at online listings for
second-hand typewriters.

"It's okay," I kid myself. We don't have much time left anyways,
and for all we know, [we're already spinning out of control](/collapse).

I dare not daydream further. Analysis paralysis has stonegazed me while
the remaining Reason continuously Heimlich-maneuvers me so I don't lose
being Here Now.

In the near future, I can see myself making zines, both to pass time and
to self-administer a pseudo-therapy for myself wanting to do something
with these two hands other press keys on a keyboard for some 40 hours in
a work week.
