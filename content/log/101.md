- Renamed all the log filenames to increasing positive integers,
starting from 1.
This log would be the 101st.
I realize that this would break some internal links.
I've tried to rectify that,
but if you see any broken link that's supposed to be linked to a log,
please let me know.
- Added 10 new entries to [Imbentori](/imbentori).
- Updated some lines in [Knowing Here](/here).

## More thoughts on LinkedIn

This short section is an addendum to the [previous post on the same
subject](/54).

When can I permanently log out of LinkedIn?
It's one of those social media sites that I begrudgingly hold on to,
because it was literally my proof of existence when the Immigration
did a background check on me [last time we went to Taiwan](https://seekers.araw.xyz/taiwan-part1/).

I actually know the answer:
when I no longer need to work.

## Visiting Pagkakaisa, 2022

Lola Mila's grand party in Carmona Court had to be postponed,
not only because there's still a COVID pandemic going on,
nor is it because of the growring concern over monkeypox.
No, it's because Lola caught,
for the fourth time,
amoebiasis,
which is said to be common among the elders.
People advised her to rest it out,
and she couldn't agree more.

Her celebration had to be simplified,
albeit done more, that is, folks celebrated her birthday over
three different days.

I went on the third day, a Sunday,
a perfect day for cycling,
when motorists with ill intent are not on the road.

We had a small gathering,
consisting of three chainsmokers,
one of whom is the celebrant herself.
It can be a dizzying experience for an ex-smoker like me,
but isn't life a long list of compromises?

My round trip totaled ~22 kilometers,
a good exercise riding fixed.
