Iatrogenics is when a treatment causes
[more harm than benefit](/second-order-thinking).

Before intervening in a situation---be
it in personal [health](/health), [finance](/personal-finance), [technology](/technology), etc.---it's
best to know as much as possible.
This includes predicting what the outcomes of our actions and inactions,
whether each would indeed be helpful or not.

A good question to ask: "And then what?"

We should only intervene when the benefits outweigh the negatives.

Iatrogenics can also be identified in other fields, like [AI](/ai).
In Joan Westenberg's
[post *"Creators don't need your rage. They need your support."*](https://www.joanwestenberg.com/creators-dont-need-your-rage-they-need-your-support), they argue that "[a]ttempting to battle AI content" in public spaces, especially in social media sites, only broadens it's reach.
