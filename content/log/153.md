Metro Manila Film Festival is, once again, releasing good films.

*Mallari* (2023) is a horror-thriller headlined by Piolo Pascual.
It is about three generation of Mallaris linked together by generational
"darkness" (is how I would put it).

In my opinion, the film could have been better if the jump scares were
reduced to a max of one. In fact, every horror and horror-adjacent movie
should only be allowed a budget of one jump scare, non-transferable.
When overused, jump scare cheapens the thrill. It scars the oeuvre
rather than augment it. It leaps because it is impatient to creep into
the delivery.

Some of the themes used in the film remind me of Edgar Allan
Poe's *The Tell-Tale Heart*. At least two of the main characters turn
out to be unreliable with their points of views as each of them justify
their descent to madness. If a force greater than us compels us to act
on things not grounded on reality, is this a curse?

A bane of human fallibility is to throw away our principles and beliefs
for more selfish reasons disguised as an act of Love. We go out
committing infinities through all dimensions for our soulmates, but how
sure are we that it is Love that we offer and not a rotten form of
it? We can't know for sure until it's too late.
