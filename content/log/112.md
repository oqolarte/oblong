The past few weeks since my last log,
a lot has already happened.
But it's hard to talk about them in public.
It could be that I'm always stuck in loops in my head.
When I try to recall them,
the details are hazy,
like it's just a series of big circles linked together,
where the links are even hazier,
but can be detected if you squint hard enough.
The circles, though, seem to have no past;
each just an inifinite present opening and closing in on itself,
until it tangents to another adjacent circle.

## Out of my depth

One day, right after I woke up, a thought surprised me:
in the event that the car I'm in would plunge
into a body of water for whatever reason,
do I just accept my death,
knowing I can't swim?
What a way to die---to drown in both water and thalassophobia
at the same time, gradually and, I imagine, painfully.

From a distance, I admire mammals like cetaceans.
Deep water is their grace I hope to be in one day.
This world---this body---is mostly water.
Why then can't I reconcile the two?

## Telling my story

A few days later, I had another thought, although less pressing:
if I want to preserve my privacy,
whom do I tell my story if I'm no longer capable of doing it myself?
Do I even want my story to be told?

My journals and blogs (past, present, future)
are the closest manifestations of my autobiography,
and I'm glad I'm still writing in them consistently.

I select what is and isn't worth sharing,
and the rest---well, you just have to be there in the flesh
with me to experience the teeter between dullness and excitement,
to witness me strive in and out of the mundane.
And to also fact-check me,
because I'm not always the reliable, capable narrator of my own life.
