I talked about my [breath of fire](/178) which is, in short, my knack
for singing. By no means am I a good singer. But I grew up in a
household that prioritized music and singing, so that was instilled in
me early on. Weirdly enough, dancing was not part of the equation.

I remember when I was in elementary school, there was an audition for
chess players. Even though I only know how to play chess, I signed up.
It was mostly because I wanted to stay out of the boring classes that
day. The player who was partnered with me beat me in minutes, I would
say, but not without listening to my singing antics first. I wonder
whether he was annoyed at me.

I used to sing out loud in high school. It was not that I did not mind
other people---because I did, and the performance was for us all---but I
felt safe around my friends then. We would sing together our recent jams
and music finds, and in music we shared many good memories. I was even
the so-called drummer of a band my friends and I formed. I knew nothing
about drumming at all, but because I "like it so much I asked my father
to gift me one" must have been a compelling story that my friends
decided that I manned that station. Again, we all felt safe and knew how
to just have fun.

Then, college happened. And it replaced my then-friends with new people
from other walks of life, from other places that I had never been to. If
earlier years of being in an institutionalized worker mill called school
was not enough, then college was the fire that set dreams ablaze, in its
ashes, barely any music could be heard. I met people there who were
musically inclined, and I would say I got along with them well. Did we,
at one point, shared unknowingly the same wondering on what the hell
were we doing in engineering school? (Of course, we knew the answer to
that.)

The more I distance myself from [Unlimited Growth](/capitalism)'s death
knell, the quicker I regain the music. It is not a coincidence.
