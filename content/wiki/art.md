Remember, something as hard to define as art
is all about self-expression and creativity.
You don't always need fancy tools;
your [imagination](/surrealism) is your most valuable asset.

## Art begets art

Art has the power to reflect the complexities of the human
experience, to capture emotions, tell stories, and provoke thought.
It can serve as a mirror to society, highlighting issues, values, and
beliefs. But, art often doesn't provide clear (re)solutions to these issues.

Art can inspire change, raise awareness, and ignite conversations, but
it's usually up to individuals, communities, and societies to take
action and find resolutions to the challenges they face. Art can be a
catalyst for [change](/revolution),
but it's not a substitute for the practical steps
needed to address complex problems.

Being a snob, instead of actually making the effort to find ways to
enjoy and benefit from art, removes the joy in those pieces, all in the
name of a "refined" status. Be snob? BS!

### Art under Capitalism

However, art could never flourish under [capitalism](/capitalism).
In [a system that doesn't compel you to labor for basic needs](/anti-work),
everyone's artistic potential could be unlocked.

All humans are artists, but under capitalism we don't have the time to
cultivate our artistic senses. Moreover, while the myth of tortured
genius surely predates capitalism, it lingers in these modern times. I
wouldn't be shocked if many believers of capitalism might argue that
without the suffering it naturally causes, beautiful works might never
have come to life. What a twisted idea.

In Hazel Weakly's blog post *[The Trap of Soulless Productivity](https://hazelweakly.me/blog/soulless-productivity/)*, she puts it succinctly, "Fear and abuse and spreadsheet hacking doesn't help people be creative and share ideas[.]"

Greater art would come if most of us aren't so desparate to get by nor
meeting some impossible metric. To me, though, great art gets around
money---it just can't be bought. It can only be copied, transformed, or
transmuted to influence other creations, to start a movement maybe.

On that note, the greatest performance art, perhaps, is communities of
*artists* [coming together to help each other](/mutual-aid) out of this
cultural, systemic mess we find ourselves in.

## Why or How to Art?

I don't know exactly, except maybe it's a human thing to express oneself
in ways alleviate the daily struggles...?

Maybe, my art does not necessarily reside in th visual aspect, but more
on the acceptance of [chaos](/chaos) and impermanence, both of which are inherent
in this universe. I get my inspiration from each. I imagine some street
artists do the same. They have accepted these factors play into their
art. And yet, they will still go to great lengths to place their work
somewhere that the general public can see and experience.

## Art according Oscar Wilde

If ads are a perverted version of art,
then they are useless.
[Oscar Wilde](/oscar-wilde) had had some strong opinions about art being quite useless.
This appendix contains two of them.

### Preface to *The Picture of Dorian Gray*[^dg]

The artist is the creator of beautiful things. To reveal art and
conceal the artist is art’s aim. The critic is he who can translate
into another manner or a new material his impression of beautiful
things.

The highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of autobiography.
Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without
being charming. This is a fault.

Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the
cultivated. For these there is hope. They are the elect to whom
beautiful things mean only beauty.

There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well
written, or badly written. That is all.

The nineteenth century dislike of realism is the rage of Caliban seeing
his own face in a glass.

The nineteenth century dislike of romanticism is the rage of Caliban
not seeing his own face in a glass. The moral life of man forms part of
the subject-matter of the artist, but the morality of art consists in
the perfect use of an imperfect medium. No artist desires to prove
anything. Even things that are true can be proved. No artist has
ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable
mannerism of style. No artist is ever morbid. The artist can express
everything. Thought and language are to the artist instruments of an
art. Vice and virtue are to the artist materials for an art. From the
point of view of form, the type of all the arts is the art of the
musician. From the point of view of feeling, the actor’s craft is the
type. All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the
surface do so at their peril. Those who read the symbol do so at their
peril. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors.
Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new,
complex, and vital. When critics disagree, the artist is in accord with
himself. We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he
does not admire it. The only excuse for making a useless thing is that
one admires it intensely.

All art is quite useless.

### Wilde's Letter to Bernulf Clegg[^clegg]

> My dear Sir
> 
> Art is useless because its aim is simply to create a mood. It is not
> meant to instruct, or to influence action in any way. It is superbly
> sterile, and the note of its pleasure is sterility. If the contemplation
> of a work of art is followed by activity of any kind, the work is either
> of a very second-rate order, or the spectator has failed to realise the
> complete artistic impression.
> 
> A work of art is useless as a flower is useless. A flower blossoms for
> its own joy. We gain a moment of joy by looking at it. That is all that
> is to be said about our relations to flowers. Of course man may sell the
> flower, and so make it useful to him, but this has nothing to do with
> the flower. It is not part of its essence. It is accidental. It is a
> misuse. All this is I fear very obscure. But the subject is a long one.
