## Mulling on making

If ever make art, I would make it so that "elevated trash" as a
description of my work is actually a praise for it. It would mean I have
literally and figuratively taken trash off from their sure path to
landfill, and repurposed them to something else---at the very least, as
an icebreaker. It is possible; when I wrote about
[making useful things with hands](/270),
I made parallettes out of scrap wood. And I have been using those since.

Laura Kampf, a YouTuber and maker, has been producing a video series
called "[Janitor of LA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E92IVBzpyQ&list=PLLsyCFICnr80S4mLmq-D7bNkHZ9xu7wB7)"
in which they roam around the streets of Los Angeles, California
"looking for trash" and turn it into a "sculpture." I like how they use
the term sculpture as a fancy way for upcycled stuff, which is itself a
fancy way of saying elevated trash. This way, to me, "sculpture" implies
functionality as its main guiding aesthetic, but still exists under what
is considered aesthetically pleasing.

It would be cool to do something like this.

And what if I could utilize [Time](/apocalypse/#time) as another element
in, something to be considered and integrated into the "elevated trash"
art? Perhaps part or all of the piece grows (e.g., having moss bloom on
it), and/or gracefully decays (e.g., metal surfaces having patina) with
the passing of time. It is crazy but it adds another dementia.

## Today's BS

Job hunt is a numbers game. Submit applications, even with photos, so
many times that the proverbial "pass" is a consolation prize in this
brutal competition.
