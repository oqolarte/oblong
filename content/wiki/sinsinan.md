## Introduction

Nature is the first open source entity we encounter. Its generosity
extends to its ecosystems' participants. We humans used to
give and take in such; and in fact, some of us like the Indigenous Peoples
still do, taking part with the animals and plants in the ecological
mutual aid.

The empire of growth, conquest, and profit, though, rewards
destructive behaviors.

We clear forests for cities, only to leave many parts of it in
disrepair.

We dig large holes on the ground and displace communities to mine
metals for our electronics, only to not fully utilize them.

We take from Nature's abundance, only to hoard it for ourselves,
inspiring only envy.

This entire project aims to be a protest against all that and more.

## PART 1: QR code as constructive vandalism

Using mosaic art, I will install a grid of black and white ceramic tiles
designed to look and function as a QR code to cover potholes on poorly
maintained sidewalks. The artwork would be be useful to
pedestrians, whose space and safety in urban cities is quickly
diminishing.

By-passers can scan the QR-code art, or *Q-art code*, using their
smartphone, which contains a link to a website which Part 2 will discuss.

I plan to have installations in at least in four cities nationwide:

- somewhere in NCR
- somewhere in Luzon outside of NCR
- somewhere in Visayas
- somewhere in Mindanao

## PART 2: Website called "Libreng Computer"

The website will be called "Libreng Computer" for the following reasons:

1. It will be the gateway where people, more specifically students (18
   years old and above), will have the chance to get a free laptop,
   whose operating system (OS) and applications will be free and open
   source software (FOSS), AKA ["libre" software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) promoting and
   respecting user's freedoms.
2. It will not be hosted in big social media platforms, free from the
   data harvesting of big tech companies and data brokers that profit
   off of our attention and personal data. Instead, I foresee the
   website's URL
   spreading in friends' group chats, by word of mouth, by stumbling
   upon the Q-art code, and/or via email, among other organic ways.
   Inevitably, of course, this will be circulated in soc-med, but only
   because big tech companies have made it so hard to migrate elsewhere.

The website itself is a protest against the deceptive patterns that
pervade in and around the internet these days. There will be no ads, no
analytics, no trackers, no use of generative AI. Anyone with internet
connection can access it.

There is a link to a questionnaire, to be hosted in
[Cryptpad](https://cryptpad.org/) (*not* in Google Forms), and students
who want to avail free laptop must fill out this form.

### Questionnaire/screener in CryptPad

Applicants will have to be screened via the questionnaire hosted in Cryptpad, an
alternative cloud-based office suite.

The questionnaire will be designed such that only "deserving" students
can. I use quotes because I am of course limited by budget,
time, and personal availability. Broadly, an applicant
will be considered if they are:

- 18 years old and above;
- currently enrolled in a school or university as a student, whether in
  high school, college, or in grad school;
- currently lacks the financial capacity to obtain their own working
  laptop
- tech-savvy enough to know how to use a laptop and navigating the
  internet

Applicants may be asked to provide proof for some or all of the above
metrics, like a valid ID, current electric bill, etc.

Screened applicants will be interviewed either in person, via video
call, or over email correspondence, depending on remaining time and
budget, as the final phase of the screening process.

Once selected, I will share the transcription of the interviews on the
website, partly as proof, partly as a way to motivate others to pay the
kindness forward in ways they can.

Except for students' contact details, data gathered from the
questionnaire will be destroyed completely after the student receives
their laptop and their interview is published on the website.

## PART 3: Giveaway of refurbished laptops for students in need

Instead of gathering dust or sending them to landfill, why not
give old laptops to students in need? The latter is less likely, because
the Philippines has a thriving repair culture.

### Hardware

Each laptop will be bought second-hand from sellers in Carousell. I have
only good experience in that platform, and so I choose it over Facebook
Marketplace.

Any parts that need to be added or replaced will be sourced brand
new to ensure reliability, from e-commerce sites like Shopee and Lazada.
I recognize that these are not the most environmentally-friendly
choices, given the plastic and bubble wrap that comes with each
delivered package.

This is why it is important to choose and vet for reliable working laptops.

For this, I choose Thinkpads, specifically the models T440, T450, and
T460. Thinkpads are known for their ease of repairability,
upgradeability, and overall reliability. I have refurbished a few
Thinkpads myself already, so I can attest to these.

List of possible upgrades and add-ons:
- RAM: 16GB
- Hard drive: Replace with 256GB SSD
- mouse and mouse pad
- laptop bag or sleeve

### Software

I echo my belief in FOSS here. It is imperative that we start moving
away from the big techs' platforms and products when and where we can.

The laptop's OS
will be replaced with [Fedora Linux](https://fedoraproject.org/kde/),
a free and private OS alternative to the Microsoft Windows.

Fedora's user interface will be familiar to a Windows-user, so will be the
applications. Key apps include:
- LibreOffice, replacing MS Office Suite;
- Firefox, a Google Chrome-alternative web browser
- VLC, a popular FOSS media player
- and many more

The more tech-savvy people will enjoy customizing it to their own taste
and workflow.

### Honor-based

This will be an honor-based mutual aid effort. Aside from the screening
process, I won't be making further verification after each laptop is
"awarded." If, in the unlikely chance that, say, the student decided to
sell it, then perhaps its monetary value is the best use case they could
get out of it. Whatever they decide to do with it, I trust their
intuition.

I might do a follow-up interview 6 or 12 months after receiving the laptop, but that's to be determined.

Having said that, I aim to refurbish **four laptops** for this project,
preferably in different locations.

## PART 4: Documentation of the whole project publicly

I find it more useful to share knowledge and insight with the public.
The internet is the best medium to facilitate this.

Not to be confused with Part 2, I intend to document the whole process
of this project in my already up-and-running website:

https://ohio.araw.xyz/project

## Conclusion

I intend to run this project for as long as possible, likely enlisting
help from communities who vibe with the scope of work.
This might be in the form of monetary donation (Gcash, Maya, BPI,
and/or other local financial instutions), or even hardware donation of
working Thinkpads.

As in Nature, everyone thrives when everyone joins in the maintenance of
ecosystems. This *performance art* (if you will) intends to mirror that.
We can do our part to empower each other in ways that need not be at the
expense of our environment.
