I turned from not tracking my steps to tracking them, back to not
tracking them again. This is a quick rant/rave on how a seemingly good
idea can be detrimental to one's mental health as experienced by yours
truly.

Data analytics might help you learn more things about yourself, which
allows you to plan your next course of action to improve your well-being
and/or those around you. Tracking important metrics do help if and when
used properly. The people following and practicing the
[Quantified Self](https://quantifiedself.com/get-started/)
call this "everyday science."

I have been recording a few data points about myself like habits and
meals, which I physically jot on my [analog notebook](/bujo).[^bujo] This way,
I bind myself to visit my notebook daily, even if there's "nothing
else"[^nothing]
to write except these data points.

[^bujo]: In an increasingly *needlessly* high-tech society, choosing
lower tech options is a form of resistance, something I try to do in
every aspect of my life.

[^nothing]: Surely, there's always something to write about. And writing
in itself is a habit that I somewhat track, the record of which is
itself, not data on a separate log.

However, I don't necessarily use them in any meaningful way---at least I
haven't found a use case---nor do I stare at them with maximum intent
expecting to extract an insight about my being. Our ancestors, I think,
did okay not obsessing over the many details about themselves, so why
should I?

As it turns out, I *could*, not for myself but for others.

## Promise of charity

It started when my current employer made a promise. And, of course, we
know what happens to the promises made by top management. Anyway, *Walk
for a Cause* should be about one of our ways to give back to community.
For every kilometer an employee walks, the employer would donate XX
amount in Philippine pesos to a chosen charity, provided there is proof.
The proof, we surmised, would be in the form of a screenshot of a
fitness app of your choosing that recorded your walk.

In reality, it would have been a small scale charity, which is something
I'm not fond of. Charity assumes that the recipient is incapable,
lacking autonomy, or does not have anything to offer back; and it relies
on [inequalities of wealth and power](/empire). I'd rather
participate in [mutual aid](/mutual-aid), though I know that within the
context, it's not going to happen.

**XX**, by the way, is the equivalent to the current amount of a
ultra-cheap candy in your local store. Whatever amount you have in your
head, XX is probably lower than that.

Still, for two seconds, my workmates and I had buzzed at the prospect of
getting fit*ter* and possibly helping others. We set up our fitness
apps, began recording our walks, and even walked to and from work when
normally, we would be in some mode of wheeled transportation. People
would share their progress, because we wanted to inspire one another. We
were dedicated to this thing!

As for me, I used [FitoTrack](https://codeberg.org/jannis/FitoTrack) to
record my walks. Sometimes, I would forget to hit record, and that would
be enough for me to lose it a little. Eventually, I did it enough number
of times that it became a sort of religious experience. When you attach
data gathering (collecting number of kilometers) to a relatively mundane
experience (walking) and make it an important metric (basis for donation
of XX amount), people, myself included, will come up with all sorts of
things to make it in their heads a spiritual practice.

I hadn't needed walking to be a spiritual practice for me to do it; I
already like walking. The ancients had it right; walking clears the
mind. And who wouldn't want that?

Yet I participated in this promise. Because, one thing I haven't
mentioned yet, which was also a major driver for us to join this,
is the social aspect of it. Naturally, my monkey
brain likes socializing.

Walking alone works for certain people. It certainly did help
philosophers enough to write about it.

Walking with friends is nice and lively, as I have experienced.

Now, imagine walking with your community! For a cause at that! Isn't this
why, for some, Strava has become a dating app?

## Back to where we started

Human resources, being the classic HR, deemed that this might be getting
out of [their] hand and decided to shut it down.

And that was that. People no longer shared their progress. They stopped
"walking for a cause." Safety is now the priority. Sure---by remaining
"safe" we have averted a dip in the bottomline, have we not?

I'd like to think that some of us have developed a habit out of it.

I stopped tracking my walks. In a sense, I am grateful, because I am
liberated from the duty of having to fumble through my phone and
record my walk. One less thing to worry about.
