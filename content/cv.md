## Community Involvement

**Silliman University --- Research** (6 months)

Zero Waste Neighborhood Stores Project
(a Silliman University --
University of London SOAS collaborative project)
to develop a national network in support of small,
community-based, Zero Waste neighborhood stores serving low- to middle-income families.

Project Description and Rationale: For more than 500 years,
traditional stores in the Philippines served their communities
through a system of bartering and the use of reusable containers and
dispensing-refilling systems to provide household goods and food sourced from
local farmers and fisherfolk. This sustainable practice was disrupted during the
US colonial period with the entry of industrial agriculture and multinational
corporations, decimating small local farms and crafts industries. Consumer goods
by large multinationals were introduced in small, single-use plastic sachets as
part of a strategy in the 1960s to extract profits from the “bottom of the
pyramid,” that is, from low-income households. Today, Filipinos discard every
day over 164 million sachets and 93 million single-use plastic bags that end up
in our environment. The project, based on the principles of social and
environmental justice, began the creation of a national network to re-envision,
re-create, and support the 1.1 million small neighborhood stores, mostly run by
women, into “Zero Waste stores” which were broadly defined as stores that return
to the traditional reuse-dispensing-refilling system, while also providing
eco-friendly goods in sustainable packaging sourced from small local farmers,
fisherfolk, and artisans, as well as promoting products that build
self-sufficiency.

Activities as a Researcher: engagement with small community stores, conducting
surveys of store owners and customers, gathering of store inventory and other
data, collation of results, and providing feedback on barriers to the expansion
of Zero Waste stores in the country and possible solutions.

**Greenpeace --- Volunteer and Contributor** (4 years)

Volunteered in the Brand Audit 2019, a participatory science initiative conducted along
Manila Bay, Manila, that involved
counting and documenting the brands found on plastic waste to help identify
the companies responsible for plastic pollution.

Provided monetary contributions and supported campaigns that safeguard “the
Filipino’s constitutional rights to a balanced and healthful ecology” including
campaigns on climate justice, opposing plastic pollution, banning the dumping of
foreign waste, protecting the oceans, supporting clean and safe energy, and the
campaign against climate-harmful industrial agriculture and in support of
resilient food and farm systems grounded on ecological farming principles.
