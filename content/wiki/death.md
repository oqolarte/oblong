TRIGGER WARNING: Obviously, this page talks casually about death and
dying. Consider visiting other pages---or clicking away from this site
entirely---if this bothers you.

It is the end state of all living things. The dying part is where it
varies.

## Suicide

Does someone *commit* or *complete* suicide?

Commtting implies a decision has finally been made and enacted.
Completing implies that the process had started some time ago and has
now reached its intended goal.

Completing also appears less defeatist, as if the Void empowers its doer
to reach their "final, fullest form."

I don't mean to glorify it, though. Witnessing it is highly disturbing,
and this is only made possible by technologies that enable
livestreaming. Seeing death this intense will repeatedly prick the body
thousands, millions of times unless it becomes apparent that inaction
only induces pain.

### Choosing Life

As I both continue and struggle to choose life, despite emotional and
mental difficulties caused by Empire, I hurry not to the Void, however
tempting its come-hither blackness. My
[friends](/friendship) and I will be in the future together,
[joy-armed to the teeth](/revolution).
