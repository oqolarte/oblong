It felt like ALYSON (the band behind this 2023 album) were amassing
cheat codes from City Pop and made good use of them to produce eargasms
that, in my opinion, pay homage to the 80s/90s disco-jazz genre from
Japan. And with English and Tagalog as lyrics, I can now actually sing
along to this cohesive work from start to finish.

The musicians and
producers clearly did not shy away from borrowing the "Summer" imagery
in the song "Summer Nights", which reminded me of "Windy Summer" and
"Remember Summer Days" in [Anri's "Timely!!" album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timely!!)

**Rating**:  4 🏙️ out of 5
