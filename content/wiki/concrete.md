Concrete is a composite material which is made up of a filler and a binder.
The binder (cement paste) "glues" the filler together to form a synthetic conglomerate.
The constituents used for the binder are cement and [water](/water),
while the filler can be fine or coarse aggregate (usually gravel).

Just note that concrete is one of, if not *the* most,
[destructive material on Earth.](https://web.archive.org/web/https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/feb/25/concrete-the-most-destructive-material-on-earth)

Concrete also adds to the [heat-island effect](/heat-island-effect)
by absorbing the warmth of the sun
and trapping gases from car exhausts and air-conditioner units.

And so, "No more concrete!" as a protest slogan is a value statement
that we could look more into. While I'm all for it, we could also
consider repurposing existing buildings, instead of just taking them
down, so as to make more use of the concrete---and glass and
metal---that went in them.

"No more *new* concrete if it means destroying and displacing
communities."
