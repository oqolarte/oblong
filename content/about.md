I am a researcher and maker with over ten years of experience helping
people and organizations understand there are better possibilities
outside prevailing systems.

My greatest strength (so far) is writing stories and documenting learnings with
the purpose of sharing them with others.

I am eager to improve the lives of people, myself included, in
communities I am in, because I value the strength and power we possess
as a collective in shaping the Here and Now that we want to live in.

I've always wanted to learn and make something. These
days, that *thing* skews abstract, but I hope to create more tangible
things using different tools ([hardware](/tools) and [software](/foss)
alike) that might be useful. For R&R, I like to read movies and watch
[books](/books) to switch things up

Sometimes, people say [good things](/testi) about me.
