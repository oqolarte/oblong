Every now and then, we might need to buy stuff,
although, I encourage you to [refuse](/refuse) buying new ones.

This list offers how one might buy stuff anonymously.

1. Avoid buying things together. This is especially true if you're
   obtaining materials for a thematic project.
2. Related to the item above, avoid buying things in the same location.
   It's best to do your research first. Scout different stores in
   different locations (preferably not close to where you live), not
   only in search for the best deal, but in so doing also reduces the
   likelihood of each purchase tracing back to you.
3. Highly consider going to the store using anonymous mode of
   transporation (such as a [bike](/bike)).
4. Do not bring a phone as it can be used to triangulate your location.
5. Buy ahead of time before you need to use the item (e.g., weeks or
   months before). This is so that you are not on recent CCTV footage of
   the store or the surrounding area.
6. Consider stereotyping yourself before each purchase. Check out
   popular options and see if they fit to your liking.
7. It should be obvious by now, but don't participate in [voluntary surveillance](/surveillance). This could mean [opting out of credit and/or debit cards and all of their marketing hooks](/no-ads) to make you spend
   more. This includes, but not is not limited to, avoiding any kind of
   membership cards that require you to provide personal details, and
   avoiding cashless payments, especially those that require you to
   provide personal details.
8. Avoid buying from big-named malls.
9. Pay in cash. It makes both you (buyer) and the seller safe, becuase
   neither of you can be linked together, and neither of you can be
   linked back to the transaction. Just remember to sanitize your hands
   after each transaction, as cash is not known for its cleanliness.
10. If you know how, and if the establishment you're buying from accepts
    it, pay using anonymous cryptocurrency, like Monero[^xmr] and
    Zcash[^z]. (Sidenote: Use cryptocurrency *if and only if* you know
    what you're doing. Many people still consider crypto coins as
    unstable currency, so please do your due diligence before dabbling
    in these.)

Note that these steps do NOT make you invisible.
Instead, it aims to make you blend with the crowd.
Now, go do that [project](/project) you've been wanting to do.
