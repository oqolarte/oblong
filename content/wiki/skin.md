## Skin: deep

Everything that matters, including basic needs, is "of the flesh":
feeling, personality, companionship, [love](/love),
[friendship](/friendship), *contact*. All of these are what makes life
worth living. In fact, in his short story *Candido's Apocalypse*, Nick
Joaquin wrote about how skin was deepest thing of all, despite it
residing on surface level (a negative connotation in some context), for
it is the skin which feels contact between humans and the world we all
inhabit.

Joan Westenberg makes similar arguments in her essay "[A World Without Touch Is a World Without Trust](https://www.joanwestenberg.com/p/a-world-without-touch-is-a-world-without-trust)"
