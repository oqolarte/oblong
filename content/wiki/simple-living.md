A simple life, to me, means:

- Not falling trap to the [hedonic treadmill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill),
which means chasing happiness but remaining in the same state.
- Being content with an imperfect life.
- [Being more than my work](/anti-work).
- Spending quality time with friends, family, and [significant other/s](/non-monogamy).
- [Having a small house](/dream-house)
(max of 70 square meters of floor area)
that one, max of two, people can maintain easily.

## Some short- to mid-term strategies to use

- Keep a journal using pen and paper to document life.
Bullet journal has worked well for me.
- When using the internet,
consider using RSS feed instead of getting info
from social media and other distracting sites, but --
- Read the news only at most once a week.
If it's relevant enough,
it will find it's way to you.
- Gaming, especially video gaming,
should be contained
in its own [technology](/technology)/machine.
I used to have a gaming-only PC.
- Put yourself in airplane mode
and disconnect from the internet for a few hours each day.
- Try using [computer](/computer) the Unix way.
Consider using TUI (terminal- or text-based user interface)
for programs that are text heavy, e.g.,
text editors,
email clients,
RSS feed readers, etc.
- Ditch TV.
