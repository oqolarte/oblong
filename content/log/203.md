How many years has it been since I was last inside this old odd
building? The aesthetics and external branding might have been refreshed
over the years, but the overall form remains the same. It's evident in
the funky smell of the restrooms, which, by the way, one must pay for to
enter and use.

Along with other friends and family, I showed up in the
opening exhibit of artworks of Gab Ferrer et al. The event had a
relatively big sound system set up, featured a busy DJ as he constantly
switched records to play good and loud muzak from Japanese artists. I
didn't stick long enough to hear whether he played City Pop songs that I
know and love.
