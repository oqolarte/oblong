## What it is to me

A simple life, to me, means:

- Not falling trap to the [hedonic treadmill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill),
which means chasing happiness but remaining in the same state.
- Being content with an imperfect life.
- [Being more than my work](/anti-work).
- Spending quality time with friends, family, and [significant other/s](/non-monogamy).
- [Having a small house](/dream-house)
(between 40 to 70 square meters of total floor area)
that one, max of two, people can maintain easily.

## Some short- to mid-term strategies to consider

- Keep a journal using pen and paper to document life. [Bullet journal](/bujo) has worked well for me.
- When using the internet, [consider using RSS feed](https://aboutfeeds.com/) instead of getting
  info from [social media](/social-media) and other distracting sites, but---
- Read the news only at most once a week. If it's relevant enough, it
  will find it's way to you through the people around you.
- Gaming, especially video gaming, should be contained in its own
  [technology](/technology)/machine. I used to have a gaming-only PC.
- Put yourself in airplane mode and disconnect from the internet for a
  few hours each day.
- Try using [computer](/computer) the Unix way. Consider using TUI
  (terminal- or text-based user interface) for programs that are text
  heavy, e.g., text editors, email clients, RSS feed readers, etc. A
  great resource is [Terminal Trove](https://terminaltrove.com/)
- Ditch TV. Related to this, ava, in "[death to screens!](https://blog.avas.space/death-to-screens/)" post, talks
  about how they arrive to reducing the screens they use to one.
  Consider if that would also work for you.[^self]
- Detach from roles. You are more than your job, your achievements, or
  your schedule.


[^self]: Yes, that's *you*, Future Self.

## On surviving vs living

Ideally, I don't want to be in a situation of extreme destitution. But
there's no way of knowing what would happen in the future. We might end
up where we didn't plan at all.

To be prepared for the worst but determined to not let it ruin the daily
life---this is a grounded hope that I want to have if I ever found
myself in survival mode. It's like packing emergency go-bags but making
room for the favorite blanket.

## On wealth

Wealth and comfort is relative. But glutton can be seen and judged by
how everything around it behaves, like observing a black hole as it
sucks in the light and distorts its environment.
