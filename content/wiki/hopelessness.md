The line from *Desert* about believing in an all or nothing situation
is what really speaks to me.
If you hope for [anarchy](/revolution),

Anarchy is nothing if not failure after failure on the large scale.
Trying to fight and win on that sort of scale
is just setting yourself up [for repeated misfortunes that come after](/zemblanity).
