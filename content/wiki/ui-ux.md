User Interface (UI) is how it looks
(visual, pertains to colors, typography, iconography, layout).
User Experience (UX) is how it feels
(pertains to navigation, story, how the product interacts with the
person).

When UI/UX is pushed to the side and/or becomes an afterthought,
the result is bad experience, which leads to bad [security](/security).
User research is difficult and time-consuming, and that's probably why
it's deferred.

## Prototypes vs Wireframes

Wireframes is like the skeleton of the product (e.g., website),
while the prototype is the appearance.

Like most products,
the design must produce a structure of what the end result would be
(wireframes).
From that we can start adding the visual elements for the prototype.
