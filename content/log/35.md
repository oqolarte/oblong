- Added four new entries in [Imbentori](/imbentori).

I am now down with trying to make my own text editor, **kilo**,
based on [here](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo).
I have gained a bit of knowledge in C going through the tutorial.
But I need to do more projects in C.
Projects that I myself would be using.

Or at least, I need to look more into source codes of different projects,
and try to understand the design philosophy for each of them.
