## What is it?

One bright day, we were traveling along EDSA---Epifanio de los Santos
Avenue, one of the main highways in Metro Manila, along which, buildings
of various shapes and sizes stand---when I saw a closed-down building
with its few steps to the facade occupied with rolls of barbed wire.
This is **hostile architecture**, designed and installed ad hoc
to deter homeless people from squatting the space. Not to mention, it
also makes any space uglier and less welcoming. Now we can say that we
should not put all faith in [design](/design).

Hostile architecture in general not only targets homeless people, but also
anyone, to limit their behavior in whatever way in public spaces. This
is what happens when [capitalists](/capitalism) conscript designers who
are more than willing to impose hostility to others to protect private
properties from "freeloaders".

Go to any mall, and notice the lack of readily available benches and
chairs for tire people. The floor is not the ideal resting place for
many of us, especially people with limited mobility; and even if one
could sit on floor, not only is it not dignified, it's also prohibited
in some places because doing so is deemed loitering.
