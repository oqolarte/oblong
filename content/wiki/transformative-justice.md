[Transformative justice](https://transformharm.org/tj_resource/transformative-justice-a-brief-description/)
(TJ) is a political framework and approach for responding to violence,
harm, and abuse that changes our communities so that most harm
("crimes") would drastically decrease, an approach that's different from
the current carceral systems in place.

## Intro

We can ask: can crimes of passion be obsolete when we no longer see people
as things to lose or possess?

Consider: Things like theft or property destruction canâ€™t exist if many
of our spaces are communal, and people have enough that they don't feel
like they need more.

[If a community wants to help each other](/mutual-aid), then each
crime is unique and personal. The aggrieved and aggressor are likely
neighbors. A damaged connection might be still be there
and can be healed. If the aggressor is remorseful and
penitent, then the aggrieved may forgive them, and the community might
hold them to certain reparations.

TJ aims to not reproduce the [violence](/violence) of state prisons.
[Isolation and torture are not effective means of reforming](/abolition) those who
hurt others, only deepens wounds.

Restorative justice, on another hand, implies that there's a baseline to
which justice can be restored. But since the beginning, states and
[capitalists](/capitalism)'s [violence](/violence) has been consuming
lives. TJ aims to transform this into something beyond what the current
system can heal, if at all.

## Apologies, Reparations

When you make an apology, it doesn't belong to you anymore. It's up to
the party you've wronged whether to forgive you, and you have to be
prepared for whatever response.

Don't apologize to get forgiveness. That's not an apology but a
transaction. Recognize the mistake you made and the damage you did, try
to lessen the damage, and make sure you don't make that mistake again.
Expect nothing in return for this work you must do.

## Facing discomfort

To realize the impact of your own harmful actions can be heavy and
uncomfortable; and owning up to it is only the first step.

If, let's say, you violated someone's [consent](/consent) and you the
harm-doer are the one feeling worse, the least you can do is to
apologize (see previous section).

If you have ever hurt or harmed anyone, healing cannot begin by escaping
accountability just because you don't like the uneasy feeling of facing
the consequences of your action.

## Calling out or calling in?

Calling out someone publicly, especially in social media, could possibly
by-pass the transformative way of learning and/or understanding where
they could be coming from; and instead becomes a performance to display
one's wit and/or [politics](/politics).

Calling out isn't bad per se;
it's often used by the powerless when following the "due process" hasn't
given them the they are seeking.

### Shaming

One non-violent way of "punishment" aside from removing the tools and/or
the environment that enable the harm, we could start using shame as a
way to discipline wrong-doers. Shame is a powerful social construct. We
can see this in some Asian [cultures](/culture) like the Japanese.

I don't necessarily mean to weaponize shame, as it is done in cancel culture.
Perhaps, we could think of ways to develop social relations that
emphasizes, for example, how shameful it is for one to cause harm to the
community that provides one their basic needs.

Still, it's also worth thinking how we as a community might stop
ourselves from collectively weaponizing shame to, say,
destroy the life/lives of people (a la witch hunt) whose values and
beliefs are not the same as ours.

### [Non-]violence?

Sometimes, talking just doesn't work. *What if* beating up an abuser is
also part of the necessary collective healing process?
