- Edited [About](/about) page.
- Edited [FOSS](/foss). I have upgraded my OS to latest Devuan release,
  "Daedalus".

Like clockwork from Dystopia, many, if not all,
malls have set up Christmas decors on Day
1 of September this year.
Surely a sugar baron sings through their speakers.
(And [did he also share tips for a better work-life balance](https://www.goodnewspilipinas.com/jose-mari-chan-a-sugar-barons-tips-for-a-better-work-life-balance/)?)
This is how we celebrate the late-stage capitalism in Global South.

## Rainy days

As I'm typing this, the sun is already shining,
bringing in that familiar tropical heat and humidity.
But days ago, it had been raining non-stop,
so much so that our wooden doors,
soaked in rainwater, without forcing them wooden close.

I was even able to bike to and from work,
which felt great, because it's been weeks since I rode.

## Thinking about career

In a fit of minor madness due to a recent late night chat on
existential crises, I browsed through possible graduate programs,
putting my stance on not pursuing grad school on shaky grounds now.
My reason for this renewed jazz: to open up more opportunities
that would bump my salary in the future.
That late-stage thingy I mentioned, sadly, operates in money.

[Because of my interest in math](/136/#joyful-maths),
many of the programs I looked up are a bit related to it.

Here's a list of possible careers I eyed on,
ordered from most to least relevant to me now:

- analytics manager
- data scientist
- research analyst
- cybersecurity expert
- [technical] product manager
- statistician

I wonder if I ever get into any of these in the future.
