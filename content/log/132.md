Sometimes, I find time to update this blog.
And when I do, it's mostly *an attempt* at being coherent.

## On passing things

I know time moves on without needing permission from anyone or anything,
and yet it still amazes me when I pause and think of it.

The past few weeks, though, most of its passing is drowned out
with the sound of rain hitting our roof
and gales whispering deathly through the windows.
We're lucky here that recent typhoons have caused no significant damage
in and around the house.

## On integrity

It's hard to maintain integrity in a society
that pushes for convenience.
Doing so will never be a casual effort for an individual.
One is unlikely to achieve it through a strict Morning Routine
if one isn't already a successful person to begin with.
(I can't believe I almost fall for that.)

There are no breakthroughs in keeping Virtue in tact
if not through the friends and family that keep each other accountable,
safe, and courageous in spite of the modern horrors.

## On taking chances

Is it possible to rewire the brain to get addicted to thrill-seeking?

I don't gamble if I can help it,
because I've seen it first hand how playing with odds ruins lives.

But I've known people who fancy taking bigger risks with other people.
Some of them seem to have made peace with whatever the outcome is.
At least, if I understand them correctly, they are willing to bet
on what they believe.
And believing is powerful.

## Recent dreams

It's always non-exciting to read some stranger's dreams,
but I'll share them here anyway.

1. A gay cousin snapped at me for letting my new co-worker sleep on
   their bed sans consent. Understandable, but on my defense, I didn't
   even know that my co-worker had somehow snuck in.
2. I keep repeating a witty phrase to myself, enough to remember to
   share it to a friend who likes capybaras.
3. Someone threw a children's party in a gas station, and I was
   invited. I left for a bit to get something, but when I came back, the
   place was deserted. Did Pied Piper got them?
