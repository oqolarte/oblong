## Brief review of *Cobalt Red*

Authored by [Siddharth Kara](https://x.com/siddharthkara), the book
makes it known that blood is spilled literally on soil of the Democratic
Republic [sic] of the Congo (DRC) in the mad scramble for cobalt. In
that linked Twitter profile of his (feed is in public as of writing
this), he shares pictures and videos from his visits in DRC, a place
plagued by resource curse for centuries now.

Kara had visited DRC to document the modern slavery happening there, and
to meet and interview people---artisanal miners, among others---working
for the cobalt supply chain.

[Cobalt is an important element that is abundant in this land](/cobalt-in-congo).

At least once in the book, this question is posed: "What will this book
do?" Readers may or may not agree with how the author answers this, but
it's safe to say that putting this narrative out there will start a
conversation.

It deals with heavy themes, but the reader needs to confront them as
soon as they are able to, because knowing about how the materials in
rechargeable batteries that power our lives are sourced might just make
us be more mindful of our consumption AND of how hard we should punch
up.

## Spectacular dating shows

Somehow, we got into watching local dating game shows, because we wanted
to know what the commotion was about.

This one show's format, I believe, promotes toxic behaviors from its
participants. Moreover, with cameras pointing at them, they needed to
amplify themselves and set the performance knob past 11.

Participants subject themsleves to unnecessary risks like cyberbullying
and cancel culture which bleeds and affects their real lives, whether
they are aware of it.

Finally, it also brings out the worst qualities among the audience who
watches the spectacle.

## Lindy Hopping

We signed up for one lesson of Lindy Hopping, a dance popularized by
African-Americans in New York during the Jazz era. We learned the basic
steps. At least once in my life, I could say I did try dancing in a
class with other people.

## On convenience

Giving into convenience is borrowing time from the future, and not in a
good way. Somewhere, someone must bear the brunt of risks associated
with propoping up "convenient" solutions for those who can afford it.
Usually, these risk bearers are the manual laborers at the bottom of the
supply chain. But it can be Nature, too, which we cut open to extract raw
materials; and also the communities that are displaced along the process.
