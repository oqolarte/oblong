Notes seeded by reading *Being Peace* of Thich Nhat Hanh.

## "Suffering is not enough"

To bring happiness and peace to others, we must also feel and find them
in ourselves. To do that, [appreciate the simple things](/simple-living),
things that we
take for granted. We can find solace even in our breathing, which is
what most meditation is about.

The moment to *be* alive is the present moment. It means we are not
delegating our lives to a distant future. [Here and Now we are needed](/prefiguration),
and we should also not take that for granted.

We have sovereignty over ourselves even though sometimes it doesn't feel
that way. The [Empire](/empire) constantly tries to take away our control,
even our
attention, even our realities. But deep down, we have the final say on
what happens for us. "We have the seed of everything in us, and we have
to seize the situation in our hand, and recover our sovereignty."

Choosing inner peace is effecting peace. It is a tumultuous world we
live in, indeed, and starting ripples from where we are---like a simple
act of smiling at others, and believing in that smile---will be felt.
