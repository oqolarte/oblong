This week, I:

- resonate hard with Zapatistas' manifesto, "Queremos un mundo donde
  quepan muchos mundos." ***We want a world where many worlds fit***.
  Not just this one run by a [global empire](/empire) hell-bent on
  causing only harm on anything and everything.
- buried a dead stray cat who suffered a violent death. We named the cat
  "Chase" posthumously.
- saw for the first time some of my coworkers in the flesh for a
  face-to-face workshop. It was nice meeting all of them, but in-person
  get-togethers might not be sustainable if commute [to and from Makati]
  is always taxing.
- am glad to note that two of my coworkers, both "AI developers",
  believe that [AI](/ai) as we know it today is "just a hype." It felt
  like they are already exhausted cleaning up after LLMs'
  hallucinations.
- feel the weather getting warmer, mornings getting brighter. I would
  have liked that colder days be extended to March.
