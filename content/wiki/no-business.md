Like many of us, I had dreamed of starting up a small business I
could call my own. Like many,
[I have never liked the idea of working for someone else](/anti-work).
The fruits of my labor have never fully benefited me nor the
people I cared the most. So I thought it might be better for me to start
considering setting my own shop.

## Business Startup Plan

Being my own boss sounded like a lifestyle fit for me.

If you look up on "how to start a business," most of the framework
you'll end up finding goes something like this:

1. List the hobbies you enjoy.
2. From the list, pick one and deep-dive into it. This means learning
   best practices, best gear, finding a community. If it gets boring,
   just pick another hobby to dive into.
3. Find "pain points" in the hobby.
4. Look for solution/s for each or all of the pain points in the hobby.
   Supposedly, this is where you come in.
5. Sell the solution, as a service or product. You'll be asked to look
   for a willing victim, *target customer* as they are called, and make
   the pitch.

It's a simple framework, digestible for a budding
entrepreneur. Since you're starting with your hobbies, the entry barrier
is almost nil, unless you have nothing going on in your life.

However, soon it came to me that to run a business from the ground up,
an entrepreneur must dedicate their whole being into making it stable as
soon as possible. This could mean working upwards of 50 hours per week,
which is definitely more than what I can allot for something, or
anything really, without losing focus.

## Growth mindset is not sustainable

Business analysts, or whatever they are called these days, tend to be
optimistic in their projections. It's always growth, increase in sales,
boost in revenue year-on-year. I doubt that they account for the finite
resources in their spreadsheets. Or maybe they do; they just don't care.

The focus is on making the projections be true. It becomes
the benchmark to chase. And when every business-owner chases loftier
Numbers, the effect can be damaging, although subtle at first.

Bills must be paid. Necessities must be bought. This is our current
reality under [capitalism](/capitalism).
Again it's worth noting that it's naive to
disregard this reality, for the sake of [revolution](/revolution). But if the
Revolution is worth pursuing, the current systems are worth [abolishing](/abolition).

## Generating jobs isn't exactly ethical

What a business essentially does is, it takes the resources from the
community that are by the way already available to them in some form;
funnel these through the operations; [slap a nice branding](/no-ads);
and sell it
back to the community. Along the way, the business employs the labor of
the community, which the community has to... thank for?

Get this: we encourage workers to be grateful to their employers for the barely
living wages as a reward to toiling under dreadful conditions.

If/when the workers realize they would have a fighting chance when they
unionize, they are met with [violence](/violence).

White collar jobs are just as dreadful when all you do is sit in front
of a computer, [hopefully cooking something up](/sabotage) while trying
to look busy toying a spreadsheet or whatever. Modern offices also use up
a lot of energy to run a lot of equipment to sustain the operations: air
conditioning units, lighting, and computers and data centers among
others.[^office]

## Solving a problem doesn't need another startup

We suffer from different problems of varying magnitude. And we will
continue to do so as we discover yet another set of problems that we
don't know that we don't know.

This doesn't mean to scheme another money-making opportunity for each
problem.

I'm certain that we don't need another apartment complex and
condominiums if we're not going to give it to the homeless.

We don't
need another mall, another grocery store, if we're not giving essential
items to those who need them the most.

We don't need these structures if
we're desecrating the land on which they will be erected; and if we're
displacing the indigenous people who have been taking care of the flora
and fauna and living there in peace.

We don't need another diner if we're not going [to feed the hungry](/feeding).

We don't need another plant seller if it means poaching endangered
species from faraway land to import them into our living rooms.

We don't need another private school if we're going to brainwash the
next batch of would-be entrepreneurs into continuing the capitalist
legacy. We don't need them if they're not going to teach the children on
[how to truly care for people and for the environment](/social-ecology).

Ask yourself if we need another manufacturing plant or factory that
enables capitalists to steal from local resources; and then come back to
me with a 200-word write-up that I might append in this post (who
knows).

## Also, you can't *just* start a business

Majority of businesses fail. That's the truth. The odds, by far, are
that you will *lose* whatever you put into it, and end up in a worse
place than when you started.

Even if it were somehow true that anyone could start a business and
expect it to be successful, there would still have to be people who
couldn't start a business, and instead had to be exploited by those more
successful ones. Otherwise, the whole world would consist of owners, and
nobody would do any actual labor. You didn't think that Elon Musk
actually works a billion times harder than you, *'no*?

You might argue, "It's worth the risk." But
[just taking a risk doesn't mean that you deserve something for it](/skin-in-the-game),
especially when that risk only
exists because private property forms the basis of our economic
activity. If all owners really do is assume the risk of ownership
created by the existence of their class, why should that entitle them to
the lion's share of their worker's efforts? Why even have an *owning
class* at all?

If your goal is prosperity for all, which should be the goal of every
society, then this one is a dead end. At best, it's a risky gamble for a
privileged population.

## What then?

Go back to the business startup plan mentioned above. What can you do to
improve the framework so it doesn't need the exploitation of people and
resources?

Perhaps you can encourage others to join you in your hobbies. Perhaps
you can join them in theirs. The point is to [form a community](/community) that
shares something you all enjoy for the sake of enjoying it. To share a
bond with people partaking in similar interests is human nature that
could transcend any profit motive. This way, you also have a chance
[to teach others](/pedagogy) that they might not already know,
and learn from them as well.

When knowledge is made practical in this manner, the community is
empowered to contribute to some other aspects in their lives. The
"product" of this cooperation becomes beneficial to as many people as
possible, and not something that needs to be sold.

### Where to get resources?

Let's be real, though, for a moment. In order to sustain a
mutual-aid-based startup or cooperative, we're going to need resources.
Below are just a few suggestions.

1. **Donations**. Whether recurring or one-time, this is probably the
   best way to get resources. Look up crowdfunding services in your
   area; or online like [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/), [Open
   Collective](https://opencollective.com/), and even
   [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/).
2. **Affiliate and referral links**, by which I mean, linking to other
   similar groups with projects you'd like to support. This is very much
   different from those Amazon and the like, in that we are trying to
   achieve a federation of collectives.
3. **Wishlists**. If your mutual-aid startup already has a list of
   items, materials, and/or tools that you need for the operation, might
   as well ask for those directly. Many people would be inclined to
   donate their junk if it's another person's treasure.
