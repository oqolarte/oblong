I feel there's a fog looming all around me, and it's affecting my mood
all the time. I don't know what it is. It's like the anti-thesis of Tao
in that its omnipresence is the destructive type that slow-burns.

I had little patience listening on things I'm not interested in this
day. The future should be degrowth, a notion that will surely be shot
down at work. All the more we must talk about that, even if my
my words are garbled when they come out of my mouth!
