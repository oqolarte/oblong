After a long bout against the ills of the shuffle button,
I have rediscovered the value of listening through an album
as the artist had intended.
Who would've thought it's better than
shuffling between songs between *multiple* albums *across*
multiple artists?

This month,
I allowed myself to "get in the zone"
while an album of choice is playing in my environment,
skipping no song.
Just playing it one after the other,
from start to finish.
It's a nice change of pace to go with the flow,
and not musical chaos.

The list below, in no particular order,
doesn't necessarily contain albums that I haven't heard yet.
