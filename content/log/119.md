I don't recall the last time March was this relatively cold.[^cold]

It's during one of these cold nights that I had
one of the most intense nightmares so far,
and the friends I told about it agree:

A beige or white sedan stopped at the front of the house,
with its windows rolled down.
The four men inside didn't seem to care
whether the neighborhood would remember how they looked.
From nowhere inside did each of them pull high-powered rifles
and pointed the nozzles to my direction.
When I realized what's going to happen,
I ducked behind the log in our front yard,
praying it's thick and hard enough to shield me
for when the bullets would rain down.

I woke up with my mouth open.
Was I supposed to be yelling?

[^cold]: For a tropical urban area like Metro Manila,
22 degrees Celsius at night is cold.
