My background in engineering has helped me understand more of the world.

To begin understanding a system,
one must look into its components,
and study how each one affects the others.

From [design](/design) to implementation,
an engineer always has to conduct some form of
[failure mode and effects analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_mode_and_effects_analysis)
in which they study when a system fails and how so.

## Creative Problem Solving
Below are my notes from Adam Shostack's course on the matter.

### Creativity in Engineering
- What tradeoffs should be considered in a specific problem?
- Distinguish where creativity is discouraged.
- [You must know the problem and the previous attempts to solve it](/second-order-thinking).
    - Listen to the stories of those who tackled the problem before.
    It could unlock some insight that can help you.
- Elegant solutions are the creative solutions.
    - Is it elegant?
    - Does it save cost?
    - Does it satisfy the end user?
- Action: Write your problem.

### The right questions
- Solving the smaller problems first might open new answers to the
  bigger questions.
- Is this worth solving?
- Understand the problem so that you are closer to solving it.
    - Spend time working on the problem.
    - Explore questions. Ask a lot of them, and in the process you'll
      know which ones are the better ones.
    - Vary your questions if it feels like you're stuck.
    - Be patient.
    - Always iterate.
- Keep scope in mind when evaluating your approach.
    - Small scope can provide an easier solution.
        - Hard problems can be solved by reducing the scope.
        - Minimum Viable Product is the smallest thing you can do to show value.
    - On bigger scope, ask: can a solution to another problem
      complement the one I'm currently solving?
        - Allow yourself to think big.
- [Wording the scope of your problem is important](/writing). Generic words allow
  you to understand the core problems.
- Action: Narrow or broaden and rephrase the problem statement.

### Explore Answers
- Accept that you will fail; failures help us learn,
  and take us a step closer to the solution to the problem.
- Listen to end users.
    - Their feedback, however naive or ignorant, might open fresh
      insights that's grounded on real world problems.
- [Fun can contribute to learning](/pedagogy).
- Find simplicity in your technique.
- Find the strategy, not strait jackets, in connecting the items in
  any list!

### Use your tools
- Use tools to help change something in your problem
    - Change something and see if the new thing works.
    - Add something and see if the new thing works.
    - Remove something, which is harder than adding. Constraints
      forces us to find creative solutions using only what we have.
- Use tools to help explore ideas.

### Test and iterate (or not)
- Creativity isn't the goal. It's to solve a problem.
- Test your idea
- Make a call
- Not every problem is worth solving.
- [Involve others](/mutual-aid).

## Sustainability in Engineering

The attitude of "I'm just following the standard codes" doesn't help in
mitigating the damage done of growing carbon footprint.
To be sustainable, we need to [re-examine our values](/revolution),
our thoughts, and [our actions](/activism).

Engineers must understand intersectionality and how its framework can
be adopted to their work to have [wider social and environmental impacts](/development-engineering).
Remember, [technology](/technology) is never neutral;
knowing this would help in reconfiguring our values
that shape how our tools end up being.
