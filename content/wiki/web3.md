Web3 is a buzzword that simply means having the internet go through the
blockchain,
in an attempt to decentralize it.

This is strange;
small-letter-*i* internet has inherently no central authority.

Or, at least, it start out that way.

Big tech companies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft
are starting their own walled gardens in attempt
to centralize huge chunks of the internet for profit.

Somehow, some techbros think that Web3 is a good response to that.

[*Web3 is going just great*](https://web3isgoinggreat.com/)
is a website that lists the disasters happening in
crypto,
decentralized finance,
NFTs,
and other blockchain-based projects.
