War on drugs is actually an intersection of multiple issues:

- **Class issue**: War on drugs is anti-poor. Only rich people get
  away if they are caught.
- **Gender issue**: Women experience more gendered
  abuses/forms of [violence](/violence) from the police for being drug users,
  drug pushers, or simply by being family members of drug users and/or
  pushers.
- **Healthcare/disability issue**: Marginalized people use illegal
  drugs as a means to access healthcare.
- **Labor issue**: People use illegal drugs to endure inhumane
  working conditions---long hours of physical and mental labor.
- **Education issue**: People get involve in the drug trade because
  they didn't have access to the level of education to enable them to
  find other legal ways of surviving.

The easiest way to dehumanize people, more so in post-Duterte era, is
to say they use illegal drugs. Media is also responsible for
indictment of drug users because everytime someone is arrested for
crime, especially rape or murder; they report that the suspects are drug
users. Drug users are conveniently the best scapegoat to take away
accountability from government for the daily violence we experience:
when you blame a problem to the drug users, no more questions asked.
