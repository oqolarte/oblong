## Intro

Procreation has since evolved from the primal urges of reproduction.
People now choose to have kids for different reasons, some less noble
than others. On the other hand, there are also people who choose *not*
to have kids for another set of reasons.

Parenthood---not being one, I could only imagine how tricky and hard it
is to be a parent. Does having offsprings limit one's freedom, or is
this just Western thought obsessed with individualism?

Perhaps to many, parenthood could be liberating in many different ways.
It could be great [friendship](/friendship) between parents and their
children, if only the former could treat the latter as equals.

## Problem

What happens when parents treat their kids as extensions of themselves,
personal projects from which to benefit later on, as though investment
portfolios could be personified through one's own flesh and blood.

## Possible directions

Needless to say, kids should be their own persons, and be empowered to
have autonomy over their whole being. The role of adults---not just their
parents---in their lives is to be guides: to see to it their basic needs
are met, just like everyone else in the [community](/community); and to see
to it that they may cause the least amount of harm to themselves and to
others.
