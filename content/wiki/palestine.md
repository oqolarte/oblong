*This page includes and builds upon my notes and reflections on Rashid Khalidi's
book* The Hundred Years' War on Palestine. *It is not necessarily a
cohesive view, but I hope they at least give the reader an idea of what
has been happening in Palestine early 1900s to Today. Each paragraph may be
considered a standalone note.*

## Preambles

Yusuf Diya, Rashid Khalidi's great-great-great uncle and a scholar with
interests in comparative religion like Judaism, wrote a letter  to
Theodor Herzl, Viennese journalist and the acknowledged leader of a
Zionist movement, and basically asked to "let Palestine be left alone."

Much later, after World War II,
[historian David Slucki notes](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2979/jss.2009.16.1.111?mag=how-the-jewish-labor-bund-changed-after-world-war-ii),
that bundists,
[a Jewish socialist movement in the late 19th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundism),
would focus on living
"a diasporic reality that carefully balanced the local and
transnational."
Bundists and Zionists, both Jewish groups, are very much different in
sets of beliefs. The former argues for "hereness" ([*Doikayt*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundism#Doikayt)), proclaiming they can live wherever they are. Zionists, on the other hand, wants "thereness" believing that a land, specifically Palestine, is dedicated for a Jewish ethnostate where Jews can thrive.

Going back to Diya, Herzl ignored the main message of the letter. As we
would come to know, Zionist leaders ignore these kinds of pleas, formal
or otherwise, and would go on with their campaign.

Herzl also wanted the native Palestinians already in the place to
"disappear." He had unknowingly pioneered the first concepts of
"[desaparecidos](/216)."

Europeans and eventually North Americans have been the main menaces of
the world for centuries, and I don't think they are stopping any time
soon. The large scale immigration of Jews into Palestine was supported
by the British Mandate.

While Nazis persecute Jews at the time, Jews seemd to turn their hate to
Palestinians and persecute them. The increase in number of Jews in
Palestine provided the manpower for Zionist militias and then Israeli
army to ethnically cleanse Palestinians on their own land.

As with many colonial projects, including Spanish colonization of the
so-called Philippines, [adding biblical flavor](/religion) to the campaign somehow
legitimizes the project. In Zionism, how could Jews bew colonizing
Palestine where Judaism, their religion, supposedly began? The last bit,
of course, is based from their holy book.

Revisionist Zionist leader Ze'ev Jabotinsky was clear that for Zionism
to successfully supplant the Arabs of Palestine, [violence](/violence)
was necessary. This normalization of force is even described by
colonialists as "progress." Zionists has argued, perhaps implicitly,
that being victims of Holocaust gives them "right to discriminate," and
to colonize Palestine to establish their own ethnostate. This progress
would turn on its head when the British and the Zionists had a falling
out.

## First declaration of war, 1917 - 1939

Before the in-flow of British-sanctioned Zionists into Palestine, the
place was under Ottoman Empire for about twenty generations.

Soldiers defecting from army amid an on-going war *is* understandable.
There is no honor in any war in any sides, especially for those in the
ground doomed to suffer from PTSD, if they survive the horrors to begin
with.

Important reminder: British Empire, or any [empire](/empire) for that
matter, is/was never motivated by altruism. Balfour Declaration was
steeped in deception, for example.

Nationalism is usually a response against colonial projects, and against
imperialism landing on the shores and knocking on the gates. Even agter
the dust has settled, people would remain patriotic and would have
stronger ties with the land that is/was being taken from them.

In 1922, the League of Nation's Mandate expanded on the Balfour
Declaration, effectively making an attempt---and so far succeeding in
it---to erase the millenia of people's history in Palestine.

Balfour even hated Jews, as evidenced by the fact that he authored 1905
Aliens Act. Yet, Balfour Declaration would strategically benefit the
British Empire.

In 1933, as Nazism rose in Germany and forced many well-established Jews
out of country, and US and UK not welcoming them because discriminatory
laws, Jews had nowhere to go but Palestine. And they brought with them
assets enough to start gentrifying Palestine in ways a budding
para-state would.

Palestinians were unable to unite against the British Empire and Jewish
Agency because of complexities of their own societies, including
hierarchies, divided politics, and conservatism. The British Empire used
this nuances to further divide and conquer the Palestinian Identity.

Before [*tanim-bala* was cool in NAIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninoy_Aquino_International_Airport_bullet_planting_scandal),
bullet-planting was already being done in Palestine, by Israeli forces
against Palestinians, with far deadlier consequences.

Ze'ev Jabotinsky, and later Woodrow Wilson, envisioned that "Zionism is
a colonizing venture," and ruling the land and stealing it from
"non-Jewish population" would need armed forces.

## Second declaration of war, 1947 - 1948

On 29 NOV 1947, around the same time that Ismail al-Khalidi (author's
father) was talking to King 'Abdullah of Transjordan about how
Palestinians wanted to "control their own fate" and not come under
what would then be Jordan, UN General Assembly decided to be in favor of
the partition of Palestine.

In and around Nakba, Zionism become less backed by the declining British
Empire, and more by the American hegemony in Middle East.

Since Harry Truman's presidency in America, Saudi Arabia has been
dependent on America's economic and military might which continues to
this day, effectively negating any resistance to American influence.
Most Arab rulers were installed by European rulers because of their
being fictile and/or ignorant.

No surprise that Transjordan's King 'Abdullah wanted to expand his
control into Palestine instead of, you know, helping them. Trust no
jesters, kings, lords.

Palestinians have been subjected to three regimes:
- Israel
- Egypt (for those in Gaza)
- Jordan (for those in West Bank and East Jerusalem)

Palestinians have not found reliable allies in Arab nations becuase the
latter:
- have their own economic and political agendas each time they
  "represent" Palestinians;
- are not unified enough; and
- have been afraid of Israel and its superpower allies.

Israeli forces have been killing Palestinian civilians and making it
look like the massacre were "clashes against rebels," a typical rhetoric
used by the state everytime it quashes innocent people's lives.

## Third declaration of war, 1967

Only a few decades after its inception, Israel could already defeat the
combined armies of Arab states at 1967, thanks to its superpower
backers. At the same time, the myth of its supposed existential peril
remains.

The third declaration of war on JUN 1967 came in the form of [SC 242](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_242),
a resolution crafted by US. US and Israel formed an informal alliance,
so that the former could have a footing in the Arab region, supposedly a
strategic place against the perceived threat from USSR.

Egypt's leadership in 1964 founded the Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO) to co-opt and control the rising tide of Palestinian nationalism.
In 1967, in the wake of war, Palestinian militant groups took over PLO.

## Fourth declaration of war, 1982

04 JUN 1982--Israeli forces begain the invasion of Beirut by
dropping bombs on an area of PLO. It's target was obviously the
Palestinians despite being inside Lebanon.

One of the more obvious Isreali war crimes, aside from the existence of
their military might, has involved periodically cutting off life lines
while also bombing Beirut.

Another strategy of Israeli forces was to bomb Beirut "indiscriminately"
even on areas of no military interest, to terrorize Beirutis and turn
them against PLO. This blanket bombing killed many civilians which did
not faze Menachem Begin, Israel's prime minister at the time, implying
that they were necessary collateral damage.

Power is relative. PLO's stay in Lebanon was not benevolent. PLO members
had repeatedly oppressed Lebanese people. They even adopted Israeli war
crimes by lauching offensive on Israeli civilians. It seems like
[Hammurabi's code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_Hammurabi#Laws) has oft been misused throughout history.

## Fifth declaration of war, 1987 - 1995

Soldiers, no matter the power of their guns, still feel afraid for their
lives in very unstable environments. I can't help but think that some of
them must also not want to be there.

PLO trying to co-opt the grassroots led efforts of the First Intifada
would contribute to more failures of Palestinians aiming for
liberation. Indeed, hierarchies *everywhere* *everywhen* degrade human
conditions.

Palestinian-American stand-up comic Sammy Obeid made a [half] joke in
his comedy special "[*Social Justice Jihadi*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLx3xnrQP8o)" (2024) (YouTube)
that his earnings do not go to Hamas, and that he leaves their funding
to the experts: namely, Netanyahu et al.

PLO's major mistakes have been in ignoring the sentiments of grassroots
Palestinians, in ignoring the politics of the superpower that is the US
of A, and then trying to win the affection of this superpower empire.
Western empires, it turns out, operate differently from Arab monarchies.

Pakistani thinker Eqbal Ahmad criticized how ineffective PLO's armed
struggle was against the occupier Israel because their strategy:
- strengthened the victimhood of Israelis given the Jewish history;
- unified Israeli society; and
- reinforced the most militant tendencies of Zionism.

Anti-colonial movements cannot negotiate their nation's and identity's
sovereignity, unless said "negotiation" is either:
- as violent as trial by fire; or
- drawn out so long to more than one generation or lifetime, that either
  side of occupier-occupied becomes irrelevant in the grand scheme of
  things.

SC 242 is a great example of "laws" written by the elite that only
benefits them. Contesting these kinds of laws will both be naive and
impossible to win at.

## Sixth declaration of war, 2000 - 2014

Red tape of Israel ensnaring Palestine is colored with blood. Permits,
checkpoints, and walls and fences have been constructed to regulate the
flow of goods and humanitarian aid.

Hamas was founded at the outset of First Intifada in DEC 1987 as
counter-movement against PLO. According to Hamas, only through armed
struggle could Palestine be free. This rhetoric reminds me of the same
script that
[CPP-NPA-NDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_People%27s_Army_rebellion)
uses to justify their "protracted war" and of course recruit fresh
blood.

Israel helped create and enabled the existence of Hamas. With Hamas and
their knack for violence, Israeli forces has used them to further split
the already splintered forces left among Palestinians.

Of course, I condemn the horrible acts of Hamas which has killed
innocent Israeli civilians. In fact, innocent civilians in any side of a
war do not deserve to be reduced to collateral damage statistics. Having
said that, the biggest losers have always been the Palestinians.

Besides, suicide bombings were a gambit without analysis from
Palestinian leadership. The casualties only strengthened the sentiments
*for* Israel and united their forces stronger, while widening gaps
between Palestinians.

But even then, Rashid Khalidi explains, "Hamas's record paled next to
the massive toll of Palestinian civilian casualties inflicted by Israel
and its elaborate structures of legal discrimination and military rule.
But it was Hamas that was stuck with the terrorist label..."

So long as there's power imbalance among groups of people---whether the
Arab nations, the Left, or your local office place---we should not
expect a lasting unity, if that at all. It is a vague concept, perhaps a
false hope, that people in power would like to use to get you to their
side, in hopes of influencing or controlling your actions.

Barack Obama, during his presidency, had failed to influence the US
government in any capacity to stop supporting the genocide of
Palestinians. Obama, whose middle name is Hussein. Is it because
favoring Palestinians' basic human rights had no strategic value for the
US government?

## TODAY

For Zionism to triumph, it must fully supplant the indigenous people in
Palestine which as of writing this it has failed to do so. With more
critical minds and sharper eyes knowing more and seeing the truths of
the situation, I wager that Zionism is doomed to fail eventually.

Author Rashid Khalidi argues that Americans will find it hard to deal
with the situation in Palestine as long as they haven't fully
acknowledged and made reparations with their dark past including their
genocide against Native Americans and their slavery of Black people.

### Possible ideas for reparations in Palestine

1. Stop the genocide of Palestinian people (and of other neighboring
   Arab nations) by the American-funded Israeli forces.
2. Acknowledge that (Khalidi explains) "conflict between [Palestinians
   and Israelis] cannot be resolved as long as the national existence of
   each is denied by the other."
3. Similar to the previous point, Naomi Klein in her book *Doppelganger*
   asks for a more nuanced conversation, acknowledging Jews escaping
   into Palestine in 1940s were *both* victims of Holocaust (and
   centuries of discrimination prior) *AND* settler colonists who has
   been causing ethnic cleansing to Palestinian people. Victims can and
   has the potential to victimize others. Hurt people hurt people.
