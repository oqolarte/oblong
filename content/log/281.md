My body blitzes through days, weeks. I sometimes fear overstudying its
shape lest a segment turns into an outdated hunk. I am reminded of the
body dysmorphia that men also experience, perhaps underreported. I do
not think I am going through that. Just a curious assessment of my
physique as I [combat entropy](/calisthenics) at this point in life.

[Death of someone in the family](/280) pushes me to reevaluate my positions.
Familiar faces gushed at each other from the gallows, "Is this
going to be our reunion?"

What they mean is, how absurd life must be that friends and family die
[so often](/173) yet spaced far enough in between that wakes and funerals have
become our only meeting places?

It's weird seeing someone from my toddler days. Yes, I remember her
perfectly as this caring friend to Little Me, maybe one of my earliest
exposure to the Great Extrovert energy. She has not aged at all. There
is just this tiny issue: she does not remember me.

Picturesque scenes of Daydreaming take over like antibodies
rushing in with their goal of protecting the host from losing
it.

Later on, to soothe myself, I would binge-watch video essays on
[extreme] minimalism and nod at the insights, as if I had not heard of
them before. Soon enough, though, the video authors' apparent privileges
would abate my interest. *"Monk mode" is already a way of
life for many of the Global South*, I thought. Some other time, I guess.
