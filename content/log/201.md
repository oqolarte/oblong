Only we can define and set our standards of what "greener pastures"
would look like for us.

But what if I want something beyond what the greener pastures offer,
even though by all current metrics, they offer me a better situation?

I think we're destined to be more than just domesticated
livestock---and maybe even liberate [some of] them---for the overlords
to milk dry and strip to the core.

I rarely regret ditching opportunities for greener pasture, because
oftentimes I realize that the cycles of dread and drudgery will persist
no matter how the fields are presented and advertised.

It's hard to distinguish greener pastures from a rat maze, unless viewed
from above.
