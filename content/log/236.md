- Added another [finished book in the list](/books).

## Brief Review of *Dila at Bandila*

[This is a short book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50913852-lasa-ng-republika-dila-at-bandila)
that I started reading during [our last trip to Baguio](/235).
It's a compilation of the author's essays on what Filipino food means to
us, Filipinos, and possibly to the rest of the world, whose opinion of
us we are *really* interested in bordering obsession. Ige Ramos also
questions the motives behind the "standardization" of some well-known
Filipino ulams through echoing the sentiments of food writers and
critiques before him, through many recipes that kind of share the same
structure but differ in ingredients and preparation, and through
personal musings.

My favorite essay is the last one in which the author says that if
there should be a national food *at all*, it should be the *suman*, a
sticky snack that has coconut, rice, and sugar cane as the main
ingredients. Ige Ramos argues:

> Every town in the Philippines, from Batanes to Tawi-Tawi has its
> version... One can enjoy it alone or by many people during events and
> ceremonies... The cooking of suman has nothing to do with [religion](/religion) or
> faith. Whether one is a pagan, Lumad, Muslim, or Christian, it is
> neutral and fair to everyone. It does not discriminate against gender,
> age, economic status, or educational attainment. This is the power of
> suman.

## *Trying* to read more like a grad student

... runs the risk of stumbling into more problems.

During our Baguio trip, I did a short experiment: instead of pulling out
my phone when bored, I would instead pull out a book and read instead.
This is how I finished a relatively short book in a relatively short
span. I hope to finish more books to maybe offset my lizard brain's
desire to chase *only* shallow feel-good things, which I suspect nudges
me to the lower end of intelligence spectrum each time.

It's nothing new, really. People have been reading books out and about. But as
smartphones get shinier and more packed with features, we ask
ourselves whether it is practical to carry a physical paper book with us.

So this little experiment introduces another set of problems.

### Do I only bring small/thin/short books for portability?

Good short books, in my experience, are a rare find. I was lucky that we
have a few in our library that I managed to bring for this trip (and
experiment).

After our small, hardbound copy of Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein*, I'm
not sure what else would be there.

Scouring for small and worthwile reads, AND scoring a physical copy for
an affordable price might not be a sustainable
endeavor in the long run. Clearly, I need to sit on this more.

### Do I read just e-books?

Should I just resort to reading e-books? If so, do I read them from my
phone, or should I get an e-ink reader?

I prefer reading from e-ink displays, to be honest, but since I don't
have any right now, does that mean I would have to get one? I'm trying
to reduce the number of screens in my life right now, and buying an
e-ink reader is the opposite of that.

Also, there are also considerations like:
- how hackable is it?
- is it easy to [repair and maintain](/repair) when, say, the battery
  needs to be replaced?
- can I repurpose it to something else in the future?

### How about audiobooks?

Easy. I have never been a fan of audiobooks, so I'm not even considering
it.

### Undecided

Ultimately, I am, at this point.

The phone stays with me, though, at least right now. I didn't want to
fully disconnect either and/or go off-grid, because that is, for me
right now, such a privileged thing to say and do. Plus, having a map
with GPS saves a spatially challenged someone like me who has not
figured out the compass of the world and has no sense of direction
(obviously).
