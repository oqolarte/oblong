Economics is an analysis of production, distribution, and consumption
of goods and services.

In economics and studies adjacent to it,
I wonder if there was ever a focus on [keeping local ecosystems healthy](/solarpunk),
not just in the cycle of producing, distributing, and consuming.

## *The Market as God*

In their 1999 article for *The Atlantic*, [Harvey Cox found the similarities between religion and economics](https://web.archive.org/web/20230605145139/https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/03/the-market-as-god/306397/)
particularly in deifying the market as [postmodern] god,
that is, omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent
that affects our lives.
In this context, it means that the market:

- can "convert creation into commodities," and everything can be bought.
- can "determine what human needs are," helped by advancing research in
  psychology.
- can be everywhere, even those previously inaccessible to civilization.
  Even an abstract concept like loneliness can have a market.

## What's wrong with markets?

In his talk to Noam Chomsky's class, [Robin Hanhel lists four reasons to reject markets if we want a desirable economy](https://participatoryeconomy.org/whats-wrong-with-markets/)

- Markets allocate resources inefficiently.
- Capital and labor markets are unfair.
- Markets undermine solidarity and promote egotistical attitudes and
  behavior.
- Markets subvert democracy.

### Do we need to ramp up production?

If we even stop and think about the massive global supply chain and the
mass overproduction it triggers to have a functioning society, maybe
we'd realize that all this excess doesn't fulfill anything except
landfills. Nobody needs to buy a new t-shirt every week, and it's better
for our mental health anyways when we're not constantly exposed to
meaningless, cheap, and instant gratification.

The way our economy works (oversimplified) is [COMPANY] stimulates
demand through [marketing](/mr) and then they force some exploited worker to
overproduce [product] to fulfill the artificial demand. Or they do it in
the opposite order.

Most of our production seems to be based more around what we can make,
not what we should make. Nobody really stops to think "Why are we making
five billion pairs of jeans every year?" We surely don't need that many.
Not to mention the environmental destruction caused by the constant
production and subsequent discarding of things. The biggest product of
[capitalism](/capitalism) is waste.

## Economics is a joke

It is sentiment I have heard other people who had to go through it as
college coursework uttered more than once.

Artemis [shares the following their post](https://cozypper.net/2025/07/08/the-way-this-is-not/),
also
touching upon how to some, the market *is* god (hyperlinks added by me):

We should not pretend economics is a science. There should not even be a
Nobel Prize in Economics, and it was not one of the original five Nobel
Prizes.
