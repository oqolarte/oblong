  [Twitter front-end Nitter dies as Musk wins war against third-party services](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/02/twitter-front-end-nitter-dies-as-musk-wins-war-against-third-party-services/).

The birds perched on bamboo stilts, they call me early. I can feel their
dawn songs churning the sweetness in my guts. I know they are not for
me, but I owe them my gratitude.

What do I deserve, then, if not the simplicity of avian muzak? I only
have naive takes on the matter based on my limited experience living
here on earth---

We deserve to live our best lives that don't involve the suffering of
others. That seems like a given, but with the wars the are going on,
many dangerous ideas compel people to hurt Others.

Living our best lives might mean expressing love on Valentine's Day, but
we all know that when we decide to opt in to the 14-Feb gimmicks, it is
also keeping the fad in motion. Surely---and we know this---love,
eternal and radical, cannot be contained in a single point in time.

I want to believe that there's enough wiggle room to build and maintain
meaningful relationships, to look alive in search for joy beneath the
rage if we haven't seen it yet, even when we're thrown to more
soul-crushing systems that push us to be more aloof.
